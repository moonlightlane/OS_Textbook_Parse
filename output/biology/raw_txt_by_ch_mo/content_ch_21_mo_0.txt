no one knows exactly when viruses emerged or from where they came, since viruses do not leave historical footprints such as fossils. modern viruses are thought to be a mosaic of bits and pieces of nucleic acids picked up from various sources along their respective evolutionary paths. viruses are acellular, parasitic entities that are not classified within any kingdom. unlike most living organisms, viruses are not cells and cannot divide. instead, they infect a host cell and use the hosts replication processes to produce identical progeny virus particles. viruses infect organisms as diverse as bacteria, plants, and animals. they exist in a netherworld between a living organism and a nonliving entity. living things grow, metabolize, and reproduce. viruses replicate, but to do so, they are entirely dependent on their host cells. they do not metabolize or grow, but are assembled in their mature form.
