breathing is an involuntary event. how often a breath is taken and how much air is inhaled or exhaled are tightly regulated by the respiratory center in the brain. humans, when they arent exerting themselves, breathe approximately 15 times per minute on average. canines, like the dog in [link], have a respiratory rate of about 1530 breaths per minute. with every inhalation, air fills the lungs, and with every exhalation, air rushes back out. that air is doing more than just inflating and deflating the lungs in the chest cavity. the air contains oxygen that crosses the lung tissue, enters the bloodstream, and travels to organs and tissues. oxygen (o2) enters the cells where it is used for metabolic reactions that produce atp, a high-energy compound. at the same time, these reactions release carbon dioxide (co2) as a by-product. co2 is toxic and must be eliminated. carbon dioxide exits the cells, enters the bloodstream, travels back to the lungs, and is expired out of the body during exhalation.
