a human, as well as every sexually reproducing organism, begins life as a fertilized egg (embryo) or zygote. trillions of cell divisions subsequently occur in a controlled manner to produce a complex, multicellular human. in other words, that original single cell is the ancestor of every other cell in the body. once a being is fully grown, cell reproduction is still necessary to repair or regenerate tissues. for example, new blood and skin cells are constantly being produced. all multicellular organisms use cell division for growth and the maintenance and repair of cells and tissues. cell division is tightly regulated, and the occasional failure of regulation can have life-threatening consequences. single-celled organisms use cell division as their method of reproduction.
