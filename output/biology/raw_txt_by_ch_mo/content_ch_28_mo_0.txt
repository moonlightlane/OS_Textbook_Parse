a brief look at any magazine pertaining to our natural world, such as national geographic, would show a rich variety of vertebrates, especially mammals and birds. to most people, these are the animals that attract our attention. concentrating on vertebrates, however, gives us a rather biased and limited view of biodiversity, because it ignores nearly 97 percent of the animal kingdom, namely the invertebrates. invertebrate animals are those without a cranium and defined vertebral column or spine. in addition to lacking a spine, most invertebrates also lack an endoskeleton. a large number of invertebrates are aquatic animals, and scientific research suggests that many of the worlds species are aquatic invertebrates that have not yet been documented.
