animal reproduction is necessary for the survival of a species. in the animal kingdom, there are innumerable ways that species reproduce. asexual reproduction produces genetically identical organisms (clones), whereas in sexual reproduction, the genetic material of two individuals combines to produce offspring that are genetically different from their parents. during sexual reproduction the male gamete (sperm) may be placed inside the females body for internal fertilization, or the sperm and eggs may be released into the environment for external fertilization. seahorses, like the one shown in [link], provide an example of the latter. following a mating dance, the female lays eggs in the male seahorses abdominal brood pouch where they are fertilized. the eggs hatch and the offspring develop in the pouch for several weeks.
