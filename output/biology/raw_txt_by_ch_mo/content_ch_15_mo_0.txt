since the rediscovery of mendels work in 1900, the definition of the gene has progressed from an abstract unit of heredity to a tangible molecular entity capable of replication, expression, and mutation ([link]). genes are composed of dna and are linearly arranged on chromosomes. genes specify the sequences of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. in turn, proteins are responsible for orchestrating nearly every function of the cell. both genes and the proteins they encode are absolutely essential to life as we know it.
