sexual reproduction requires fertilization, the union of two cells from two individual organisms. if those two cells each contain one set of chromosomes, then the resulting cell contains two sets of chromosomes. haploid cells contain one set of chromosomes. cells containing two sets of chromosomes are called diploid. the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell is called its ploidy level. if the reproductive cycle is to continue, then the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets before fertilization can occur again, or there will be a continual doubling in the number of chromosome sets in every generation. so, in addition to fertilization, sexual reproduction includes a nuclear division that reduces the number of chromosome sets. most animals and plants are diploid, containing two sets of chromosomes. in each somatic cell of the organism (all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells), the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome, called homologous chromosomes. somatic cells are sometimes referred to as body cells. homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing the same genes in identical locations along their length. diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome from each parent; all together, they are considered a full set of chromosomes. haploid cells, containing a single copy of each homologous chromosome, are found only within structures that give rise to either gametes or spores. spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell. all animals and most plants produce eggs and sperm, or gametes. some plants and all fungi produce spores. the nuclear division that forms haploid cells, which is called meiosis, is related to mitosis. as you have learned, mitosis is the part of a cell reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also genetically identical to the original parent nucleus. in mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei are at the same ploidy leveldiploid for most plants and animals. meiosis employs many of the same mechanisms as mitosis. however, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the nuclei that result at the end of a meiotic cell division are haploid. to achieve this reduction in chromosome number, meiosis consists of one round of chromosome duplication and two rounds of nuclear division. because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the same stage names are assigned. however, because there are two rounds of division, the major process and the stages are designated with a i or a ii. thus, meiosis i is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase i, prometaphase i, and so on. meiosis ii, in which the second round of meiotic division takes place, includes prophase ii, prometaphase ii, and so on. meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of the g1, s, and g2 phases, which are nearly identical to the phases preceding mitosis. the g1 phase, which is also called the first gap phase, is the first phase of the interphase and is focused on cell growth. the s phase is the second phase of interphase, during which the dna of the chromosomes is replicated. finally, the g2 phase, also called the second gap phase, is the third and final phase of interphase; in this phase, the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis. during dna duplication in the s phase, each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies, called sister chromatids, that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins. cohesin holds the chromatids together until anaphase ii. the centrosomes, which are the structures that organize the microtubules of the meiotic spindle, also replicate. this prepares the cell to enter prophase i, the first meiotic phase. early in prophase i, before the chromosomes can be seen clearly microscopically, the homologous chromosomes are attached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins. as the nuclear envelope begins to break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair close to each other.  recall that, in mitosis, homologous chromosomes do not pair together. in mitosis, homologous chromosomes line up end-to-end so that when they divide, each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair. the synaptonemal complex, a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes. the tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis. in synapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other. the synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non-sister homologous chromatids, a process called crossing over. crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata (singular = chiasma) ([link]). in species such as humans, even though the x and y sex chromosomes are not homologous (most of their genes differ), they have a small region of homology that allows the x and y chromosomes to pair up during prophase i. a partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology. located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules. these assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossoveror genetic recombinationbetween the non-sister chromatids. near the recombination nodule on each chromatid, the double-stranded dna is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the non-sister chromatids. as prophase i progresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense. when the synaptonemal complex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata. the chiasmata remain until anaphase i. the number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome. there must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis i, but there may be as many as 25. following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed. at the end of prophase i, the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata ([link]) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible. the crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. a single crossover event between homologous non-sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent dna between a maternal chromosome and a paternal chromosome. now, when that sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some dna from one parent of the individual and some dna from the other parent. the sister recombinant chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover. multiple crossovers in an arm of the chromosome have the same effect, exchanging segments of dna to create recombinant chromosomes. the key event in prometaphase i is the attachment of the spindle fiber microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at the centromeres. kinetochore proteins are multiprotein complexes that bind the centromeres of a chromosome to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. microtubules grow from centrosomes placed at opposite poles of the cell. the microtubules move toward the middle of the cell and attach to one of the two fused homologous chromosomes. the microtubules attach at each chromosomes' kinetochores. with each member of the homologous pair attached to opposite poles of the cell, in the next phase, the microtubules can pull the homologous pair apart. a spindle fiber that has attached to a kinetochore is called a kinetochore microtubule. at the end of prometaphase i, each tetrad is attached to microtubules from both poles, with one homologous chromosome facing each pole. the homologous chromosomes are still held together at chiasmata. in addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down entirely. during metaphase i, the homologous chromosomes are arranged in the center of the cell with the kinetochores facing opposite poles.  the homologous pairs orient themselves randomly at the equator. for example, if the two homologous members of chromosome 1 are labeled a and b, then the chromosomes could line up a-b, or b-a. this is important in determining the genes carried by a gamete, as each will only receive one of the two homologous chromosomes. recall that homologous chromosomes are not identical. they contain slight differences in their genetic information, causing each gamete to have a unique genetic makeup. this randomness is the physical basis for the creation of the second form of genetic variation in offspring. consider that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate sets, one from each parent. using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother. the father provides the other set of 23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg. every cell of the multicellular offspring has copies of the original two sets of homologous chromosomes. in prophase i of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes form the tetrads. in metaphase i, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell to form the metaphase plate. because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome, the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. any maternally inherited chromosome may face either pole. any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole. the orientation of each tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads. this eventthe random (or independent) assortment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plateis the second mechanism that introduces variation into the gametes or spores. in each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of the tetrads is different. the number of variations is dependent on the number of chromosomes making up a set. there are two possibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate; the possible number of alignments therefore equals 2n, where n is the number of chromosomes per set. humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million (223) possible genetically-distinct gametes. this number does not include the variability that was previously created in the sister chromatids by crossover. given these two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic composition ([link]). to summarize the genetic consequences of meiosis i, the maternal and paternal genes are recombined by crossover events that occur between each homologous pair during prophase i. in addition, the random assortment of tetrads on the metaphase plate produces a unique combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes that will make their way into the gametes. in anaphase i, the microtubules pull the linked chromosomes apart. the sister chromatids remain tightly bound together at the centromere. the chiasmata are broken in anaphase i as the microtubules attached to the fused kinetochores pull the homologous chromosomes apart ([link]). in telophase, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles. the remainder of the typical telophase events may or may not occur, depending on the species. in some organisms, the chromosomes decondense and nuclear envelopes form around the chromatids in telophase i. in other organisms, cytokinesisthe physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cellsoccurs without reformation of the nuclei. in nearly all species of animals and some fungi, cytokinesis separates the cell contents via a cleavage furrow (constriction of the actin ring that leads to cytoplasmic division). in plants, a cell plate is formed during cell cytokinesis by golgi vesicles fusing at the metaphase plate. this cell plate will ultimately lead to the formation of cell walls that separate the two daughter cells. two haploid cells are the end result of the first meiotic division. the cells are haploid because at each pole, there is just one of each pair of the homologous chromosomes. therefore, only one full set of the chromosomes is present. this is why the cells are considered haploidthere is only one chromosome set, even though each homolog still consists of two sister chromatids.  recall that sister chromatids are merely duplicates of one of the two homologous chromosomes (except for changes that occurred during crossing over). in meiosis ii, these two sister chromatids will separate, creating four haploid daughter cells.  in some species, cells enter a brief interphase, or interkinesis, before entering meiosis ii. interkinesis lacks an s phase, so chromosomes are not duplicated. the two cells produced in meiosis i go through the events of meiosis ii in synchrony. during meiosis ii, the sister chromatids within the two daughter cells separate, forming four new haploid gametes. the mechanics of meiosis ii is similar to mitosis, except that each dividing cell has only one set of homologous chromosomes. therefore, each cell has half the number of sister chromatids to separate out as a diploid cell undergoing mitosis. if the chromosomes decondensed in telophase i, they condense again. if nuclear envelopes were formed, they fragment into vesicles. the centrosomes that were duplicated during interkinesis move away from each other toward opposite poles, and new spindles are formed. the nuclear envelopes are completely broken down, and the spindle is fully formed. each sister chromatid forms an individual kinetochore that attaches to microtubules from opposite poles. the sister chromatids are maximally condensed and aligned at the equator of the cell. the sister chromatids are pulled apart by the kinetochore microtubules and move toward opposite poles. non-kinetochore microtubules elongate the cell. the chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense. nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes. cytokinesis separates the two cells into four unique haploid cells. at this point, the newly formed nuclei are both haploid. the cells produced are genetically unique because of the random assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and because of the recombining of maternal and paternal segments of chromosomes (with their sets of genes) that occurs during crossover. the entire process of meiosis is outlined in [link]. mitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. they share some similarities, but also exhibit distinct differences that lead to very different outcomes ([link]). mitosis is a single nuclear division that results in two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells. the nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically identical to the original nucleus. they have the same number of sets of chromosomes, one set in the case of haploid cells and two sets in the case of diploid cells. in most plants and all animal species, it is typically diploid cells that undergo mitosis to form new diploid cells. in contrast, meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that are usually partitioned into four new cells. the nuclei resulting from meiosis are not genetically identical and they contain one chromosome set only. this is half the number of chromosome sets in the original cell, which is diploid. the main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis i, which is a very different nuclear division than mitosis. in meiosis i, the homologous chromosome pairs become associated with each other, are bound together with the synaptonemal complex, develop chiasmata and undergo crossover between sister chromatids, and line up along the metaphase plate in tetrads with kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog in a tetrad. all of these events occur only in meiosis i. when the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another, the ploidy levelthe number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleushas been reduced from two to one. for this reason, meiosis i is referred to as a reduction division. there is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis. meiosis ii is much more analogous to a mitotic division. in this case, the duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line up on the metaphase plate with divided kinetochores attached to kinetochore fibers from opposite poles. during anaphase ii, as in mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatidnow referred to as a chromosomeis pulled to one pole while the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. if it were not for the fact that there had been crossover, the two products of each individual meiosis ii division would be identical (like in mitosis). instead, they are different because there has always been at least one crossover per chromosome. meiosis ii is not a reduction division because although there are fewer copies of the genome in the resulting cells, there is still one set of chromosomes, as there was at the end of meiosis i. the mystery of the evolution of meiosissome characteristics of organisms are so widespread and fundamental that it is sometimes difficult to remember that they evolved like other simpler traits. meiosis is such an extraordinarily complex series of cellular events that biologists have had trouble hypothesizing and testing how it may have evolved. although meiosis is inextricably entwined with sexual reproduction and its advantages and disadvantages, it is important to separate the questions of the evolution of meiosis and the evolution of sex, because early meiosis may have been advantageous for different reasons than it is now. thinking outside the box and imagining what the early benefits from meiosis might have been is one approach to uncovering how it may have evolved. meiosis and mitosis share obvious cellular processes and it makes sense that meiosis evolved from mitosis. the difficulty lies in the clear differences between meiosis i and mitosis. adam wilkins and robin holliday1 summarized the unique events that needed to occur for the evolution of meiosis from mitosis. these steps are homologous chromosome pairing, crossover exchanges, sister chromatids remaining attached during anaphase, and suppression of dna replication in interphase. they argue that the first step is the hardest and most important, and that understanding how it evolved would make the evolutionary process clearer. they suggest genetic experiments that might shed light on the evolution of synapsis. there are other approaches to understanding the evolution of meiosis in progress. different forms of meiosis exist in single-celled protists. some appear to be simpler or more primitive forms of meiosis. comparing the meiotic divisions of different protists may shed light on the evolution of meiosis. marilee ramesh and colleagues2 compared the genes involved in meiosis in protists to understand when and where meiosis might have evolved. although research is still ongoing, recent scholarship into meiosis in protists suggests that some aspects of meiosis may have evolved later than others. this kind of genetic comparison can tell us what aspects of meiosis are the oldest and what cellular processes they may have borrowed from in earlier cells. sexual reproduction requires that diploid organisms produce haploid cells that can fuse during fertilization to form diploid offspring. as with mitosis, dna replication occurs prior to meiosis during the s-phase of the cell cycle. meiosis is a series of events that arrange and separate chromosomes and chromatids into daughter cells. during the interphases of meiosis, each chromosome is duplicated. in meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear division resulting in four nuclei and usually four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. the first separates homologs, and the secondlike mitosisseparates chromatids into individual chromosomes. during meiosis, variation in the daughter nuclei is introduced because of crossover in prophase i and random alignment of tetrads at metaphase i. the cells that are produced by meiosis are genetically unique. meiosis and mitosis share similarities, but have distinct outcomes. mitotic divisions are single nuclear divisions that produce daughter nuclei that are genetically identical and have the same number of chromosome sets as the original cell. meiotic divisions include two nuclear divisions that produce four daughter nuclei that are genetically different and have one chromosome set instead of the two sets of chromosomes in the parent cell. the main differences between the processes occur in the first division of meiosis, in which homologous chromosomes are paired and exchange non-sister chromatid segments. the homologous chromosomes separate into different nuclei during meiosis i, causing a reduction of ploidy level in the first division. the second division of meiosis is more similar to a mitotic division, except that the daughter cells do not contain identical genomes because of crossover. adam s. wilkins and robin holliday, the evolution of meiosis from mitosis, genetics 181 (2009): 312. marilee a. ramesh, shehre-banoo malik and
