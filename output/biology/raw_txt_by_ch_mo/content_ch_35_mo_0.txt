when youre reading this book, your nervous system is performing several functions simultaneously. the visual system is processing what is seen on the page; the motor system controls the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains attention. even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous system. a nervous system is an organisms control center: it processes sensory information from outside (and inside) the body and controls all behaviorsfrom eating to sleeping to finding a mate.
