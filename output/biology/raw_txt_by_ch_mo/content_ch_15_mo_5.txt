the synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cells energy than any other metabolic process. in turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually every function of a cell. the process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mrna message into a polypeptide product. amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino acid residues to more than 1,000. each individual amino acid has an amino group (nh2) and a carboxyl (cooh) group. polypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide) bond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid ([link]). this reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates one water molecule. in addition to the mrna template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation. the composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of rrnas and polypeptides depending on the organism. however, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells. translation requires the input of an mrna template, ribosomes, trnas, and various enzymatic factors. even before an mrna is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes. in e. coli, there are  between 10,000 and 70,000  ribosomes present in each cell at any given time. a ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rrnas, and many distinct polypeptides. in eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rrnas. ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the cytoplasm.  ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation. in e. coli, the small subunit is described as 30s, and the large subunit is 50s, for a total of 70s (recall that svedberg units are not additive). mammalian ribosomes have a small 40s subunit and a large 60s subunit, for a total of 80s. the small subunit is responsible for binding the mrna template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds trnas. each mrna molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction: reading the mrna from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the n terminus to the c terminus. the complete mrna/poly-ribosome structure is called a polysome. the trnas are structural rna molecules that were transcribed from genes by rna polymerase iii. depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of trnas exist in the cytoplasm. serving as adaptors, specific trnas bind to sequences on the mrna template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. therefore, trnas are the molecules that actually translate the language of rna into the language of proteins. of the 64 possible mrna codonsor triplet combinations of a, u, g, and cthree specify the termination of protein synthesis and 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. of these 61, one codon (aug) also encodes the initiation of translation. each trna anticodon can base pair with one of the mrna codons and add an amino acid or terminate translation, according to the genetic code. for instance, if the sequence cua occurred on an mrna template in the proper reading frame, it would bind a trna expressing the complementary sequence, gau, which would be linked to the amino acid leucine. as the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that trnas can fit so much specificity into such a small package. consider that trnas need to interact with three factors:  1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase (see below); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mrna. the process of pre-trna synthesis by rna polymerase iii only creates the rna portion of the adaptor molecule. the corresponding amino acid must be added later, once the trna is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. through the process of trna charging, each trna molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl trna synthetases. at least one type of aminoacyl trna synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of aminoacyl trna synthetases varies by species. these enzymes first bind and hydrolyze atp to catalyze a high-energy bond between an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (amp); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction. the activated amino acid is then transferred to the trna, and amp is released. as with mrna synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. the process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. here well explore how translation occurs in e. coli, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation. protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. in e. coli, this complex involves the small 30s ribosome, the mrna template, three initiation factors (ifs; if-1, if-2, and if-3), and a special initiator trna, called

 at the beginning of every polypeptide chain synthesized by e. coli, but it is usually clipped off after translation is complete. when an in-frame aug is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular met-trnamet. in e. coli mrna, a sequence upstream of the first aug codon, called the shine-dalgarno sequence (aggagg), interacts with the rrna molecules that compose the ribosome. this interaction anchors the 30s ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mrna template. guanosine triphosphate (gtp), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during translationboth at the start of elongation and during the ribosomes translocation. in eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mrna, the 40s small ribosomal subunit, ifs, and nucleoside triphosphates (gtp and atp). the charged initiator trna, called met-trnai, does not bind fmet in eukaryotes, but is distinct from other met-trnas in that it can bind ifs. instead of depositing at the shine-dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mrna. a cap-binding protein (cbp) and several other ifs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap. once at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mrna in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the aug start codon. many eukaryotic mrnas are translated from the first aug, but this is not always the case. according to kozaks rules, the nucleotides around the aug indicate whether it is the correct start codon. kozaks rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the aug of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccrccaugg-3'. the r (for purine) indicates a site that can be either a or g, but cannot be c or u. essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation. once the appropriate aug is identified, the other proteins and cbp dissociate, and the 60s subunit binds to the complex of met-trnai, mrna, and the 40s subunit. this step completes the initiation of translation in eukaryotes. in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective of e. coli. the 50s ribosomal subunit of e. coli consists of three compartments: the a (aminoacyl) site binds incoming charged aminoacyl trnas. the p (peptidyl) site binds charged trnas carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding trna. the e (exit) site releases dissociated trnas so that they can be recharged with free amino acids. there is one exception to this assembly line of trnas: in e. coli,

 is capable of entering the p site directly without first entering the a site. similarly, the eukaryotic met-trnai, with help from other proteins of the initiation complex, binds directly to the p site. in both cases, this creates an initiation complex with a free a site ready to accept the trna corresponding to the first codon after the aug. during translation elongation, the mrna template provides specificity. as the ribosome moves along the mrna, each mrna codon comes into register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged trna anticodon is ensured. if mrna were not present in the elongation complex, the ribosome would bind trnas nonspecifically. elongation proceeds with charged trnas entering the a site and then shifting to the p site followed by the e site with each single-codon step of the ribosome. ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3' direction. the energy for each step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes gtp. peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the a-site trna and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the p-site trna. the formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an rna-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50s ribosomal subunit. the energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from gtp hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor. the amino acid bound to the p-site trna is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain. as the ribosome steps across the mrna, the former p-site trna enters the e site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled ([link]). amazingly, the e. coli translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds. termination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon (uaa, uag, or uga) is encountered. upon aligning with the a site, these nonsense codons are recognized by release factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that instruct peptidyl transferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the p-site amino acid. this reaction forces the p-site amino acid to detach from its trna, and the newly made protein is released. the small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mrna and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex. after many ribosomes have completed translation, the mrna is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused in another transcription reaction. during and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences may be appended, and the new protein folds into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions. a signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment. these sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the proteins train ticket to its ultimate destination. other cellular factors recognize each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to its correct compartment. for instance, a specific sequence at the amino terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in plants). once the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is usually clipped off. many proteins fold spontaneously, but some proteins require helper molecules, called chaperones, to prevent them from aggregating during the complicated process of folding. even if a protein is properly specified by its corresponding mrna, it could take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or ph conditions prevent it from folding correctly. the players in translation include the mrna template, ribosomes, trnas, and various enzymatic factors. the small ribosomal subunit forms on the mrna template either at the shine-dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or the 5' cap (eukaryotes). translation begins at the initiating aug on the mrna, specifying methionine. the formation of peptide bonds occurs between sequential amino acids specified by the mrna template according to the genetic code. charged trnas enter the ribosomal a site, and their amino acid bonds with the amino acid at the p site. the entire mrna is translated in three-nucleotide steps of the ribosome. when a nonsense codon is encountered, a release factor binds and dissociates the components and frees the new protein. folding of the protein occurs during and after translation.
