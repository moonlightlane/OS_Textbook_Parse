1,stax-bio,1,The Study of Life,1,m44387,The Science of Biology,"what is biology? in simple terms, biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments. this is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast. biologists may study anything from the microscopic or submicroscopic view of a cell to ecosystems and the whole living planet ([link]). listening to the daily news, you will quickly realize how many aspects of biology are discussed every day. for example, recent news topics include escherichia coli ([link]) outbreaks in spinach and salmonella contamination in peanut butter. other subjects include efforts toward finding a cure for aids, alzheimers disease, and cancer. on a global scale, many researchers are committed to finding ways to protect the planet, solve environmental issues, and reduce the effects of climate change. all of these diverse endeavors are related to different facets of the discipline of biology. biology is a science, but what exactly is science? what does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines? science (from the latin scientia, meaning knowledge) can be defined as knowledge that covers general truths or the operation of general laws, especially when acquired and tested by the scientific method. it becomes clear from this definition that the application of the scientific method plays a major role in science. the scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation. the steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses by means of repeatable experiments. a hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested. although using the scientific method is inherent to science, it is inadequate in determining what science is. this is because it is relatively easy to apply the scientific method to disciplines such as physics and chemistry, but when it comes to disciplines like archaeology, psychology, and geology, the scientific method becomes less applicable as it becomes more difficult to repeat experiments. these areas of study are still sciences, however. consider archeologyeven though one cannot perform repeatable experiments, hypotheses may still be supported. for instance, an archeologist can hypothesize that an ancient culture existed based on finding a piece of pottery. further hypotheses could be made about various characteristics of this culture, and these hypotheses may be found to be correct or false through continued support or contradictions from other findings. a hypothesis may become a verified theory. a theory is a tested and confirmed explanation for observations or phenomena. science may be better defined as fields of study that attempt to comprehend the nature of the universe. what would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? frogs? plants? dinosaur skeletons? exhibits about how the brain functions? a planetarium? gems and minerals? or, maybe all of the above? science includes such diverse fields as astronomy, biology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics ([link]). however, those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered natural sciences. thus, a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above. there is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include, however. for some experts, the natural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences, which study living things and include biology, and physical sciences, which study nonliving matter and include astronomy, geology, physics, and chemistry. some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on both life and physical sciences and are interdisciplinary. natural sciences are sometimes referred to as hard science because they rely on the use of quantitative data; social sciences that study society and human behavior are more likely to use qualitative assessments to drive investigations and findings. not surprisingly, the natural science of biology has many branches or subdisciplines. cell biologists study cell structure and function, while biologists who study anatomy investigate the structure of an entire organism. those biologists studying physiology, however, focus on the internal functioning of an organism. some areas of biology focus on only particular types of living things. for example, botanists explore plants, while zoologists specialize in animals. one thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal to know. curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces for the development of science. scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates. to do this, they use two methods of logical thinking: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. inductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion. this type of reasoning is common in descriptive science. a life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and records them. these data can be qualitative or quantitative, and the raw data can be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. from many observations, the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on evidence. inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. brain studies provide an example. in this type of research, many live brains are observed while people are doing a specific activity, such as viewing images of food. the part of the brain that lights up during this activity is then predicted to be the part controlling the response to the selected stimulus, in this case, images of food. the lighting up of the various areas of the brain is caused by excess absorption of radioactive sugar derivatives by active areas of the brain. the resultant increase in radioactivity is observed by a scanner. then, researchers can stimulate that part of the brain to see if similar responses result. deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. in deductive reason, the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning. deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results. from those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. studies in climate change can illustrate this type of reasoning. for example, scientists may predict that if the climate becomes warmer in a particular region, then the distribution of plants and animals should change. these predictions have been made and tested, and many such changes have been found, such as the modification of arable areas for agriculture, with change based on temperature averages. both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and hypothesis-based science. descriptive (or discovery) science, which is usually inductive, aims to observe, explore, and discover, while hypothesis-based science, which is usually deductive, begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested. the boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, and most scientific endeavors combine both approaches. the fuzzy boundary becomes apparent when thinking about how easily observation can lead to specific questions. for example, a gentleman in the 1940s observed that the burr seeds that stuck to his clothes and his dogs fur had a tiny hook structure. on closer inspection, he discovered that the burrs gripping device was more reliable than a zipper. he eventually developed a company and produced the hook-and-loop fastener popularly known today as velcro. descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue. biologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses. this approach is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. the scientific method was used even in ancient times, but it was first documented by englands sir francis bacon (15611626) ([link]), who set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. the scientific method is not exclusively used by biologists but can be applied to almost all fields of study as a logical, rational problem-solving method. the scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to be solved) that leads to a question. lets think about a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem. one monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. that is an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too warm. the student then asks a question: why is the classroom so warm? recall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested. to solve a problem, several hypotheses may be proposed. for example, one hypothesis might be, the classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning. but there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be proposed. a second hypothesis might be, the classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesnt work. once a hypothesis has been selected, the student can make a prediction. a prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it typically has the format if . . . then . . . . for example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, if the student turns on the air conditioning, then the classroom will no longer be too warm. a valid hypothesis must be testable. it should also be falsifiable, meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results. importantly, science does not claim to prove anything because scientific understandings are always subject to modification with further information. this stepopenness to disproving ideasis what distinguishes sciences from non-sciences. the presence of the supernatural, for instance, is neither testable nor falsifiable. to test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls. a variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment. the control group contains every feature of the experimental group except it is not given the manipulation that is hypothesized about. therefore, if the results of the experimental group differ from the control group, the difference must be due to the hypothesized manipulation, rather than some outside factor. look for the variables and controls in the examples that follow. to test the first hypothesis, the student would find out if the air conditioning is on. if the air conditioning is turned on but does not work, there should be another reason, and this hypothesis should be rejected. to test the second hypothesis, the student could check if the lights in the classroom are functional. if so, there is no power failure and this hypothesis should be rejected. each hypothesis should be tested by carrying out appropriate experiments. be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid ([link]). using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data are rejected. while this warm classroom example is based on observational results, other hypotheses and experiments might have clearer controls. for instance, a student might attend class on monday and realize she had difficulty concentrating on the lecture. one observation to explain this occurrence might be, when i eat breakfast before class, i am better able to pay attention. the student could then design an experiment with a control to test this hypothesis. in hypothesis-based science, specific results are predicted from a general premise. this type of reasoning is called deductive reasoning: deduction proceeds from the general to the particular. but the reverse of the process is also possible: sometimes, scientists reach a general conclusion from a number of specific observations. this type of reasoning is called inductive reasoning, and it proceeds from the particular to the general. inductive and deductive reasoning are often used in tandem to advance scientific knowledge ([link]). the scientific method may seem too rigid and structured. it is important to keep in mind that, although scientists often follow this sequence, there is flexibility. sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions that favor a change in approach; often, an experiment brings entirely new scientific questions to the puzzle. many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion; instead, scientists continually draw inferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as their research proceeds. scientific reasoning is more complex than the scientific method alone suggests. notice, too, that the scientific method can be applied to solving problems that arent necessarily scientific in nature. the scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the value of different types of science. is it valuable to pursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have worth if we can apply it to solving a specific problem or to bettering our lives? this question focuses on the differences between two types of science: basic science and applied science. basic science or pure science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that knowledge. it is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. the immediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledges sake, though this does not mean that, in the end, it may not result in a practical application. in contrast, applied science or technology, aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible, for example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster ([link]). in applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher. some individuals may perceive applied science as useful and basic science as useless. a question these people might pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, what for? a careful look at the history of science, however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. many scientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore, applied science relies on the results generated through basic science. other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems. both approaches are valid. it is true that there are problems that demand immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of the wide knowledge foundation generated through basic science. one example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of dna structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing dna replication. strands of dna, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life. during dna replication, dna makes new copies of itself, shortly before a cell divides. understanding the mechanisms of dna replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to identify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine paternity. without basic science, it is unlikely that applied science would exist. another example of the link between basic and applied research is the human genome project, a study in which each human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine the precise sequence of dna subunits and the exact location of each gene. (the gene is the basic unit of heredity; an individuals complete collection of genes is his or her genome.) other less complex organisms have also been studied as part of this project in order to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes. the human genome project ([link]) relied on basic research carried out with simple organisms and, later, with the human genome. an important end goal eventually became using the data for applied research, seeking cures and early diagnoses for genetically related diseases. while research efforts in both basic science and applied science are usually carefully planned, it is important to note that some discoveries are made by serendipity, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise. penicillin was discovered when biologist alexander fleming accidentally left a petri dish of staphylococcus bacteria open. an unwanted mold grew on the dish, killing the bacteria. the mold turned out to be penicillium, and a new antibiotic was discovered. even in the highly organized world of science, luckwhen combined with an observant, curious mindcan lead to unexpected breakthroughs. whether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings in order for other researchers to expand and build upon their discoveries. collaboration with other scientistswhen planning, conducting, and analyzing resultsare all important for scientific research. for this reason, important aspects of a scientists work are communicating with peers and disseminating results to peers. scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the select few who are present. instead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed manuscripts that are published in scientific journals. peer-reviewed manuscripts are scientific papers that are reviewed by a scientists colleagues, or peers. these colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who judge whether or not the scientists work is suitable for publication. the process of peer review helps to ensure that the research described in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. grant proposals, which are requests for research funding, are also subject to peer review. scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. the experimental results must be consistent with the findings of other scientists. a scientific paper is very different from creative writing. although creativity is required to design experiments, there are fixed guidelines when it comes to presenting scientific results. first, scientific writing must be brief, concise, and accurate. a scientific paper needs to be succinct but detailed enough to allow peers to reproduce the experiments. the scientific paper consists of several specific sectionsintroduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion. this structure is sometimes called the imrad format. there are usually acknowledgment and reference sections as well as an abstract (a concise summary) at the beginning of the paper. there might be additional sections depending on the type of paper and the journal where it will be published; for example, some review papers require an outline. the introduction starts with brief, but broad, background information about what is known in the field. a good introduction also gives the rationale of the work; it justifies the work carried out and also briefly mentions the end of the paper, where the hypothesis or research question driving the research will be presented. the introduction refers to the published scientific work of others and therefore requires citations following the style of the journal. using the work or ideas of others without proper citation is considered plagiarism. the materials and methods section includes a complete and accurate description of the substances used, and the method and techniques used by the researchers to gather data. the description should be thorough enough to allow another researcher to repeat the experiment and obtain similar results, but it does not have to be verbose. this section will also include information on how measurements were made and what types of calculations and statistical analyses were used to examine raw data. although the materials and methods section gives an accurate description of the experiments, it does not discuss them. some journals require a results section followed by a discussion section, but it is more common to combine both. if the journal does not allow the combination of both sections, the results section simply narrates the findings without any further interpretation. the results are presented by means of tables or graphs, but no duplicate information should be presented. in the discussion section, the researcher will interpret the results, describe how variables may be related, and attempt to explain the observations. it is indispensable to conduct an extensive literature search to put the results in the context of previously published scientific research. therefore, proper citations are included in this section as well. finally, the conclusion section summarizes the importance of the experimental findings. while the scientific paper almost certainly answered one or more scientific questions that were stated, any good research should lead to more questions. therefore, a well-done scientific paper leaves doors open for the researcher and others to continue and expand on the findings. review articles do not follow the imrad format because they do not present original scientific findings, or primary literature; instead, they summarize and comment on findings that were published as primary literature and typically include extensive reference sections. biology is the science that studies living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments. science attempts to describe and understand the nature of the universe in whole or in part by rational means. science has many fields; those fields related to the physical world and its phenomena are considered natural sciences. science can be basic or applied. the main goal of basic science is to expand knowledge without any expectation of short-term practical application of that knowledge. the primary goal of applied research, however, is to solve practical problems. two types of logical reasoning are used in science. inductive reasoning uses particular results to produce general scientific principles. deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that predicts results by applying general principles. the common thread throughout scientific research is the use of the scientific method, a step-based process that consists of making observations, defining a problem, posing hypotheses, testing these hypotheses, and drawing one or more conclusions. the testing uses proper controls. scientists present their results in peer-reviewed scientific papers published in scientific journals. a scientific research paper consists of several well-defined sections: introduction, materials and methods, results, and, finally, a concluding discussion. review papers summarize the research done in a particular field over a period of time.","[('applied science', 'applied sciences'), ('plagiarism', 'plagiarisms'), ('hypothesi', 'hypotheses', 'hypothesis'), ('biology', 'biologies'), ('introduction', 'introductions'), ('hypothesis-based science', 'hypothesis-based sciences'), ('falsifiable', 'falsifiables'), ('experiment', 'experiments'), ('physical science', 'physical sciences'), ('natural science', 'natural sciencess', 'natural sciences'), ('theory', 'theories'), ('scientific reasoning', 'scientific reasonings'), ('result', 'resultss', 'results'), ('peer-reviewed', 'peer-revieweds'), ('material and method', 'material and methodss', 'material and methods', 'materials and method', 'materials and methodss', 'materials and methods'), ('abstract', 'abstracts'), ('serendipity', 'serendipities'), ('basic science', 'basic sciences'), ('review article', 'review articles'), ('deductive reasoning', 'deductive reasonings'), ('life', 'lives'), ('life science', 'life sciences'), ('scientific method', 'scientific methods'), ('conclusion', 'conclusions'), ('control', 'controls'), ('discussion', 'discussions'), ('science', 'sciences'), ('descriptive science', 'descriptive sciences'), ('variable', 'variables'), ('inductive reasoning', 'inductive reasonings')]"
2,stax-bio,1,The Study of Life,2,m44388,Themes and Concepts of Biology,"biology is the science that studies life, but what exactly is life? this may sound like a silly question with an obvious response, but it is not always easy to define life. for example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. it turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. consequently, virologists are not biologists, strictly speaking. similarly, some biologists study the early molecular evolution that gave rise to life; since the events that preceded life are not biological events, these scientists are also excluded from biology in the strict sense of the term. from its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with three questions: what are the shared properties that make something alive? and once we know something is alive, how do we find meaningful levels of organization in its structure? and, finally, when faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand them? as new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions. all living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to the environment, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, energy processing, and evolution. when viewed together, these nine characteristics serve to define life. organisms are highly organized, coordinated structures that consist of one or more cells. even very simple, single-celled organisms are remarkably complex: inside each cell, atoms make up molecules; these in turn make up cell organelles and other cellular inclusions. in multicellular organisms ([link]), similar cells form tissues. tissues, in turn, collaborate to create organs (body structures with a distinct function). organs work together to form organ systems. organisms respond to diverse stimuli. for example, plants can bend toward a source of light, climb on fences and walls, or respond to touch ([link]). even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a process called chemotaxis) or light (phototaxis). movement toward a stimulus is considered a positive response, while movement away from a stimulus is considered a negative response. single-celled organisms reproduce by first duplicating their dna, and then dividing it equally as the cell prepares to divide to form two new cells. multicellular organisms often produce specialized reproductive germline cells that will form new individuals. when reproduction occurs, genes containing dna are passed along to an organisms offspring. these genes ensure that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have similar characteristics, such as size and shape. organisms grow and develop following specific instructions coded for by their genes. these genes provide instructions that will direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a species young ([link]) will grow up to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its parents. even the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal functions, respond to stimuli, and cope with environmental stresses. two examples of internal functions regulated in an organism are nutrient transport and blood flow. organs (groups of tissues working together) perform specific functions, such as carrying oxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body. in order to function properly, cells need to have appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, ph, and appropriate concentration of diverse chemicals. these conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, through homeostasis (literally, steady state)the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions. for example, an organism needs to regulate body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation. organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear ([link]), have body structures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. structures that aid in this type of insulation include fur, feathers, blubber, and fat. in hot climates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat. all organisms use a source of energy for their metabolic activities. some organisms capture energy from the sun and convert it into chemical energy in food; others use chemical energy in molecules they take in as food ([link]). living things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy that can be examined on a scale from small to large. the atom is the smallest and most fundamental unit of matter. it consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. atoms form molecules. a molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by one or more chemical bonds. many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules, large molecules that are typically formed by polymerization (a polymer is a large molecule that is made by combining smaller units called monomers, which are simpler than macromolecules). an example of a macromolecule is deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) ([link]), which contains the instructions for the structure and functioning of all living organisms. some cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called organelles. organelles are small structures that exist within cells. examples of organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which carry out indispensable functions: mitochondria produce energy to power the cell, while chloroplasts enable green plants to utilize the energy in sunlight to make sugars. all living things are made of cells; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (this requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells. to make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack the reproductive mechanism of a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce.) some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. prokaryotes are single-celled or colonial organisms that do not have membrane-bound nuclei; in contrast, the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane-bound organelles and a membrane-bound nucleus. in larger organisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out similar or related functions. organs are collections of tissues grouped together performing a common function. organs are present not only in animals but also in plants. an organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. mammals have many organ systems. for instance, the circulatory system transports blood through the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. organisms are individual living entities. for example, each tree in a forest is an organism. single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as microorganisms. all the individuals of a species living within a specific area are collectively called a population. for example, a forest may include many pine trees. all of these pine trees represent the population of pine trees in this forest. different populations may live in the same specific area. for example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations. a community is the sum of populations inhabiting a particular area. for instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the forests community. the forest itself is an ecosystem. an ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, non-living parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rain water. at the highest level of organization ([link]), the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the zones of life on earth. it includes land, water, and even the atmosphere to a certain extent. the fact that biology, as a science, has such a broad scope has to do with the tremendous diversity of life on earth. the source of this diversity is evolution, the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species. evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems. the evolution of various life forms on earth can be summarized in a phylogenetic tree ([link]). a phylogenetic tree is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both. a phylogenetic tree is composed of nodes and branches. the internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when, based on scientific evidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new species. the length of each branch is proportional to the time elapsed since the split. carl woese and the phylogenetic treein the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. the organizational scheme was based mainly on physical features, as opposed to physiology, biochemistry, or molecular biology, all of which are used by modern systematics. the pioneering work of american microbiologist carl woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on earth has evolved along three lineages, now called domainsbacteria, archaea, and eukarya. the first two are prokaryotic cells with microbes that lack membrane-enclosed nuclei and organelles. the third domain contains the eukaryotes and includes unicellular microorganisms together with the four original kingdoms (excluding bacteria). woese defined archaea as a new domain, and this resulted in a new taxonomic tree ([link]). many organisms belonging to the archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. to construct his tree, woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape). woeses tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes that are universally distributed, present in every organism, and conserved (meaning that these genes have remained essentially unchanged throughout evolution). woeses approach was revolutionary because comparisons of physical features are insufficient to differentiate between the prokaryotes that appear fairly similar in spite of their tremendous biochemical diversity and genetic variability ([link]). the comparison of homologous dna and rna sequences provided woese with a sensitive device that revealed the extensive variability of prokaryotes, and which justified the separation of the prokaryotes into two domains: bacteria and archaea. the scope of biology is broad and therefore contains many branches and subdisciplines. biologists may pursue one of those subdisciplines and work in a more focused field. for instance, molecular biology and biochemistry study biological processes at the molecular and chemical level, including interactions among molecules such as dna, rna, and proteins, as well as the way they are regulated. microbiology, the study of microorganisms, is the study of the structure and function of single-celled organisms. it is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists, ecologists, and geneticists, among others. forensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law. biologists as well as chemists and biochemists can be forensic scientists. forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves examining trace materials associated with crimes. interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. also, the development of molecular techniques and the establishment of dna databases have expanded the types of work that forensic scientists can do. their job activities are primarily related to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault. their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing dna ([link]) found in many different environments and materials. forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect larvae or pollen grains. students who want to pursue careers in forensic science will most likely be required to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math courses. another field of biological study, neurobiology, studies the biology of the nervous system, and although it is considered a branch of biology, it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience. because of its interdisciplinary nature, this subdiscipline studies different functions of the nervous system using molecular, cellular, developmental, medical, and computational approaches. paleontology, another branch of biology, uses fossils to study lifes history ([link]). zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants, respectively. biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists, ecologists, or physiologists, to name just a few areas. this is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can pursue. biology is the culmination of the achievements of the natural sciences from their inception to today. excitingly, it is the cradle of emerging sciences, such as the biology of brain activity, genetic engineering of custom organisms, and the biology of evolution that uses the laboratory tools of molecular biology to retrace the earliest stages of life on earth. a scan of news headlineswhether reporting on immunizations, a newly discovered species, sports doping, or a genetically-modified fooddemonstrates the way biology is active in and important to our everyday world. biology is the science of life. all living organisms share several key properties such as order, sensitivity or response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, and energy processing. living things are highly organized parts of a hierarchy that includes atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. organisms, in turn, are grouped as populations, communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere. the great diversity of life today evolved from less-diverse ancestral organisms over billions of years. a diagram called a phylogenetic tree can be used to show evolutionary relationships among organisms. biology is very broad and includes many branches and subdisciplines. examples include molecular biology, microbiology, neurobiology, zoology, and botany, among others.","[('community', 'communities'), ('carl woese', 'carl woeses'), ('evolution', 'evolutions'), ('homeostasi', 'homeostases', 'homeostasis'), ('molecular biology', 'molecular biologies'),

3,stax-bio,2,The Chemical Foundation of Life,0,m44389,Introduction,"elements in various combinations comprise all matter, including living things. some of the most abundant elements in living organisms include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. these form the nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids that are the fundamental components of living matter. biologists must understand these important building blocks and the unique structures of the atoms that make up molecules, allowing for the formation of cells, tissues, organ systems, and entire organisms. all biological processes follow the laws of physics and chemistry, so in order to understand how biological systems work, it is important to understand the underlying physics and chemistry. for example, the flow of blood within the circulatory system follows the laws of physics that regulate the modes of fluid flow. the breakdown of the large, complex molecules of food into smaller moleculesand the conversion of these to release energy to be stored in adenosine triphosphate (atp)is a series of chemical reactions that follow chemical laws. the properties of water and the formation of hydrogen bonds are key to understanding living processes. recognizing the properties of acids and bases is important, for example, to our understanding of the digestive process.

4,stax-bio,2,The Chemical Foundation of Life,1,m44390,"Atoms, Isotopes, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks","at its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter. matter is any substance that occupies space and has mass. elements are unique forms of matter with specific chemical and physical properties that cannot be broken down into smaller substances by ordinary chemical reactions. there are 118 elements, but only 92 occur naturally. the remaining elements are synthesized in laboratories and are unstable. each element is designated by its chemical symbol, which is a single capital letter or, when the first letter is already taken by another element, a combination of two letters. some elements follow the english term for the element, such as c for carbon and ca for calcium. other elements chemical symbols derive from their latin names; for example, the symbol for sodium is na, referring to natrium, the latin word for sodium. the four elements common to all living organisms are oxygen (o), carbon (c), hydrogen (h), and nitrogen (n). in the non-living world, elements are found in different proportions, and some elements common to living organisms are relatively rare on the earth as a whole, as shown in [link]. for example, the atmosphere is rich in nitrogen and oxygen but contains little carbon and hydrogen, while the earths crust, although it contains oxygen and a small amount of hydrogen, has little nitrogen and carbon. in spite of their differences in abundance, all elements and the chemical reactions between them obey the same chemical and physical laws regardless of whether they are a part of the living or non-living world. to understand how elements come together, we must first discuss the smallest component or building block of an element, the atom. an atom is the smallest unit of matter that retains all of the chemical properties of an element. for example, one gold atom has all of the properties of gold in that it is a solid metal at room temperature. a gold coin is simply a very large number of gold atoms molded into the shape of a coin and containing small amounts of other elements known as impurities. gold atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of gold. an atom is composed of two regions: the nucleus, which is in the center of the atom and contains protons and neutrons, and the outermost region of the atom which holds its electrons in orbit around the nucleus, as illustrated in [link]. atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons, among other subatomic particles. the only exception is hydrogen (h), which is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons. protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass, about 1.67  10-24 grams. scientists arbitrarily define this amount of mass as one atomic mass unit (amu) or one dalton, as shown in [link]. although similar in mass, protons and neutrons differ in their electric charge. a proton is positively charged whereas a neutron is uncharged. therefore, the number of neutrons in an atom contributes significantly to its mass, but not to its charge. electrons are much smaller in mass than protons, weighing only 9.11  10-28 grams, or about 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit. hence, they do not contribute much to an elements overall atomic mass. therefore, when considering atomic mass, it is customary to ignore the mass of any electrons and calculate the atoms mass based on the number of protons and neutrons alone. although not significant contributors to mass, electrons do contribute greatly to the atoms charge, as each electron has a negative charge equal to the positive charge of a proton. in uncharged, neutral atoms, the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus is equal to the number of protons inside the nucleus. in these atoms, the positive and negative charges cancel each other out, leading to an atom with no net charge. accounting for the sizes of protons, neutrons, and electrons, most of the volume of an atomgreater than 99 percentis, in fact, empty space. with all this empty space, one might ask why so-called solid objects do not just pass through one another. the reason they do not is that the electrons that surround all atoms are negatively charged and negative charges repel each other. atoms of each element contain a characteristic number of protons and electrons. the number of protons determines an elements atomic number and is used to distinguish one element from another. the number of neutrons is variable, resulting in isotopes, which are different forms of the same atom that vary only in the number of neutrons they possess. together, the number of protons and the number of neutrons determine an elements mass number, as illustrated in [link]. note that the small contribution of mass from electrons is disregarded in calculating the mass number. this approximation of mass can be used to easily calculate how many neutrons an element has by simply subtracting the number of protons from the mass number. since an elements isotopes will have slightly different mass numbers, scientists also determine the atomic mass, which is the calculated mean of the mass number for its naturally occurring isotopes. often, the resulting number contains a fraction. for example, the atomic mass of chlorine (cl) is 35.45 because chlorine is composed of several isotopes, some (the majority) with atomic mass 35 (17 protons and 18 neutrons) and some with atomic mass 37 (17 protons and 20 neutrons). isotopes are different forms of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. some elementssuch as carbon, potassium, and uraniumhave naturally occurring isotopes. carbon-12 contains six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons; therefore, it has a mass number of 12 (six protons and six neutrons). carbon-14 contains six protons, eight neutrons, and six electrons; its atomic mass is 14 (six protons and eight neutrons). these two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes. some isotopes may emit neutrons, protons, and electrons, and attain a more stable atomic configuration (lower level of potential energy); these are radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes. radioactive decay (carbon-14 decaying to eventually become nitrogen-14) describes the energy loss that occurs when an unstable atoms nucleus releases radiation. carbon dating
carbon is normally present in the atmosphere in the form of gaseous compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. carbon-14 (14c) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere from atmospheric 14n (nitrogen) by the addition of a neutron and the loss of a proton because of cosmic rays. this is a continuous process, so more 14c is always being created. as a living organism incorporates 14c initially as carbon dioxide fixed in the process of photosynthesis, the relative amount of 14c in its body is equal to the concentration of 14c in the atmosphere. when an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting 14c, so the ratio between 14c and 12c will decline as 14c decays gradually to 14n by a process called beta decaythe emission of electrons or positrons. this decay gives off energy in a slow process. after approximately 5,730 years, half of the starting concentration of 14c will have been converted back to 14n. the time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay back to its more stable form is called its half-life. because the half-life of 14c is long, it is used to date formerly living objects such as old bones or wood. comparing the ratio of the 14c concentration found in an object to the amount of 14c detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined. on the basis of this amount, the age of the material, such as the pygmy mammoth shown in [link], can be calculated with accuracy if it is not much older than about 50,000 years. other elements have isotopes with different half lives. for example, 40k (potassium-40) has a half-life of 1.25 billion years, and 235u (uranium 235) has a half-life of about 700 million years. through the use of radiometric dating, scientists can study the age of fossils or other remains of extinct organisms to understand how organisms have evolved from earlier species. to learn more about atoms, isotopes, and how to tell one isotope from another, run the simulation.
 the different elements are organized and displayed in the periodic table. devised by russian chemist dmitri mendeleev (18341907) in 1869, the table groups elements that, although unique, share certain chemical properties with other elements. the properties of elements are responsible for their physical state at room temperature: they may be gases, solids, or liquids. elements also have specific chemical reactivity, the ability to combine and to chemically bond with each other. in the periodic table, shown in [link], the elements are organized and displayed according to their atomic number and are arranged in a series of rows and columns based on shared chemical and physical properties. in addition to providing the atomic number for each element, the periodic table also displays the elements atomic mass. looking at carbon, for example, its symbol (c) and name appear, as well as its atomic number of six (in the upper left-hand corner) and its atomic mass of 12.11. the periodic table groups elements according to chemical properties. the differences in chemical reactivity between the elements are based on the number and spatial distribution of an atoms electrons. atoms that chemically react and bond to each other form molecules. molecules are simply two or more atoms chemically bonded together. logically, when two atoms chemically bond to form a molecule, their electrons, which form the outermost region of each atom, come together first as the atoms form a chemical bond. it should be stressed that there is a connection between the number of protons in an element, the atomic number that distinguishes one element from another, and the number of electrons it has. in all electrically neutral atoms, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons. thus, each element, at least when electrically neutral, has a characteristic number of electrons equal to its atomic number. an early model of the atom was developed in 1913 by danish scientist niels bohr (18851962). the bohr model shows the atom as a central nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with the electrons in circular orbitals at specific distances from the nucleus, as illustrated in [link]. these orbits form electron shells or energy levels, which are a way of visualizing the number of electrons in the outermost shells. these energy levels are designated by a number and the symbol n. for example, 1n represents the first energy level located closest to the nucleus. electrons fill orbitals in a consistent order: they first fill the orbitals closest to the nucleus, then they continue to fill orbitals of increasing energy further from the nucleus. if there are multiple orbitals of equal energy, they will be filled with one electron in each energy level before a second electron is added. the electrons of the outermost energy level determine the energetic stability of the atom and its tendency to form chemical bonds with other atoms to form molecules. under standard conditions, atoms fill the inner shells first, often resulting in a variable number of electrons in the outermost shell. the innermost shell has a maximum of two electrons but the next two electron shells can each have a maximum of eight electrons. this is known as the octet rule, which states, with the exception of the innermost shell, that atoms are more stable energetically when they have eight electrons in their valence shell, the outermost electron shell. examples of some neutral atoms and their electron configurations are shown in [link]. notice that in this [link], helium has a complete outer electron shell, with two electrons filling its first and only shell. similarly, neon has a complete outer 2n shell containing eight electrons. in contrast, chlorine and sodium have seven and one in their outer shells, respectively, but theoretically they would be more energetically stable if they followed the octet rule and had eight. understanding that the organization of the periodic table is based on the total number of protons (and electrons) helps us know how electrons are distributed among the outer shell. the periodic table is arranged in columns and rows based on the number of electrons and where these electrons are located. take a closer look at the some of the elements in the tables far right column in [link]. the group 18 atoms helium (he), neon (ne), and argon (ar) all have filled outer electron shells, making it unnecessary for them to share electrons with other atoms to attain stability; they are highly stable as single atoms. their non-reactivity has resulted in their being named the inert gases (or noble gases). compare this to the group 1 elements in the left-hand column. these elements, including hydrogen (h), lithium (li), and sodium (na), all have one electron in their outermost shells. that means that they can achieve a stable configuration and a filled outer shell by donating or sharing one electron with another atom or a molecule such as water. hydrogen will donate or share its electron to achieve this configuration, while lithium and sodium will donate their electron to become stable. as a result of losing a negatively charged electron, they become positively charged ions. group 17 elements, including fluorine and chlorine, have seven electrons in their outmost shells, so they tend to fill this shell with an electron from other atoms or molecules, making them negatively charged ions. group 14 elements, of which carbon is the most important to living systems, have four electrons in their outer shell allowing them to make several covalent bonds (discussed below) with other atoms. thus, the columns of the periodic table represent the potential shared state of these elements outer electron shells that is responsible for their similar chemical characteristics. although useful to explain the reactivity and chemical bonding of certain elements, the bohr model of the atom does not accurately reflect how electrons are spatially distributed surrounding the nucleus. they do not circle the nucleus like the earth orbits the sun, but are found in electron orbitals. these relatively complex shapes result from the fact that electrons behave not just like particles, but also like waves. mathematical equations from quantum mechanics known as wave functions can predict within a certain level of probability where an electron might be at any given time. the area where an electron is most likely to be found is called its orbital. recall that the bohr model depicts an atoms electron shell configuration. within each electron shell are subshells, and each subshell has a specified number of orbitals containing electrons. while it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located, scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path. subshells are designated by the letter s, p, d, and f. the s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital. principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital, which can hold two electrons. principal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell, and can hold a total of eight electrons. the p subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals, as illustrated in [link]. subshells d and f have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals, respectively. these are not shown in the illustration. principal shell 3n has s, p, and d subshells and can hold 18 electrons. principal shell 4n has s, p, d and f orbitals and can hold 32 electrons.  moving away from the nucleus, the number of electrons and orbitals found in the energy levels increases. progressing from one atom to the next in the periodic table, the electron structure can be worked out by fitting an extra electron into the next available orbital. the closest orbital to the nucleus, called the 1s orbital, can hold up to two electrons. this orbital is equivalent to the innermost electron shell of the bohr model of the atom. it is called the 1s orbital because it is spherical around the nucleus. the 1s orbital is the closest orbital to the nucleus, and it is always filled first, before any other orbital can be filled. hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot within the 1s orbital occupied. this is designated as 1s1, where the superscripted 1 refers to the one electron within the 1s orbital. helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the 1s orbital with its two electrons. this is designated as 1s2, referring to the two electrons of helium in the 1s orbital. on the periodic table [link], hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row (period); this is because they only have electrons in their first shell, the 1s orbital. hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the 1s and no other electron orbitals in the electrically neutral state. the second electron shell may contain eight electrons. this shell contains another spherical s orbital and three dumbbell shaped p orbitals, each of which can hold two electrons, as shown in [link]. after the 1s orbital is filled, the second electron shell is filled, first filling its 2s orbital and then its three p orbitals. when filling the p orbitals, each takes a single electron; once each p orbital has an electron, a second may be added. lithium (li) contains three electrons that occupy the first and second shells. two electrons fill the 1s orbital, and the third electron then fills the 2s orbital. its electron configuration is 1s22s1. neon (ne), on the other hand, has a total of ten electrons: two are in its innermost 1s orbital and eight fill its second shell (two each in the 2s and three p orbitals); thus, it is an inert gas and energetically stable as a single atom that will rarely form a chemical bond with other atoms. larger elements have additional orbitals, making up the third electron shell. while the concepts of electron shells and orbitals are closely related, orbitals provide a more accurate depiction of the electron configuration of an atom because the orbital model specifies the different shapes and special orientations of all the places that electrons may occupy. watch this visual animation to see the spatial arrangement of the p and s orbitals.
 all elements are most stable when their outermost shell is filled with electrons according to the octet rule. this is because it is energetically favorable for atoms to be in that configuration and it makes them stable. however, since not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells, atoms form chemical bonds with other atoms thereby obtaining the electrons they need to attain a stable electron configuration. when two or more atoms chemically bond with each other, the resultant chemical structure is a molecule. the familiar water molecule, h2o, consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom; these bond together to form water, as illustrated in [link]. atoms can form molecules by donating, accepting, or sharing electrons to fill their outer shells. chemical reactions occur when two or more atoms bond together to form molecules or when bonded atoms are broken apart. the substances used in the beginning of a chemical reaction are called the reactants (usually found on the left side of a chemical equation), and the substances found at the end of the reaction are known as the products (usually found on the right side of a chemical equation). an arrow is typically drawn between the reactants and products to indicate the direction of the chemical reaction; this direction is not always a one-way street. for the creation of the water molecule shown above, the chemical equation would be: an example of a simple chemical reaction is the breaking down of hydrogen peroxide molecules, each of which consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to two oxygen atoms (h2o2). the reactant hydrogen peroxide is broken down into water, containing one oxygen atom bound to two hydrogen atoms (h2o), and oxygen, which consists of two bonded oxygen atoms (o2). in the equation below, the reaction includes two hydrogen peroxide molecules and two water molecules. this is an example of a balanced chemical equation, wherein the number of atoms of each element is the same on each side of the equation. according to the law of conservation of matter, the number of atoms before and after a chemical reaction should be equal, such that no atoms are, under normal circumstances, created or destroyed. even though all of the reactants and products of this reaction are molecules (each atom remains bonded to at least one other atom), in this reaction only hydrogen peroxide and water are representatives of compounds: they contain atoms of more than one type of element. molecular oxygen, on the other hand, as shown in [link],consists of two doubly bonded oxygen atoms and is not classified as a compound but as a mononuclear molecule. some chemical reactions, such as the one shown above, can proceed in one direction until the reactants are all used up. the equations that describe these reactions contain a unidirectional arrow and are irreversible. reversible reactions are those that can go in either direction. in reversible reactions, reactants are turned into products, but when the concentration of product goes beyond a certain threshold (characteristic of the particular reaction), some of these products will be converted back into reactants; at this point, the designations of products and reactants are reversed. this back and forth continues until a certain relative balance between reactants and products occursa state called equilibrium. these situations of reversible reactions are often denoted by a chemical equation with a double headed arrow pointing towards both the reactants and products. for example, in human blood, excess hydrogen ions (h+) bind to bicarbonate ions (hco3-) forming an equilibrium state with carbonic acid (h2co3). if carbonic acid were added to this system, some of it would be converted to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. in biological reactions, however, equilibrium is rarely obtained because the concentrations of the reactants or products or both are constantly changing, often with a product of one reaction being a reactant for another. to return to the example of excess hydrogen ions in the blood, the formation of carbonic acid will be the major direction of the reaction. however, the carbonic acid can also leave the body as carbon dioxide gas (via exhalation) instead of being converted back to bicarbonate ion, thus driving the reaction to the right by the chemical law known as law of mass action. these reactions are important for maintaining the homeostasis of our blood. some atoms are more stable when they gain or lose an electron (or possibly two) and form ions. this fills their outermost electron shell and makes them energetically more stable. because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. cations are positive ions that are formed by losing electrons. negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions. anions are designated by their elemental name being altered to end in -ide: the anion of chlorine is called chloride, and the anion of sulfur is called sulfide, for example.  this movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as electron transfer. as [link] illustrates, sodium (na)  only has one electron in its outer electron shell. it takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. if sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons, 11 neutrons, and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. it is now referred to as a sodium ion. chlorine (cl) in its lowest energy state (called the ground state) has seven electrons in its outer shell. again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven. therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons, 17 neutrons, and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (1) charge. it is now referred to as a chloride ion. in this example, sodium will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and chlorine will accept that electron to fill its shell. both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium cation) or 1 (chloride anion) charge. note that these transactions can normally only take place simultaneously: in order for a sodium atom to lose an electron, it must be in the presence of a suitable recipient like a chlorine atom. ionic bonds are formed between ions with opposite charges. for instance, positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions bond together to make crystals of sodium chloride, or table salt, creating a crystalline molecule with zero net charge. certain salts are referred to in physiology as electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, and calcium), ions necessary for nerve impulse conduction, muscle contractions and water balance. many sports drinks and dietary supplements provide these ions to replace those lost from the body via sweating during exercise. another way the octet rule can be satisfied is by the sharing of electrons between atoms to form covalent bonds. these bonds are stronger and much more common than ionic bonds in the molecules of living organisms. covalent bonds are commonly found in carbon-based organic molecules, such as our dna and proteins. covalent bonds are also found in inorganic molecules like h2o, co2, and o2. one, two, or three pairs of electrons may be shared, making single, double, and triple bonds, respectively. the more covalent bonds between two atoms, the stronger their connection. thus, triple bonds are the strongest. the strength of different levels of covalent bonding is one of the main reasons living organisms have a difficult time in acquiring nitrogen for use in constructing their molecules, even though molecular nitrogen, n2, is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere. molecular nitrogen consists of two nitrogen atoms triple bonded to each other and, as with all molecules, the sharing of these three pairs of electrons between the two nitrogen atoms allows for the filling of their outer electron shells, making the molecule more stable than the individual nitrogen atoms. this strong triple bond makes it difficult for living systems to break apart this nitrogen in order to use it as constituents of proteins and dna. the formation of water molecules provides an example of covalent bonding. the hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds, as shown in [link]. the electron from the hydrogen splits its time between the incomplete outer shell of the hydrogen atoms and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atoms. to completely fill the outer shell of oxygen, which has six electrons in its outer shell but which would be more stable with eight, two electrons (one from each hydrogen atom) are needed: hence the well-known formula h2o. the electrons are shared between the two elements to fill the outer shell of each, making both elements more stable. view this short video to see an animation of ionic and covalent bonding.
 there are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. in a polar covalent bond, shown in [link], the electrons are unequally shared by the atoms and are attracted more to one nucleus than the other. because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the atoms of different elements, a slightly positive (+) or slightly negative () charge develops. this partial charge is an important property of water and accounts for many of its characteristics. water is a polar molecule, with the hydrogen atoms acquiring a partial positive charge and the oxygen a partial negative charge. this occurs because the nucleus of the oxygen atom is more attractive to the electrons of the hydrogen atoms than the hydrogen nucleus is to the oxygens electrons. thus oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen and the shared electrons spend more time in the vicinity of the oxygen nucleus than they do near the nucleus of the hydrogen atoms, giving the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen slightly negative and positive charges, respectively. another way of stating this is that the probability of finding a shared electron near an oxygen nucleus is more likely than finding it near a hydrogen nucleus. either way, the atoms relative electronegativity contributes to the development of partial charges whenever one element is significantly more electronegative than the other, and the charges generated by these polar bonds may then be used for the formation of hydrogen bonds based on the attraction of opposite partial charges. (hydrogen bonds, which are discussed in detail below, are weak bonds between slightly positively charged hydrogen atoms to slightly negatively charged atoms in other molecules.) since macromolecules often have atoms within them that differ in electronegativity, polar bonds are often present in organic molecules. nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share electrons equally. for example, molecular oxygen (o2) is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between the two oxygen atoms. another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is methane (ch4), also shown in [link]. carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. it gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one, making a stable outer shell of eight electrons. carbon and hydrogen do not have the same electronegativity but are similar; thus, nonpolar bonds form. the hydrogen atoms each need one electron for their outermost shell, which is filled when it contains two electrons. these elements share the electrons equally among the carbons and the hydrogen atoms, creating a nonpolar covalent molecule. ionic and covalent bonds between elements require energy to break.  ionic bonds are not as strong as covalent, which determines their behavior in biological systems. however, not all bonds are ionic or covalent bonds. weaker bonds can also form between molecules. two weak bonds that occur frequently are hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions. without these two types of bonds, life as we know it would not exist. hydrogen bonds provide many of the critical, life-sustaining properties of water and also stabilize the structures of proteins and dna, the building block of cells. when polar covalent bonds containing hydrogen form, the hydrogen in that bond has a slightly positive charge because hydrogens electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen. because the hydrogen is slightly positive, it will be attracted to neighboring negative charges. when this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the +of the hydrogen from one molecule and the  charge on the more electronegative atoms of another molecule, usually oxygen or nitrogen, or within the same molecule. this interaction is called a hydrogen bond. this type of bond is common and occurs regularly between water molecules. individual hydrogen bonds are weak and easily broken; however, they occur in very large numbers in water and in organic polymers, creating a major force in combination. hydrogen bonds are also responsible for zipping together the dna double helix. like hydrogen bonds, van der waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. van der waals attractions can occur between any two or more molecules and are dependent on slight fluctuations of the electron densities, which are not always symmetrical around an atom. for these attractions to happen, the molecules need to be very close to one another. these bondsalong with ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bondscontribute to the three-dimensional structure of the proteins in our cells that is necessary for their proper function. pharmaceutical chemist
pharmaceutical chemists are responsible for the development of new drugs and trying to determine the mode of action of both old and new drugs. they are involved in every step of the drug development process. drugs can be found in the natural environment or can be synthesized in the laboratory. in many cases, potential drugs found in nature are changed chemically in the laboratory to make them safer and more effective, and sometimes synthetic versions of drugs substitute for the version found in nature. after the initial discovery or synthesis of a drug, the chemist then develops the drug, perhaps chemically altering it, testing it to see if the drug is toxic, and then designing methods for efficient large-scale production. then, the process of getting the drug approved for human use begins. in the united states, drug approval is handled by the food and drug administration (fda) and involves a series of large-scale experiments using human subjects to make sure the drug is not harmful and effectively treats the condition it aims to treat. this process often takes several years and requires the participation of physicians and scientists, in addition to chemists, to complete testing and gain approval. an example of a drug that was originally discovered in a living organism is paclitaxel (taxol), an anti-cancer drug used to treat breast cancer. this drug was discovered in the bark of the pacific yew tree. another example is aspirin, originally isolated from willow tree bark. finding drugs often means testing hundreds of samples of plants, fungi, and other forms of life to see if any biologically active compounds are found within them. sometimes, traditional medicine can give modern medicine clues to where an active compound can be found. for example, the use of willow bark to make medicine has been known for thousands of years, dating back to ancient egypt. it was not until the late 1800s, however, that the aspirin molecule, known as acetylsalicylic acid, was purified and marketed for human use. occasionally, drugs developed for one use are found to have unforeseen effects that allow these drugs to be used in other, unrelated ways. for example, the drug minoxidil (rogaine) was originally developed to treat high blood pressure. when tested on humans, it was noticed that individuals taking the drug would grow new hair. eventually the drug was marketed to men and women with baldness to restore lost hair. the career of the pharmaceutical chemist may involve detective work, experimentation, and drug development, all with the goal of making human beings healthier. matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. it is made up of elements. all of the 92 elements that occur naturally have unique qualities that allow them to combine in various ways to create molecules, which in turn combine to form cells, tissues, organ systems, and organisms. atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, are the smallest units of an element that retain all of the properties of that element. electrons can be transferred, shared, or cause charge disparities between atoms to create bonds, including ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds, as well as van der waals interactions.","[('electrolyte', 'electrolytess', 'electrolytes'), ('atomic mas', 'atomic masses', 'atomic mass'), ('van der waal interaction', 'van der waal

5,stax-bio,2,The Chemical Foundation of Life,2,m44392,Water,"why do scientists spend time looking for water on other planets? why is water so important? it is because water is essential to life as we know it. water is one of the more abundant molecules and the one most critical to life on earth. approximately 6070 percent of the human body is made up of water. without it, life as we know it simply would not exist. the polarity of the water molecule and its resulting hydrogen bonding make water a unique substance with special properties that are intimately tied to the processes of life. life originally evolved in a watery environment, and most of an organisms cellular chemistry and metabolism occur inside the watery contents of the cells cytoplasm. special properties of water are its high heat capacity and heat of vaporization, its ability to dissolve polar molecules, its cohesive and adhesive properties, and its dissociation into ions that leads to the generation of ph. understanding these characteristics of water helps to elucidate its importance in maintaining life. one of waters important properties is that it is composed of polar molecules: the hydrogen and oxygen within water molecules (h2o) form polar covalent bonds. while there is no net charge to a water molecule, the polarity of water creates a slightly positive charge on hydrogen and a slightly negative charge on oxygen, contributing to waters properties of attraction. waters charges are generated because oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, making it more likely that a shared electron would be found near the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nucleus, thus generating the partial negative charge near the oxygen. as a result of waters polarity, each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the opposite charges between water molecules, forming hydrogen bonds. water also attracts or is attracted to other polar molecules and ions. a polar substance that interacts readily with or dissolves in water is referred to as hydrophilic (hydro- = water; -philic = loving). in contrast, non-polar molecules such as oils and fats do not interact well with water, as shown in [link] and separate from it rather than dissolve in it, as we see in salad dressings containing oil and vinegar (an acidic water solution). these nonpolar compounds are called hydrophobic (hydro- = water; -phobic = fearing). the formation of hydrogen bonds is an important quality of the liquid water that is crucial to life as we know it. as water molecules make hydrogen bonds with each other, water takes on some unique chemical characteristics compared to other liquids and, since living things have a high water content, understanding these chemical features is key to understanding life. in liquid water, hydrogen bonds are constantly formed and broken as the water molecules slide past each other. the breaking of these bonds is caused by the motion (kinetic energy) of the water molecules due to the heat contained in the system. when the heat is raised as water is boiled, the higher kinetic energy of the water molecules causes the hydrogen bonds to break completely and allows water molecules to escape into the air as gas (steam or water vapor). on the other hand, when the temperature of water is reduced and water freezes, the water molecules form a crystalline structure maintained by hydrogen bonding (there is not enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds) that makes ice less dense than liquid water, a phenomenon not seen in the solidification of other liquids. waters lower density in its solid form is due to the way hydrogen bonds are oriented as it freezes: the water molecules are pushed farther apart compared to liquid water. with most other liquids, solidification when the temperature drops includes the lowering of kinetic energy between molecules, allowing them to pack even more tightly than in liquid form and giving the solid a greater density than the liquid. the lower density of ice, illustrated and pictured in [link], an anomaly, causes it to float at the surface of liquid water, such as in an iceberg or in the ice cubes in a glass of ice water. in lakes and ponds, ice will form on the surface of the water creating an insulating barrier that protects the animals and plant life in the pond from freezing. without this layer of insulating ice, plants and animals living in the pond would freeze in the solid block of ice and could not survive. the detrimental effect of freezing on living organisms is caused by the expansion of ice relative to liquid water. the ice crystals that form upon freezing rupture the delicate membranes essential for the function of living cells, irreversibly damaging them. cells can only survive freezing if the water in them is temporarily replaced by another liquid like glycerol. waters high heat capacity is a property caused by hydrogen bonding among water molecules. water has the highest specific heat capacity of any liquids. specific heat is defined as the amount of heat one gram of a substance must absorb or lose to change its temperature by one degree celsius. for water, this amount is one calorie. it therefore takes water a long time to heat and long time to cool. in fact, the specific heat capacity of water is about five times more than that of sand. this explains why the land cools faster than the sea. due to its high heat capacity, water is used by warm blooded animals to more evenly disperse heat in their bodies: it acts in a similar manner to a cars cooling system, transporting heat from warm places to cool places, causing the body to maintain a more even temperature. water also has a high heat of vaporization, the amount of energy required to change one  gram of a liquid substance to a gas. a considerable amount of heat energy (586 cal) is required to accomplish this change in water. this process occurs on the surface of water. as liquid water heats up, hydrogen bonding makes it difficult to separate the liquid water molecules from each other, which is required for it to enter its gaseous phase (steam). as a result, water acts as a heat sink or heat reservoir and requires much more heat to boil than does a liquid such as ethanol (grain alcohol), whose hydrogen bonding with other ethanol molecules is weaker than waters hydrogen bonding. eventually, as water reaches its boiling point of 100 celsius (212 fahrenheit), the heat is able to break the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules, and the kinetic energy (motion) between the water molecules allows them to escape from the liquid as a gas. even when below its boiling point, waters individual molecules acquire enough energy from other water molecules such that some surface water molecules can escape and vaporize: this process is known as evaporation. the fact that hydrogen bonds need to be broken for water to evaporate means that a substantial amount of energy is used in the process. as the water evaporates, energy is taken up by the process, cooling the environment where the evaporation is taking place. in many living organisms, including in humans, the evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows the organism to cool so that homeostasis of body temperature can be maintained. since water is a polar molecule with slightly positive and slightly negative charges, ions and polar molecules can readily dissolve in it. therefore, water is referred to as a solvent, a substance capable of dissolving other polar molecules and ionic compounds. the charges associated with these molecules will form hydrogen bonds with water, surrounding the particle with water molecules. this is referred to as a sphere of hydration, or a hydration shell, as illustrated in [link] and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water. when ionic compounds are added to water, the individual ions react with the polar regions of the water molecules and their ionic bonds are disrupted in the process of dissociation. dissociation occurs when atoms or groups of atoms break off from molecules and form ions. consider table salt (nacl, or sodium chloride): when nacl crystals are added to water, the molecules of nacl dissociate into na+ and cl  ions, and spheres of hydration form around the ions, illustrated in [link]. the positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially negative charge of the water molecules oxygen. the negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the partially positive charge of the hydrogen on the water molecule. have you ever filled a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops? before it overflows, the water forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. this water can stay above the glass because of the property of cohesion. in cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together at the liquid-gas (water-air) interface, although there is no more room in the glass. cohesion allows for the development of surface tension, the capacity of a substance to withstand being ruptured when placed under tension or stress. this is also why water forms droplets when placed on a dry surface rather than being flattened out by gravity. when a small scrap of paper is placed onto the droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water droplet even though paper is denser (heavier) than the water. cohesion and surface tension keep the hydrogen bonds of water molecules intact and support the item floating on the top. its even possible to float a needle on top of a glass of water if it is placed gently without breaking the surface tension, as shown in [link]. these cohesive forces are related to waters property of adhesion, or the attraction between water molecules and other molecules. this attraction is sometimes stronger than waters cohesive forces, especially when the water is exposed to charged surfaces such as those found on the inside of thin glass tubes known as capillary tubes. adhesion is observed when water climbs up the tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the tube than in the middle. this is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it. this type of adhesion is called capillary action, and is illustrated in [link]. why are cohesive and adhesive forces important for life? cohesive and adhesive forces are important for the transport of water from the roots to the leaves in plants. these forces create a pull on the water column. this pull results from the tendency of water molecules being evaporated on the surface of the plant to stay connected to water molecules below them, and so they are pulled along. plants use this natural phenomenon to help transport water from their roots to their leaves. without these properties of water, plants would be unable to receive the water and the dissolved minerals they require. in another example, insects such as the water strider, shown in [link], use the surface tension of water to stay afloat on the surface layer of water and even mate there. the ph of a solution indicates its acidity or alkalinity. 
 hydrogen ions are spontaneously generated in pure water by the dissociation (ionization) of a small percentage of water molecules into equal numbers of hydrogen (h+) ions and hydroxide (oh-) ions. while the hydroxide ions are kept in solution by their hydrogen bonding with other water molecules, the hydrogen ions, consisting of naked protons, are immediately attracted to un-ionized water molecules, forming hydronium ions (h30+). still, by convention, scientists refer to hydrogen ions and their concentration as if they were free in this state in liquid water. the concentration of hydrogen ions dissociating from pure water is 1  10-7 moles h+ ions per liter of water. moles (mol) are a way to express the amount of a substance (which can be atoms, molecules, ions, etc), with one mole being equal to 6.02 x 1023 particles of the substance. therefore, 1 mole of water is equal to 6.02 x 1023 water molecules. the ph is calculated as the negative of the base 10 logarithm of this concentration. the log10 of 1  10-7 is -7.0, and the negative of this number (indicated by the p of ph) yields a ph of 7.0, which is also known as neutral ph. the ph inside of human cells and blood are examples of two areas of the body where near-neutral ph is maintained. non-neutral ph readings result from dissolving acids or bases in water. using the negative logarithm to generate positive integers, high concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low ph number, whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high ph. an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (h+) in a solution, usually by having one of its hydrogen atoms dissociate. a base provides either hydroxide ions (oh) or other negatively charged ions that combine with hydrogen ions, reducing their concentration in the solution and thereby raising the ph. in cases where the base releases hydroxide ions, these ions bind to free hydrogen ions, generating new water molecules. the stronger the acid, the more readily it donates h+. for example, hydrochloric acid (hcl) completely dissociates into hydrogen and chloride ions and is highly acidic, whereas the acids in tomato juice or vinegar do not completely dissociate and are considered weak acids. conversely, strong bases are those substances that readily donate oh or take up hydrogen ions. sodium hydroxide (naoh) and many household cleaners are highly alkaline and give up oh rapidly when placed in water, thereby raising the ph. an example of a weak basic solution is seawater, which has a ph near 8.0, close enough to neutral ph that marine organisms adapted to this saline environment are able to thrive in it. the ph scale is, as previously mentioned, an inverse logarithm and ranges from 0 to 14 ([link]). anything below 7.0 (ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. extremes in ph in either direction from 7.0 are usually considered inhospitable to life. the ph inside cells (6.8) and the ph in the blood (7.4) are both very close to neutral. however, the environment in the stomach is highly acidic, with a ph of 1 to 2. so how do the cells of the stomach survive in such an acidic environment? how do they homeostatically maintain the near neutral ph inside them? the answer is that they cannot do it and are constantly dying. new stomach cells are constantly produced to replace dead ones, which are digested by the stomach acids. it is estimated that the lining of the human stomach is completely replaced every seven to ten days. watch this video for a straightforward explanation of ph and its logarithmic scale.

 so how can organisms whose bodies require a near-neutral ph ingest acidic and basic substances (a human drinking orange juice, for example) and survive? buffers are the key. buffers readily absorb excess h+ or oh, keeping the ph of the body carefully maintained in the narrow range required for survival. maintaining a constant blood ph is critical to a persons well-being. the buffer maintaining the ph of human blood involves carbonic acid (h2co3), bicarbonate ion (hco3), and carbon dioxide (co2). when bicarbonate ions combine with free hydrogen ions and become carbonic acid, hydrogen ions are removed, moderating ph changes. similarly, as shown in [link], excess carbonic acid can be converted to carbon dioxide gas and exhaled through the lungs. this prevents too many free hydrogen ions from building up in the blood and dangerously reducing the bloods ph. likewise, if too much oh is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will combine with it to create bicarbonate, lowering the ph. without this buffer system, the bodys ph would fluctuate enough to put survival in jeopardy. other examples of buffers are antacids used to combat excess stomach acid. many of these over-the-counter medications work in the same way as blood buffers, usually with at least one ion capable of absorbing hydrogen and moderating ph, bringing relief to those that suffer heartburn after eating. the unique properties of water that contribute to this capacity to balance phas well as waters other characteristicsare essential to sustaining life on earth. water has many properties that are critical to maintaining life. it is a polar molecule, allowing for the formation of hydrogen bonds. hydrogen bonds allow ions and other polar molecules to dissolve in water. therefore, water is an excellent solvent. the hydrogen bonds between water molecules cause the water to have a high heat capacity, meaning it takes a lot of added heat to raise its temperature. as the temperature rises, the hydrogen bonds between water continually break and form anew. this allows for the overall temperature to remain stable, although energy is added to the system. water also exhibits a high heat of vaporization, which is key to how organisms cool themselves by the evaporation of sweat. waters cohesive forces allow for the property of surface tension, whereas its adhesive properties are seen as water rises inside capillary tubes. the ph value is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution and is one of many chemical characteristics that is highly regulated in living organisms through homeostasis. acids and bases can change ph values, but buffers tend to moderate the changes they cause. these properties of water are intimately connected to the biochemical and physical processes performed by living organisms, and life would be very different if these properties were altered, if it could exist at all.","[('carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer system', 'carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer systems', 'carbonic acid-bicarbonates buffer system', 'carbonic acid-bicarbonates buffer systems'), ('dissociation', 'dissociations'), ('specific heat capacity', 'specific heat capacities', 'specific heats capacity', 'specific heats capacities'), ('buffer', 'buffers'), ('neutral ph', 'neutral phs'), ('litmu paper', 'litmu papers'), ('adhesion', 'adhesions'), ('hydrogen bond', 'hydrogen bonds'), ('boiling point', 'boiling points'), ('ga', 'gas'), ('cohesion', 'cohesions'), ('ph scale', 'ph scales'), ('acid', 'acids'), ('evaporation', 'evaporations'), ('heat of vaporization of water', 'heat of vaporization of water', 'heat of vaporizations of water', 'heat of vaporizations of water', 'heats of vaporization of water', 'heats of vaporization of water', 'heats of vaporizations of water', 'heats of vaporizations of water'), ('capillary action', 'capillary actions'), ('sphere of hydration', 'sphere of hydration', 'spheres of hydration', 'spheres of hydration'), ('hydrophilic', 'hydrophilics'), ('polarity', 'polarities'), ('surface tension', 'surface tensions'), ('calorie', 'calories'), ('ice', 'ices'), ('solvent', 'solvents'), ('hydrophobic', 'hydrophobics'), ('liquid', 'liquids'), ('float', 'floats'), ('ph paper', 'ph papers'), ('solid', 'solids'), ('base', 'bases'), ('water', 'waters'), ('non-neutral ph', 'non-neutral phs'), ('temperature', 'temperatures')]"
6,stax-bio,2,The Chemical Foundation of Life,3,m44393,Carbon,"cells are made of many complex molecules called macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids (rna and dna), carbohydrates, and lipids. the macromolecules are a subset of organic molecules (any carbon-containing liquid, solid, or gas) that are especially important for life. the fundamental component for all of these macromolecules is carbon. the carbon atom has unique properties that allow it to form covalent bonds to as many as four different atoms, making this versatile element ideal to serve as the basic structural component, or backbone, of the macromolecules. individual carbon atoms have an incomplete outermost electron shell. with an atomic number of 6 (six electrons and six protons), the first two electrons fill the inner shell, leaving four in the second shell. therefore, carbon atoms can form up to four covalent bonds with other atoms to satisfy the octet rule. the methane molecule provides an example: it has the chemical formula ch4. each of its four hydrogen atoms forms a single covalent bond with the carbon atom by sharing a pair of electrons. this results in a filled outermost shell. hydrocarbons are organic molecules consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen, such as methane (ch4) described above. we often use hydrocarbons in our daily lives as fuelslike the propane in a gas grill or the butane in a lighter. the many covalent bonds between the atoms in hydrocarbons store a great amount of energy, which is released when these molecules are burned (oxidized). methane, an excellent fuel, is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule, with a central carbon atom bonded to four different hydrogen atoms, as illustrated in [link]. the geometry of the methane molecule, where the atoms reside in three dimensions, is determined by the shape of its electron orbitals. the carbons and the four hydrogen atoms form a shape known as a tetrahedron, with four triangular faces; for this reason, methane is described as having tetrahedral geometry. as the backbone of the large molecules of living things, hydrocarbons may exist as linear carbon chains, carbon rings, or combinations of both. furthermore, individual carbon-to-carbon bonds may be single, double, or triple covalent bonds, and each type of bond affects the geometry of the molecule in a specific way. this three-dimensional shape or conformation of the large molecules of life (macromolecules) is critical to how they function. hydrocarbon chains are formed by successive bonds between carbon atoms and may be branched or unbranched. furthermore, the overall geometry of the molecule is altered by the different geometries of single, double, and triple covalent bonds, illustrated in [link]. the hydrocarbons ethane, ethene, and ethyne serve as examples of how different carbon-to-carbon bonds affect the geometry of the molecule. the names of all three molecules start with the prefix eth-, which is the prefix for two carbon hydrocarbons. the suffixes -ane, -ene, and -yne refer to the presence of single, double, or triple carbon-carbon bonds, respectively. thus, propane, propene, and propyne follow the same pattern with three carbon molecules, butane, butane, and butyne for four carbon molecules, and so on. double and triple bonds change the geometry of the molecule: single bonds allow rotation along the axis of the bond, whereas double bonds lead to a planar configuration and triple bonds to a linear one. these geometries have a significant impact on the shape a particular molecule can assume. so far, the hydrocarbons we have discussed have been aliphatic hydrocarbons, which consist of linear chains of carbon atoms. another type of hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbons, consists of closed rings of carbon atoms. ring structures are found in hydrocarbons, sometimes with the presence of double bonds, which can be seen by comparing the structure of cyclohexane to benzene in [link]. examples of biological molecules that incorporate the benzene ring include some amino acids and cholesterol and its derivatives, including the hormones estrogen and testosterone. the benzene ring is also found in the herbicide 2,4-d. benzene is a natural component of crude oil and has been classified as a carcinogen. some hydrocarbons have both aliphatic and aromatic portions; beta-carotene is an example of such a hydrocarbon. the three-dimensional placement of atoms and chemical bonds within organic molecules is central to understanding their chemistry. molecules that share the same chemical formula but differ in the placement (structure) of their atoms and/or chemical bonds are known as isomers. structural isomers (like butane and isobutene shown in [link] a) differ in the placement of their covalent bonds: both molecules have four carbons and ten hydrogens (c4h10), but the different arrangement of the atoms within the molecules leads to differences in their chemical properties. for example, due to their different chemical properties, butane is suited for use as a fuel for cigarette lighters and torches, whereas isobutene is suited for use as a refrigerant and a propellant in spray cans. geometric isomers, on the other hand, have similar placements of their covalent bonds but differ in how these bonds are made to the surrounding atoms, especially in carbon-to-carbon double bonds. in the simple molecule butene (c4h8), the two methyl groups (ch3) can be on either side of the double covalent bond central to the molecule, as illustrated in [link] b. when the carbons are bound on the same side of the double bond, this is the cis configuration; if they are on opposite sides of the double bond, it is a trans configuration. in the trans configuration, the carbons form a more or less linear structure, whereas the carbons in the cis configuration make a bend (change in direction) of the carbon backbone. in triglycerides (fats and oils), long carbon chains known as fatty acids may contain double bonds, which can be in either the cis or trans configuration, illustrated in [link]. fats with at least one double bond between carbon atoms are unsaturated fats. when some of these bonds are in the cis configuration, the resulting bend in the carbon backbone of the chain means that triglyceride molecules cannot pack tightly, so they remain liquid (oil) at room temperature. on the other hand, triglycerides with trans double bonds (popularly called trans fats), have relatively linear fatty acids that are able to pack tightly together at room temperature and form solid fats. in the human diet, trans fats are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, so many food manufacturers have reduced or eliminated their use in recent years. in contrast to unsaturated fats, triglycerides without double bonds between carbon atoms are called saturated fats, meaning that they contain all the hydrogen atoms available. saturated fats are a solid at room temperature and usually of animal origin. enantiomers are molecules that share the same chemical structure and chemical bonds but differ in the three-dimensional placement of atoms so that they are mirror images. as shown in [link], an amino acid alanine example, the two structures are non-superimposable. in nature, only the l-forms of amino acids are used to make proteins. some d forms of amino acids are seen in the cell walls of bacteria, but never in their proteins. similarly, the d-form of glucose is the main product of photosynthesis and the l-form of the molecule is rarely seen in nature. functional groups are groups of atoms that occur within molecules and confer specific chemical properties to those molecules. they are found along the carbon backbone of macromolecules. this carbon backbone is formed by chains and/or rings of carbon atoms with the occasional substitution of an element such as nitrogen or oxygen. molecules with other elements in their carbon backbone are substituted hydrocarbons. the functional groups in a macromolecule are usually attached to the carbon backbone at one or several different places along its chain and/or ring structure. each of the four types of macromoleculesproteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acidshas its own characteristic set of functional groups that contributes greatly to its differing chemical properties and its function in living organisms. a functional group can participate in specific chemical reactions. some of the important functional groups in biological molecules are shown in [link]; they include: hydroxyl, methyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate, and sulfhydryl. these groups play an important role in the formation of molecules like dna, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. functional groups are usually classified as hydrophobic or hydrophilic depending on their charge or polarity characteristics. an example of a hydrophobic group is the non-polar methane molecule. among the hydrophilic functional groups is the carboxyl group found in amino acids, some amino acid side chains, and the fatty acids that form triglycerides and phospholipids. this carboxyl group ionizes to release hydrogen ions (h+) from the cooh group resulting in the negatively charged coo- group; this contributes to the hydrophilic nature of whatever molecule it is found on. other functional groups, such as the carbonyl group, have a partially negatively charged oxygen atom that may form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, again making the molecule more hydrophilic. hydrogen bonds between functional groups (within the same molecule or between different molecules) are important to the function of many macromolecules and help them to fold properly into and maintain the appropriate shape for functioning. hydrogen bonds are also involved in various recognition processes, such as dna complementary base pairing and the binding of an enzyme to its substrate, as illustrated in [link]. the unique properties of carbon make it a central part of biological molecules. carbon binds to oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen covalently to form the many molecules important for cellular function. carbon has four electrons in its outermost shell and can form four bonds. carbon and hydrogen can form hydrocarbon chains or rings. functional groups are groups of atoms that confer specific properties to hydrocarbon (or substituted hydrocarbon) chains or rings that define their overall chemical characteristics and function.","[('tetrahedral geometry', 'tetrahedral geometries'), ('organic molecule', 'organic molecules'), ('hydrocarbon', 'hydrocarbons'), ('enantiomer', 'enantiomerss', 'enantiomers'), ('structural isomer', 'structural isomerss', 'structural isomers'), ('isomer', 'isomerss', 'isomers'), ('functional group', 'functional groups'), ('carbon', 'carbons'), ('substituted hydrocarbon', 'substituted hydrocarbons'), ('triglyceride', 'triglycerides'), ('aromatic hydrocarbon', 'aromatic hydrocarbons'), ('hydrocarbon chain', 'hydrocarbon chains'), ('aliphatic hydrocarbon', 'aliphatic hydrocarbons'), ('tetrahedron', 'tetrahedrons'), ('geometric isomer', 'geometric isomers'), ('macromolecule', 'macromolecules')]"

8,stax-bio,3,Biological Macromolecules,1,m44397,Synthesis of Biological Macromolecules,"as youve learned, biological macromolecules are large molecules, necessary for life, that are built from smaller organic molecules. there are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids); each is an important cell component and performs a wide array of functions. combined, these molecules make up the majority of a cells dry mass (recall that water makes up the majority of its complete mass). biological macromolecules are organic, meaning they contain carbon. in addition, they may contain hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor elements. most macromolecules are made from single subunits, or building blocks, called monomers. the monomers combine with each other using covalent bonds to form larger molecules known as polymers. in doing so, monomers release water molecules as byproducts. this type of reaction is known as dehydration synthesis, which means to put together while losing water. in a dehydration synthesis reaction ([link]), the hydrogen of one monomer combines with the hydroxyl group of another monomer, releasing a molecule of water. at the same time, the monomers share electrons and form covalent bonds. as additional monomers join, this chain of repeating monomers forms a polymer. different types of monomers can combine in many configurations, giving rise to a diverse group of macromolecules. even one kind of monomer can combine in a variety of ways to form several different polymers: for example, glucose monomers are the constituents of starch, glycogen, and cellulose. polymers are broken down into monomers in a process known as hydrolysis, which means to split water, a reaction in which a water molecule is used during the breakdown ([link]). during these reactions, the polymer is broken into two components: one part gains a hydrogen atom (h+) and the other gains a hydroxyl molecule (oh) from a split water molecule. dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are catalyzed, or sped up, by specific enzymes; dehydration reactions involve the formation of new bonds, requiring energy, while hydrolysis reactions break bonds and release energy. these reactions are similar for most macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific for its class. for example, in our bodies, food is hydrolyzed, or broken down, into smaller molecules by catalytic enzymes in the digestive system. this allows for easy absorption of nutrients by cells in the intestine. each macromolecule is broken down by a specific enzyme. for instance, carbohydrates are broken down by amylase, sucrase, lactase, or maltase. proteins are broken down by the enzymes pepsin and peptidase, and by hydrochloric acid. lipids are broken down by lipases. breakdown of these macromolecules provides energy for cellular activities. proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and lipids are the four major classes of biological macromoleculeslarge molecules necessary for life that are built from smaller organic molecules. macromolecules are made up of single units known as monomers that are joined by covalent bonds to form larger polymers. the polymer is more than the sum of its parts: it acquires new characteristics, and leads to an osmotic pressure that is much lower than that formed by its ingredients; this is an important advantage in the maintenance of cellular osmotic conditions. a monomer joins with another monomer with the release of a water molecule, leading to the formation of a covalent bond. these types of reactions are known as dehydration or condensation reactions. when polymers are broken down into smaller units (monomers), a molecule of water is used for each bond broken by these reactions; such reactions are known as hydrolysis reactions. dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are similar for all macromolecules, but each monomer and polymer reaction is specific to its class. dehydration reactions typically require an investment of energy for new bond formation, while hydrolysis reactions typically release energy by breaking bonds.","[('hydrolysi reaction', 'hydrolysi reactions'), ('synthesi of biological macromolecule', 'synthesi of biological macromolecules', 'synthesi of biological macromolecules', 'synthesis of biological macromolecule', 'synthesis of biological macromolecules', 'synthesis of biological macromolecules'), ('monomer', 'monomers'), ('dehydration synthesi', 'dehydration syntheses', 'dehydration synthesis'), ('dehydration', 'dehydrations'), ('polymer', 'polymers'), ('biological macromolecule', 'biological macromoleculess', 'biological macromolecules'), ('condensation', 'condensations'), ('dehydration reaction', 'dehydration reactions'), ('hydrolysi', 'hydrolyses', 'hydrolysis'), ('biological molecule', 'biological moleculess', 'biological molecules'), ('biological macromolecule', 'biological macromolecules'), ('macromolecule synthesi', 'macromolecule syntheses', 'macromolecule synthesis'), ('condensation reaction', 'condensation reactions')]"
9,stax-bio,3,Biological Macromolecules,2,m44400,Carbohydrates,"most people are familiar with carbohydrates, one type of macromolecule, especially when it comes to what we eat. to lose weight, some individuals adhere to low-carb diets. athletes, in contrast, often carb-load before important competitions to ensure that they have enough energy to compete at a high level. carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our diet; grains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates. carbohydrates provide energy to the body, particularly through glucose, a simple sugar that is a component of starch and an ingredient in many staple foods. carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans, animals, and plants. carbohydrates can be represented by the stoichiometric formula (ch2o)n, where n is the number of carbons in the molecule. in other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. this formula also explains the origin of the term carbohydrate: the components are carbon (carbo) and the components of water (hence, hydrate). carbohydrates are classified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. monosaccharides (mono- = one; sacchar- = sweet) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. in monosaccharides, the number of carbons usually ranges from three to seven. most monosaccharide names end with the suffix -ose. if the sugar has an aldehyde group (the functional group with the structure r-cho), it is known as an aldose, and if it has a ketone group (the functional group with the structure rc(=o)r'), it is known as a ketose. depending on the number of carbons in the sugar, they also may be known as trioses (three carbons), pentoses (five carbons), and or hexoses (six carbons). see [link] for an illustration of the monosaccharides. the chemical formula for glucose is c6h12o6. in humans, glucose is an important source of energy. during cellular respiration, energy is released from glucose, and that energy is used to help make adenosine triphosphate (atp). plants synthesize glucose using carbon dioxide and water, and glucose in turn is used for energy requirements for the plant. excess glucose is often stored as starch that is catabolized (the breakdown of larger molecules by cells) by humans and other animals that feed on plants. galactose (part of lactose, or milk sugar) and fructose (found in sucrose, in fruit) are other common monosaccharides. although glucose, galactose, and fructose all have the same chemical formula (c6h12o6), they differ structurally and chemically (and are known as isomers) because of the different arrangement of functional groups around the asymmetric carbon; all of these monosaccharides have more than one asymmetric carbon ([link]). glucose, galactose, and fructose are isomeric monosaccharides (hexoses), meaning they have the same chemical formula but have slightly different structures. glucose and galactose are aldoses, and fructose is a ketose. monosaccharides can exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules; in aqueous solutions they are usually found in ring forms ([link]). glucose in a ring form can have two different arrangements of the hydroxyl group (oh) around the anomeric carbon (carbon 1 that becomes asymmetric in the process of ring formation). if the hydroxyl group is below carbon number 1 in the sugar, it is said to be in the alpha () position, and if it is above the plane, it is said to be in the beta () position. disaccharides (di- = two) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (also known as a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis). during this process, the hydroxyl group of one monosaccharide combines with the hydrogen of another monosaccharide, releasing a molecule of water and forming a covalent bond. a covalent bond formed between a carbohydrate molecule and another molecule (in this case, between two monosaccharides) is known as a glycosidic bond ([link]). glycosidic bonds (also called glycosidic linkages) can be of the alpha or the beta type. common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose ([link]). lactose is a disaccharide consisting of the monomers glucose and galactose. it is found naturally in milk. maltose, or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed by a dehydration reaction between two glucose molecules. the most common disaccharide is sucrose, or table sugar, which is composed of the monomers glucose and fructose. a long chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds is known as a polysaccharide (poly- = many). the chain may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides. the molecular weight may be 100,000 daltons or more depending on the number of monomers joined. starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are primary examples of polysaccharides. starch is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of a mixture of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers of glucose). plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose, beyond the plants immediate energy needs, is stored as starch in different plant parts, including roots and seeds. the starch in the seeds provides food for the embryo as it germinates and can also act as a source of food for humans and animals. the starch that is consumed by humans is broken down by enzymes, such as salivary amylases, into smaller molecules, such as maltose and glucose. the cells can then absorb the glucose. starch is made up of glucose monomers that are joined by  1-4 or  1-6 glycosidic bonds. the numbers 1-4 and 1-6 refer to the carbon number of the two residues that have joined to form the bond. as illustrated in [link], amylose is starch formed by unbranched chains of glucose monomers (only  1-4 linkages), whereas amylopectin is a branched polysaccharide ( 1-6 linkages at the branch points). glycogen is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates and is made up of monomers of glucose. glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells. whenever blood glucose levels decrease, glycogen is broken down to release glucose in a process known as glycogenolysis. cellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer. the cell wall of plants is mostly made of cellulose; this provides structural support to the cell. wood and paper are mostly cellulosic in nature. cellulose is made up of glucose monomers that are linked by  1-4 glycosidic bonds ([link]). as shown in [link], every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over, and the monomers are packed tightly as extended long chains. this gives cellulose its rigidity and high tensile strengthwhich is so important to plant cells. while the  1-4 linkage cannot be broken down by human digestive enzymes, herbivores such as cows, koalas, and buffalos are able, with the help of the specialized flora in their stomach, to digest plant material that is rich in cellulose and use it as a food source. in these animals, certain species of bacteria and protists reside in the rumen (part of the digestive system of herbivores) and secrete the enzyme cellulase. the appendix of grazing animals also contains bacteria that digest cellulose, giving it an important role in the digestive systems of ruminants. cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose monomers that can be used as an energy source by the animal. termites are also able to break down cellulose because of the presence of other organisms in their bodies that secrete cellulases. carbohydrates serve various functions in different animals. arthropods (insects, crustaceans, and others) have an outer skeleton, called the exoskeleton, which protects their internal body parts (as seen in the bee in [link]). this exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule chitin, which is a polysaccharide-containing nitrogen. it is made of repeating units of n-acetyl--d-glucosamine, a modified sugar. chitin is also a major component of fungal cell walls; fungi are neither animals nor plants and form a kingdom of their own in the domain eukarya. registered dietitianobesity is a worldwide health concern, and many diseases such as diabetes and heart disease are becoming more prevalent because of obesity. this is one of the reasons why registered dietitians are increasingly sought after for advice. registered dietitians help plan nutrition programs for individuals in various settings. they often work with patients in health care facilities, designing nutrition plans to treat and prevent diseases. for example, dietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to manage blood sugar levels by eating the correct types and amounts of carbohydrates. dietitians may also work in nursing homes, schools, and private practices. to become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelors degree in dietetics, nutrition, food technology, or a related field. in addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and pass a national exam. those who pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition, chemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, and human physiology. dietitians must become experts in the chemistry and physiology (biological functions) of food (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats). are carbohydrates good for you? people who wish to lose weight are often told that carbohydrates are bad for them and should be avoided. some diets completely forbid carbohydrate consumption, claiming that a low-carbohydrate diet helps people to lose weight faster. however, carbohydrates have been an important part of the human diet for thousands of years; artifacts from ancient civilizations show the presence of wheat, rice, and corn in our ancestors storage areas. carbohydrates should be supplemented with proteins, vitamins, and fats to be parts of a well-balanced diet. calorie-wise, a gram of carbohydrate provides 4.3 kcal. for comparison, fats provide 9 kcal/g, a less desirable ratio. carbohydrates contain soluble and insoluble elements; the insoluble part is known as fiber, which is mostly cellulose. fiber has many uses; it promotes regular bowel movement by adding bulk, and it regulates the rate of consumption of blood glucose. fiber also helps to remove excess cholesterol from the body: fiber binds to the cholesterol in the small intestine, then attaches to the cholesterol and prevents the cholesterol particles from entering the bloodstream, and then cholesterol exits the body via the feces. fiber-rich diets also have a protective role in reducing the occurrence of colon cancer. in addition, a meal containing whole grains and vegetables gives a feeling of fullness. as an immediate source of energy, glucose is broken down during the process of cellular respiration, which produces atp, the energy currency of the cell. without the consumption of carbohydrates, the availability of instant energy would be reduced. eliminating carbohydrates from the diet is not the best way to lose weight. a low-calorie diet that is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean meat, together with plenty of exercise and plenty of water, is the more sensible way to lose weight. carbohydrates are a group of macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell and provide structural support to plant cells, fungi, and all of the arthropods that include lobsters, crabs, shrimp, insects, and spiders. carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides depending on the number of monomers in the molecule. monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds that are formed as a result of dehydration reactions, forming disaccharides and polysaccharides with the elimination of a water molecule for each bond formed. glucose, galactose, and fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. starch and glycogen, examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals, respectively. the long polysaccharide chains may be branched or unbranched. cellulose is an example of an unbranched polysaccharide, whereas amylopectin, a constituent of starch, is a highly branched molecule. storage of glucose, in the form of polymers like starch of glycogen, makes it slightly less accessible for metabolism; however, this prevents it from leaking out of the cell or creating a high osmotic pressure that could cause excessive water uptake by the cell.","[('monosaccharide', 'monosaccharides'), ('disaccharide', 'disaccharides'), ('carbohydrate', 'carbohydratess', 'carbohydrates'), ('glycosidic bond', 'glycosidic bonds'), ('carbohydrate', 'carbohydrates'), ('molecular structure', 'molecular structures'), ('glycogen', 'glycogens'), ('biological macromolecule', 'biological macromoleculess', 'biological macromolecules'), ('carbohydrate classification', 'carbohydrate classifications'), ('polysaccharide', 'polysaccharides'), ('biological molecule', 'biological moleculess', 'biological molecules'), ('chitin', 'chitins'), ('cellulose', 'cellulose')]"
10,stax-bio,3,Biological Macromolecules,3,m44401,Lipids,"lipids include a diverse group of compounds that are largely nonpolar in nature. this is because they are hydrocarbons that include mostly nonpolar carboncarbon or carbonhydrogen bonds. non-polar molecules are hydrophobic (water fearing), or insoluble in water. lipids perform many different functions in a cell. cells store energy for long-term use in the form of fats. lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals ([link]). for example, they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry when forming a protective layer over fur or feathers because of their water-repellant hydrophobic nature. lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of all cellular membranes. lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. a fat molecule consists of two main componentsglycerol and fatty acids. glycerol is an organic compound (alcohol) with three carbons, five hydrogens, and three hydroxyl (oh) groups. fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which a carboxyl group is attached, hence the name fatty acid. the number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36; most common are those containing 1218 carbons. in a fat molecule, the fatty acids are attached to each of the three carbons of the glycerol molecule with an ester bond through an oxygen atom ([link]). during this ester bond formation, three water molecules are released. the three fatty acids in the triacylglycerol may be similar or dissimilar. fats are also called triacylglycerols or triglycerides because of their chemical structure. some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. for example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree. arachidic acid is derived from arachis hypogea, the scientific name for groundnuts or peanuts. fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. in a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is said to be saturated. saturated fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized. stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid ([link]) when the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is said to be unsaturated. oleic acid is an example of an unsaturated fatty acid ([link]). most unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are called oils. if there is one double bond in the molecule, then it is known as a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then it is known as a polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil). when a fatty acid has no double bonds, it is known as a saturated fatty acid because no more hydrogen may be added to the carbon atoms of the chain. a fat may contain similar or different fatty acids attached to glycerol. long straight fatty acids with single bonds tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic acid (common in meat) and the fat with butyric acid (common in butter) are examples of saturated fats. mammals store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cells volume. in plants, fat or oil is stored in many seeds and is used as a source of energy during seedling development. unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain cis unsaturated fatty acids. cis and trans indicate the configuration of the molecule around the double bond. if hydrogens are present in the same plane, it is referred to as a cis fat; if the hydrogen atoms are on two different planes, it is referred to as a trans fat. the cis double bond causes a bend or a kink that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature ([link]). olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats. unsaturated fats help to lower blood cholesterol levels whereas saturated fats contribute to plaque formation in the arteries. in the food industry, oils are artificially hydrogenated to make them semi-solid and of a consistency desirable for many processed food products. simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. during this hydrogenation process, double bonds of the cis- conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double bonds in the trans- conformation. margarine, some types of peanut butter, and shortening are examples of artificially hydrogenated trans fats. recent studies have shown that an increase in trans fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in levels of low-density lipoproteins (ldl), or bad cholesterol, which in turn may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. many fast food restaurants have recently banned the use of trans fats, and food labels are required to display the trans fat content. essential fatty acids are fatty acids required but not synthesized by the human body. consequently, they have to be supplemented through ingestion via the diet. omega-3 fatty acids (like that shown in [link]) fall into this category and are one of only two known for humans (the other being omega-6 fatty acid). these are polyunsaturated fatty acids and are called omega-3 because the third carbon from the end of the hydrocarbon chain is connected to its neighboring carbon by a double bond. the farthest carbon away from the carboxyl group is numbered as the omega () carbon, and if the double bond is between the third and fourth carbon from that end, it is known as an omega-3 fatty acid. nutritionally important because the body does not make them, omega-3 fatty acids include alpha-linoleic acid (ala), eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), and docosahexaenoic acid (dha), all of which are polyunsaturated. salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. research indicates that omega-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of sudden death from heart attacks, reduce triglycerides in the blood, lower blood pressure, and prevent thrombosis by inhibiting blood clotting. they also reduce inflammation, and may help reduce the risk of some cancers in animals. like carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity. it is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other fatty foods leads to weight gain. however, fats do have important functions. many vitamins are fat soluble, and fats serve as a long-term storage form of fatty acids: a source of energy. they also provide insulation for the body. therefore, healthy fats in moderate amounts should be consumed on a regular basis. wax covers the feathers of some aquatic birds and the leaf surfaces of some plants. because of the hydrophobic nature of waxes, they prevent water from sticking on the surface ([link]). waxes are made up of long fatty acid chains esterified to long-chain alcohols. phospholipids are major constituents of the plasma membrane, the outermost layer of animal cells. like fats, they are composed of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or sphingosine backbone. instead of three fatty acids attached as in triglycerides, however, there are two fatty acids forming diacylglycerol, and the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is occupied by a modified phosphate group ([link]). a phosphate group alone attached to a diaglycerol does not qualify as a phospholipid; it is phosphatidate (diacylglycerol 3-phosphate), the precursor of phospholipids. the phosphate group is modified by an alcohol. phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine are two important phospholipids that are found in plasma membranes. a phospholipid is an amphipathic molecule, meaning it has a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic part. the fatty acid chains are hydrophobic and cannot interact with water, whereas the phosphate-containing group is hydrophilic and interacts with water ([link]). the head is the hydrophilic part, and the tail contains the hydrophobic fatty acids. in a membrane, a bilayer of phospholipids forms the matrix of the structure, the fatty acid tails of phospholipids face inside, away from water, whereas the phosphate group faces the outside, aqueous side ([link]). phospholipids are responsible for the dynamic nature of the plasma membrane. if a drop of phospholipids is placed in water, it spontaneously forms a structure known as a micelle, where the hydrophilic phosphate heads face the outside and the fatty acids face the interior of this structure. unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier, steroids have a fused ring structure. although they do not resemble the other lipids, they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobicand insoluble in water. all steroids have four linked carbon rings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail ([link]). many steroids also have the oh functional group, which puts them in the alcohol classification (sterols). cholesterol is the most common steroid. cholesterol is mainly synthesized in the liver and is the precursor to many steroid hormones such as testosterone and estradiol, which are secreted by the gonads and endocrine glands. it is also the precursor to vitamin d. cholesterol is also the precursor of bile salts, which help in the emulsification of fats and their subsequent absorption by cells. although cholesterol is often spoken of in negative terms by lay people, it is necessary for proper functioning of the body. it is a component of the plasma membrane of animal cells and is found within the phospholipid bilayer. being the outermost structure in animal cells, the plasma membrane is responsible for the transport of materials and cellular recognition and it is involved in cell-to-cell communication. lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature. major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. fats are a stored form of energy and are also known as triacylglycerols or triglycerides. fats are made up of fatty acids and either glycerol or sphingosine. fatty acids may be unsaturated or saturated, depending on the presence or absence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. if only single bonds are present, they are known as saturated fatty acids. unsaturated fatty acids may have one or more double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain. phospholipids make up the matrix of membranes. they have a glycerol or sphingosine backbone to which two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group are attached. steroids are another class of lipids. their basic structure has four fused carbon rings. cholesterol is a type of steroid and is an important constituent of the plasma membrane, where it helps to maintain the fluid nature of the membrane. it is also the precursor of steroid hormones such as testosterone.","[('phospholipid', 'phospholipids'), ('triglyceride', 'triglycerides'), ('lipid', 'lipids'), ('fat', 'fats'), ('saturated fatty acid', 'saturated fatty acids'), ('triacylglycerol', 'triacylglycerols'), ('oil', 'oils'), ('wax', 'waxes'), ('saturated fat', 'saturated fats'), ('tran fat', 'tran fats'), ('unsaturated fatty acid', 'unsaturated fatty acids'), ('omega-3', 'omega-3s'), ('biological macromolecule', 'biological macromoleculess', 'biological macromolecules'), ('fatty acid', 'fatty acids'), ('lipid', 'lipidss', 'lipids'), ('omega-6', 'omega-6s'), ('steroid', 'steroids'), ('biological molecule', 'biological moleculess', 'biological molecules'), ('omega fat', 'omega fats'), ('unsaturated fat', 'unsaturated fats'), ('energy from fat', 'energy from fat', 'energies from fat', 'energies from fat')]"
11,stax-bio,3,Biological Macromolecules,4,m44402,Proteins,"proteins are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of functions of all macromolecules. proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. each cell in a living system may contain thousands of proteins, each with a unique function. their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. they are all, however, polymers of amino acids, arranged in a linear sequence. enzymes, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually complex or conjugated proteins. each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) it acts on. the enzyme may help in breakdown, rearrangement, or synthesis reactions. enzymes that break down their substrates are called catabolic enzymes, enzymes that build more complex molecules from their substrates are called anabolic enzymes, and enzymes that affect the rate of reaction are called catalytic enzymes. it should be noted that all enzymes increase the rate of reaction and, therefore, are considered to be organic catalysts. an example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which hydrolyzes its substrate amylose, a component of starch. hormones are chemical-signaling molecules, usually small proteins or steroids, secreted by endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. for example, insulin is a protein hormone that helps to regulate the blood glucose level. the primary types and functions of proteins are listed in [link]. proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous in nature. for example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. protein shape is critical to its function, and this shape is maintained by many different types of chemical bonds. changes in temperature, ph, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to loss of function, known as denaturation. all proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 types of amino acids. amino acids are the monomers that make up proteins. each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which consists of a central carbon atom, also known as the alpha () carbon, bonded to an amino group (nh2), a carboxyl group (cooh), and to a hydrogen atom. every amino acid also has another atom or group of atoms bonded to the central atom known as the r group ([link]). the name ""amino acid"" is derived from the fact that they contain both amino group and carboxyl-acid-group in their basic structure. as mentioned, there are 20 amino acids present in proteins. ten of these are considered essential amino acids in humans because the human body cannot produce them and they are obtained from the diet. for each amino acid, the r group (or side chain) is different ([link]). there are 20 common amino acids commonly found in proteins, each with a different r group (variant group) that determines its chemical nature.


 which categories of amino acid would you expect to find on the surface of a soluble protein, and which would you expect to find in the interior? what distribution of amino acids would you expect to find in a protein embedded in a lipid bilayer? the chemical nature of the side chain determines the nature of the amino acid (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar). for example, the amino acid glycine has a hydrogen atom as the r group. amino acids such as valine, methionine, and alanine are nonpolar or hydrophobic in nature, while amino acids such as serine, threonine, and cysteine are polar and have hydrophilic side chains. the side chains of lysine and arginine are positively charged, and therefore these amino acids are also known as basic amino acids. proline has an r group that is linked to the amino group, forming a ring-like structure. proline is an exception to the standard structure of an animo acid since its amino group is not separate from the side chain ([link]). amino acids are represented by a single upper case letter or a three-letter abbreviation. for example, valine is known by the letter v or the three-letter symbol val. just as some fatty acids are essential to a diet, some amino acids are necessary as well. they are known as essential amino acids, and in humans they include isoleucine, leucine, and cysteine. essential amino acids refer to those necessary for construction of proteins in the body, although not produced by the body; which amino acids are essential varies from organism to organism. the sequence and the number of amino acids ultimately determine the protein's shape, size, and function. each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is formed by a dehydration reaction. the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the incoming amino acid combine, releasing a molecule of water. the resulting bond is the peptide bond ([link]). the products formed by such linkages are called peptides. as more amino acids join to this growing chain, the resulting chain is known as a polypeptide. each polypeptide has a free amino group at one end. this end is called the n terminal, or the amino terminal, and the other end has a free carboxyl group, also known as the c or carboxyl terminal. while the terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used interchangeably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together, often have bound non-peptide prosthetic groups, have a distinct shape, and have a unique function. after protein synthesis (translation), most proteins are modified. these are known as post-translational modifications. they may undergo cleavage, phosphorylation, or may require the addition of other chemical groups. only after these modifications is the protein completely functional. the evolutionary significance of cytochrome ccytochrome c is an important component of the electron transport chain, a part of cellular respiration, and it is normally found in the cellular organelle, the mitochondrion. this protein has a heme prosthetic group, and the central ion of the heme gets alternately reduced and oxidized during electron transfer. because this essential proteins role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years. protein sequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of cytochrome c amino acid sequence homology among different species; in other words, evolutionary kinship can be assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among various species dna or protein sequences. scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids. for each cytochrome c molecule from different organisms that has been sequenced to date, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same position in all samples of cytochrome c. this indicates that there may have been a common ancestor. on comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. when human and rhesus monkey sequences were compared, the single difference found was in one amino acid. in another comparison, human to yeast sequencing shows a difference in the 44th position. as discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. for example, an enzyme can bind to a specific substrate at a site known as the active site. if this active site is altered because of local changes or changes in overall protein structure, the enzyme may be unable to bind to the substrate. to understand how the protein gets its final shape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. the unique sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. for example, the pancreatic hormone insulin has two polypeptide chains, a and b, and they are linked together by disulfide bonds. the n terminal amino acid of the a chain is glycine, whereas the c terminal amino acid is asparagine ([link]). the sequences of amino acids in the a and b chains are unique to insulin. the unique sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene encoding the protein. a change in nucleotide sequence of the genes coding region may lead to a different amino acid being added to the growing polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein structure and function. in sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin  chain (a small portion of which is shown in [link]) has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in protein structure and function. specifically, the amino acid glutamic acid is substituted by valine in the  chain. what is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. the molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. the structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell moleculewhich dramatically decreases life expectancyis a single amino acid of the 600. what is even more remarkable is that those 600 amino acids are encoded by three nucleotides each, and the mutation is caused by a single base change (point mutation), 1 in 1800 bases. because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, hemoglobin molecules form long fibers that distort the biconcave, or disc-shaped, red blood cells and assume a crescent or sickle shape, which clogs arteries ([link]). this can lead to myriad serious health problems such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those affected by this disease. the local folding of the polypeptide in some regions gives rise to the secondary structure of the protein. the most common are the -helix and -pleated sheet structures ([link]). both structures are the -helix structurethe helix held in shape by hydrogen bonds. the hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group in one amino acid and another amino acid that is four amino acids farther along the chain. every helical turn in an alpha helix has 3.6 amino acid residues. the r groups (the variant groups) of the polypeptide protrude out from the -helix chain. in the -pleated sheet, the pleats are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the polypeptide chain. the r groups are attached to the carbons and extend above and below the folds of the pleat. the pleated segments align parallel or antiparallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the partially positive nitrogen atom in the amino group and the partially negative oxygen atom in the carbonyl group of the peptide backbone. the -helix and -pleated sheet structures are found in most globular and fibrous proteins and they play an important structural role. the unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is its tertiary structure ([link]). this structure is in part due to chemical interactions at work on the polypeptide chain. primarily, the interactions among r groups creates the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. the nature of the r groups found in the amino acids involved can counteract the formation of the hydrogen bonds described for standard secondary structures. for example, r groups with like charges are repelled by each other and those with unlike charges are attracted to each other (ionic bonds). when protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic r groups of nonpolar amino acids lay in the interior of the protein, whereas the hydrophilic r groups lay on the outside. the former types of interactions are also known as hydrophobic interactions. interaction between cysteine side chains forms disulfide linkages in the presence of oxygen, the only covalent bond forming during protein folding. all of these interactions, weak and strong, determine the final three-dimensional shape of the protein. when a protein loses its three-dimensional shape, it may no longer be functional. in nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure. weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure. for example, insulin (a globular protein) has a combination of hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds that cause it to be mostly clumped into a ball shape. insulin starts out as a single polypeptide and loses some internal sequences in the presence of post-translational modification after the formation of the disulfide linkages that hold the remaining chains together. silk (a fibrous protein), however, has a -pleated sheet structure that is the result of hydrogen bonding between different chains. the four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) are illustrated in [link]. each protein has its own unique sequence and shape that are held together by chemical interactions. if the protein is subject to changes in temperature, ph, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation. denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function. one example of irreversible protein denaturation is when an egg is fried. the albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan. not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at temperatures close to boiling. the stomach is also very acidic, has a low ph, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process; however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these conditions. protein folding is critical to its function. it was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process. only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process. they act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded. proteins are a class of macromolecules that perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. they help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers, or hormones. the building blocks of proteins (monomers) are amino acids. each amino acid has a central carbon that is linked to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and an r group or side chain. there are 20 commonly occurring amino acids, each of which differs in the r group. each amino acid is linked to its neighbors by a peptide bond. a long chain of amino acids is known as a polypeptide. proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and (optional) quaternary. the primary structure is the unique sequence of amino acids. the local folding of the polypeptide to form structures such as the  helix and -pleated sheet constitutes the secondary structure. the overall three-dimensional structure is the tertiary structure. when two or more polypeptides combine to form the complete protein structure, the configuration is known as the quaternary structure of a protein. protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature or ph may lead to protein denaturation and a loss in function.","[('amino acid', 'amino acids'), ('protein folding', 'protein foldings'), ('cytochrome c',

12,stax-bio,3,Biological Macromolecules,5,m44403,Nucleic Acids,"nucleic acids are the most important macromolecules for the continuity of life. they carry the genetic blueprint of a cell and carry instructions for the functioning of the cell. the two main types of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) and ribonucleic acid (rna). dna is the genetic material found in all living organisms, ranging from single-celled bacteria to multicellular mammals. it is found in the nucleus of eukaryotes and in the organelles, chloroplasts, and mitochondria. in prokaryotes, the dna is not enclosed in a membranous envelope. the entire genetic content of a cell is known as its genome, and the study of genomes is genomics. in eukaryotic cells but not in prokaryotes, dna forms a complex with histone proteins to form chromatin, the substance of eukaryotic chromosomes. a chromosome may contain tens of thousands of genes. many genes contain the information to make protein products; other genes code for rna products. dna controls all of the cellular activities by turning the genes on or off. the other type of nucleic acid, rna, is mostly involved in protein synthesis. the dna molecules never leave the nucleus but instead use an intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. this intermediary is the messenger rna (mrna). other types of rnalike rrna, trna, and micrornaare involved in protein synthesis and its regulation. dna and rna are made up of monomers known as nucleotides. the nucleotides combine with each other to form a polynucleotide, dna or rna. each nucleotide is made up of three components: a nitrogenous base, a pentose (five-carbon) sugar, and a phosphate group ([link]). each nitrogenous base in a nucleotide is attached to a sugar molecule, which is attached to one or more phosphate groups. the nitrogenous bases, important components of nucleotides, are organic molecules and are so named because they contain carbon and nitrogen. they are bases because they contain an amino group that has the potential of binding an extra hydrogen, and thus, decreases the hydrogen ion concentration in its environment, making it more basic. each nucleotide in dna contains one of four possible nitrogenous bases: adenine (a), guanine (g) cytosine (c), and thymine (t). adenine and guanine are classified as purines. the primary structure of a purine is two carbon-nitrogen rings. cytosine, thymine, and uracil are classified as pyrimidines which have a single carbon-nitrogen ring as their primary structure ([link]). each of these basic carbon-nitrogen rings has different functional groups attached to it. in molecular biology shorthand, the nitrogenous bases are simply known by their symbols a, t, g, c, and u. dna contains a, t, g, and c whereas rna contains a, u, g, and c. the pentose sugar in dna is deoxyribose, and in rna, the sugar is ribose ([link]). the difference between the sugars is the presence of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon of the ribose and hydrogen on the second carbon of the deoxyribose. the carbon atoms of the sugar molecule are numbered as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (1 is read as one prime). the phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5 carbon of one sugar and the hydroxyl group of the 3 carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, which forms a 53 phosphodiester linkage. the phosphodiester linkage is not formed by simple dehydration reaction like the other linkages connecting monomers in macromolecules: its formation involves the removal of two phosphate groups. a polynucleotide may have thousands of such phosphodiester linkages. dna has a double-helix structure ([link]). the sugar and phosphate lie on the outside of the helix, forming the backbone of the dna. the nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior, like the steps of a staircase, in pairs; the pairs are bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. every base pair in the double helivx is separated from the next base pair by 0.34 nm. the two strands of the helix run in opposite directions, meaning that the 5 carbon end of one strand will face the 3 carbon end of its matching strand. (this is referred to as antiparallel orientation and is important to dna replication and in many nucleic acid interactions.) only certain types of base pairing are allowed. for example, a certain purine can only pair with a certain pyrimidine. this means a can pair with t, and g can pair with c, as shown in [link]. this is known as the base complementary rule. in other words, the dna strands are complementary to each other. if the sequence of one strand is aattggcc, the complementary strand would have the sequence ttaaccgg. during dna replication, each strand is copied, resulting in a daughter dna double helix containing one parental dna strand and a newly synthesized strand. in a double stranded dna molecule, the two strands run antiparallel to one another so that one strand runs 5 to 3 and the other 3 to 5. the phosphate backbone is located on the outside, and the bases are in the middle. adenine forms hydrogen bonds (or base pairs) with thymine, and guanine base pairs with cytosine.


 a mutation occurs, and cytosine is replaced with adenine. what impact do you think this will have on the dna structure? ribonucleic acid, or rna, is mainly involved in the process of protein synthesis under the direction of dna. rna is usually single-stranded and is made of ribonucleotides that are linked by phosphodiester bonds. a ribonucleotide in the rna chain contains ribose (the pentose sugar), one of the four nitrogenous bases (a, u, g, and c), and the phosphate group. there are four major types of rna: messenger rna (mrna), ribosomal rna (rrna), transfer rna (trna), and microrna (mirna). the first, mrna, carries the message from dna, which controls all of the cellular activities in a cell. if a cell requires a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene for this product is turned on and the messenger rna is synthesized in the nucleus. the rna base sequence is complementary to the coding sequence of the dna from which it has been copied. however, in rna, the base t is absent and u is present instead. if the dna strand has a sequence aattgcgc, the sequence of the complementary rna is uuaacgcg. in the cytoplasm, the mrna interacts with ribosomes and other cellular machinery ([link]). the mrna is read in sets of three bases known as codons. each codon codes for a single amino acid. in this way, the mrna is read and the protein product is made. ribosomal rna (rrna) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mrna binds. the rrna ensures the proper alignment of the mrna and the ribosomes; the rrna of the ribosome also has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids. transfer rna (trna) is one of the smallest of the four types of rna, usually 7090 nucleotides long. it carries the correct amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. it is the base pairing between the trna and mrna that allows for the correct amino acid to be inserted in the polypeptide chain. micrornas are the smallest rna molecules and their role involves the regulation of gene expression by interfering with the expression of certain mrna messages. [link] summarizes features of dna and rna. even though the rna is single stranded, most rna types show extensive intramolecular base pairing between complementary sequences, creating a predictable three-dimensional structure essential for their function. as you have learned, information flow in an organism takes place from dna to rna to protein. dna dictates the structure of mrna in a process known as transcription, and rna dictates the structure of protein in a process known as translation. this is known as the central dogma of life, which holds true for all organisms; however, exceptions to the rule occur in connection with viral infections. nucleic acids are molecules made up of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell division and protein synthesis. each nucleotide is made up of a pentose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. there are two types of nucleic acids: dna and rna. dna carries the genetic blueprint of the cell and is passed on from parents to offspring (in the form of chromosomes). it has a double-helical structure with the two strands running in opposite directions, connected by hydrogen bonds, and complementary to each other. rna is single-stranded and is made of a pentose sugar (ribose), a nitrogenous base, and a phosphate group. rna is involved in protein synthesis and its regulation. messenger rna (mrna) is copied from the dna, is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and contains information for the construction of proteins. ribosomal rna (rrna) is a part of the ribosomes at the site of protein synthesis, whereas transfer rna (trna) carries the amino acid to the site of protein synthesis. microrna regulates the use of mrna for protein synthesis.","[('rrna', 'rrnas'), ('nucleic acid', 'nucleic acids'), ('deoxyribonucleic acid', 'deoxyribonucleic acids'), ('mrna', 'mrnas'), ('transfer rna', 'transfer rnas'), ('nucleic acid', 'nucleic acidss', 'nucleic acids'), ('purine', 'purines'), ('trna', 'trnas'), ('dna', 'dnas'), ('double helix', 'double helixes'), ('ribonucleic acid', 'ribonucleic acids'), ('biological molecule', 'biological moleculess', 'biological molecules'), ('ribosomal rna', 'ribosomal rnas'), ('rna', 'rnas'), ('transcription', 'transcriptions'), ('nucleotide', 'nucleotides'), ('pyramidine', 'pyramidines'), ('translation', 'translations'), ('mirna', 'mirnas'), ('microrna', 'micrornas'), ('biological macromolecule', 'biological macromoleculess', 'biological macromolecules'), ('polynucleotide', 'polynucleotides'), ('phosphodiester', 'phosphodiesters'), ('messenger rna', 'messenger rnas')]"

14,stax-bio,4,Cell Structure,1,m44405,Studying Cells,"a cell is the smallest unit of a living thing. a living thing, whether made of one cell (like bacteria) or many cells (like a human), is called an organism. thus, cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms. several cells of one kind that interconnect with each other and perform a shared function form tissues, several tissues combine to form an organ (your stomach, heart, or brain), and several organs make up an organ system (such as the digestive system, circulatory system, or nervous system). several systems that function together form an organism (like a human being). here, we will examine the structure and function of cells. there are many types of cells, all grouped into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. for example, both animal and plant cells are classified as eukaryotic cells, whereas bacterial cells are classified as prokaryotic. before discussing the criteria for determining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic, lets first examine how biologists study cells. cells vary in size. with few exceptions, individual cells cannot be seen with the naked eye, so scientists use microscopes (micro- = small; -scope = to look at) to study them. a microscope is an instrument that magnifies an object. most photographs of cells are taken with a microscope, and these images can also be called micrographs. the optics of a microscopes lenses change the orientation of the image that the user sees. a specimen that is right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing left when viewed through a microscope, and vice versa. similarly, if the slide is moved left while looking through the microscope, it will appear to move right, and if moved down, it will seem to move up. this occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image. because of the manner by which light travels through the lenses, this system of two lenses produces an inverted image (binocular, or dissecting microscopes, work in a similar manner, but include an additional magnification system that makes the final image appear to be upright). to give you a sense of cell size, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight micrometers (abbreviated as eight m) in diameter; the head of a pin of is about two thousandths of a meter (two mm) in diameter. that means about 250 red blood cells could fit on the head of a pin. most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes ([link]a). visible light passes and is bent through the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. light microscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special stains. staining, however, usually kills the cells. light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to approximately 400 times. two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power. magnification is the process of enlarging an object in appearance. resolving power is the ability of a microscope to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate: the higher the resolution, the better the clarity and detail of the image. when oil immersion lenses are used for the study of small objects, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times. in order to gain a better understanding of cellular structure and function, scientists typically use electron microscopes. in contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes ([link]b) use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. not only does this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail ([link]), it also provides higher resolving power. the method used to prepare the specimen for viewing with an electron microscope kills the specimen. electrons have short wavelengths (shorter than photons) that move best in a vacuum, so living cells cannot be viewed with an electron microscope. in a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cells surface, creating details of cell surface characteristics. in a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam penetrates the cell and provides details of a cells internal structures. as you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and expensive than light microscopes. the microscopes we use today are far more complex than those used in the 1600s by antony van leeuwenhoek, a dutch shopkeeper who had great skill in crafting lenses. despite the limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van leeuwenhoek observed the movements of protista (a type of single-celled organism) and sperm, which he collectively termed animalcules. in a 1665 publication called micrographia, experimental scientist robert hooke coined the term cell for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens. in the 1670s, van leeuwenhoek discovered bacteria and protozoa. later advances in lenses, microscope construction, and staining techniques enabled other scientists to see some components inside cells. by the late 1830s, botanist matthias schleiden and zoologist theodor schwann were studying tissues and proposed the unified cell theory, which states that all living things are composed of one or more cells, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells. rudolf virchow later made important contributions to this theory. cytotechnologisthave you ever heard of a medical test called a pap smear ([link])? in this test, a doctor takes a small sample of cells from the uterine cervix of a patient and sends it to a medical lab where a cytotechnologist stains the cells and examines them for any changes that could indicate cervical cancer or a microbial infection. cytotechnologists (cyto- = cell) are professionals who study cells via microscopic examinations and other laboratory tests. they are trained to determine which cellular changes are within normal limits and which are abnormal. their focus is not limited to cervical cells; they study cellular specimens that come from all organs. when they notice abnormalities, they consult a pathologist, who is a medical doctor who can make a clinical diagnosis. cytotechnologists play a vital role in saving peoples lives. when abnormalities are discovered early, a patients treatment can begin sooner, which usually increases the chances of a successful outcome. a cell is the smallest unit of life. most cells are so tiny that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. therefore, scientists use microscopes to study cells. electron microscopes provide higher magnification, higher resolution, and more detail than light microscopes. the unified cell theory states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, the cell is the basic unit of life, and new cells arise from existing cells.","[('microscope', 'microscopes'), ('robert hooke', 'robert hookes'), ('matthia schleiden', 'matthia schleidens'), ('cytotechnologist', 'cytotechnologists'), ('anthony von leeuwenhoek', 'anthony von leeuwenhoeks', 'anthonies von leeuwenhoek', 'anthonies von leeuwenhoeks'), ('theodor schwann', 'theodor schwanns'), ('electron microscope', 'electron microscopes'), ('microscopy', 'microscopies'), ('cell structure', 'cell structures'), ('unified cell theory', 'unified cell theories', 'unified cells theory', 'unified cells theories'), ('light microscope', 'light microscopes'), ('cell theory', 'cell theories')]"
15,stax-bio,4,Cell Structure,2,m44406,Prokaryotic Cells,"cells fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. only the predominantly single-celled organisms of the domains bacteria and archaea are classified as prokaryotes (pro- = before; -kary- = nucleus). cells of animals, plants, fungi, and protists are all eukaryotes (ceu- = true) and are made up of eukaryotic cells. all cells share four common components: 1) a plasma membrane, an outer covering that separates the cells interior from its surrounding environment; 2) cytoplasm, consisting of a jelly-like cytosol within the cell in which other cellular components are found; 3) dna, the genetic material of the cell; and 4) ribosomes, which synthesize proteins. however, prokaryotes differ from eukaryotic cells in several ways. a prokaryote is a simple, mostly single-celled (unicellular) organism that lacks a nucleus, or any other membrane-bound organelle. we will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in eukaryotes. prokaryotic dna is found in a central part of the cell: the nucleoid ([link]). most prokaryotes have a peptidoglycan cell wall and many have a polysaccharide capsule ([link]). the cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. the capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment. some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. flagella are used for locomotion. pili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation. fimbriae are used by bacteria to attach to a host cell. microbiologistthe most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of contagious illnesses is to wash his or her hands. why? because microbes (organisms so tiny that they can only be seen with microscopes) are ubiquitous. they live on doorknobs, money, your hands, and many other surfaces. if someone sneezes into his hand and touches a doorknob, and afterwards you touch that same doorknob, the microbes from the sneezers mucus are now on your hands. if you touch your hands to your mouth, nose, or eyes, those microbes can enter your body and could make you sick. however, not all microbes (also called microorganisms) cause disease; most are actually beneficial. you have microbes in your gut that make vitamin k. other microorganisms are used to ferment beer and wine. microbiologists are scientists who study microbes. microbiologists can pursue a number of careers. not only do they work in the food industry, they are also employed in the veterinary and medical fields. they can work in the pharmaceutical sector, serving key roles in research and development by identifying new sources of antibiotics that could be used to treat bacterial infections. environmental microbiologists may look for new ways to use specially selected or genetically engineered microbes for the removal of pollutants from soil or groundwater, as well as hazardous elements from contaminated sites. these uses of microbes are called bioremediation technologies. microbiologists can also work in the field of bioinformatics, providing specialized knowledge and insight for the design, development, and specificity of computer models of, for example, bacterial epidemics. at 0.1 to 5.0 m in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging from 10 to 100 m ([link]). the small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly diffuse to other parts of the cell. similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly diffuse out. this is not the case in eukaryotic cells, which have developed different structural adaptations to enhance intracellular transport. small size, in general, is necessary for all cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic. lets examine why that is so. first, well consider the area and volume of a typical cell. not all cells are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a sphere. you may remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4r2, while the formula for its volume is 4r3/3. thus, as the radius of a cell increases, its surface area increases as the square of its radius, but its volume increases as the cube of its radius (much more rapidly). therefore, as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. this same principle would apply if the cell had the shape of a cube ([link]). if the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume. in other words, as a cell grows, it becomes less efficient. one way to become more efficient is to divide; another way is to develop organelles that perform specific tasks. these adaptations lead to the development of more sophisticated cells called eukaryotic cells. 
notice that as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. when there is insufficient surface area to support a cells increasing volume, a cell will either divide or die. the cell on the left has a volume of 1 mm3 and a surface area of 6 mm2, with a surface area-to-volume ratio of 6 to 1, whereas the cell on the right has a volume of 8 mm3 and a surface area of 24 mm2, with a surface area-to-volume ratio of 3 to 1.


 prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells. what advantages might small cell size confer on a cell? what advantages might large cell size have? prokaryotes are predominantly single-celled organisms of the domains bacteria and archaea. all prokaryotes have plasma membranes, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and dna that is not membrane-bound. most have peptidoglycan cell walls and many have polysaccharide capsules. prokaryotic cells range in diameter from 0.1 to 5.0 m. as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. if the cell grows too large, the plasma membrane will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased volume.","[('prokaryote', 'prokaryotes'), ('microbiologist', 'microbiologists'), ('prokaryotic cell', 'prokaryotic cells'), ('nucleoid', 'nucleoids'), ('cell size', 'cell sizes'), ('single-cell organism', 'single-cell organisms'), ('unicellular', 'unicellulars'), ('cell structure', 'cell structures')]"
16,stax-bio,4,Cell Structure,3,m44407,Eukaryotic Cells,"have you ever heard the phrase form follows function? its a philosophy practiced in many industries. in architecture, this means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities that will be carried out inside them. for example, a skyscraper should be built with several elevator banks; a hospital should be built so that its emergency room is easily accessible. our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function, especially in cell biology, and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells ( [link]). unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells  have: 1) a membrane-bound nucleus; 2) numerous membrane-bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, chloroplasts, mitochondria, and others; and 3) several, rod-shaped chromosomes. because a eukaryotic cells nucleus is surrounded by a membrane, it is often said to have a true nucleus. the word organelle means little organ, and, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have specialized functions. at this point, it should be clear to you that eukaryotic cells have a more complex structure than prokaryotic cells. organelles allow different functions to be compartmentalized in different areas of the cell. before turning to organelles, lets first examine two important components of the cell: the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm. 
these figures show the major organelles and other cell components of (a) a typical animal cell and (b) a typical eukaryotic plant cell. the plant cell has a cell wall, chloroplasts, plastids, and a central vacuolestructures not found in animal cells. plant cells do not have lysosomes or centrosomes.









 if the nucleolus were not able to carry out its function, what other cellular organelles would be affected? like prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have a plasma membrane ( [link]), a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins that separates the internal contents of the cell from its surrounding environment. a phospholipid is a lipid molecule with two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group. the plasma membrane controls the passage of organic molecules, ions, water, and oxygen into and out of the cell. wastes (such as carbon dioxide and ammonia) also leave the cell by passing through the plasma membrane. the plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption are folded into fingerlike projections called microvilli (singular = microvillus); ( [link]). such cells are typically found lining the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. this is an excellent example of form following function.
    people with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. the immune response damages microvilli, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb nutrients. this leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet. the cytoplasm is the entire region of a cell between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (a structure to be discussed shortly). it is made up of organelles suspended in the gel-like cytosol, the cytoskeleton, and various chemicals ( [link]). even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-solid consistency, which comes from the proteins within it. however, proteins are not the only organic molecules found in the cytoplasm. glucose and other simple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, and derivatives of glycerol are found there, too. ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, and many other elements are also dissolved in the cytoplasm. many metabolic reactions, including protein synthesis, take place in the cytoplasm. typically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell ( [link]). the nucleus (plural = nuclei) houses the cells dna and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins. lets look at it in more detail ( [link]). the nuclear envelope is a double-membrane structure that constitutes the outermost portion of the nucleus ( [link]). both the inner and outer membranes of the nuclear envelope are phospholipid bilayers. the nuclear envelope is punctuated with pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and rna between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. the nucleoplasm is the semi-solid fluid inside the nucleus, where we find the chromatin and the nucleolus. to understand chromatin, it is helpful to first consider chromosomes. chromosomes are structures within the nucleus that are made up of dna, the hereditary material. you may remember that in prokaryotes, dna is organized into a single circular chromosome. in eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear structures. every eukaryotic species has a specific number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its bodys cells. for example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, while in fruit flies, it is eight.
chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide. when the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, proteins are attached to chromosomes, and they resemble an unwound, jumbled bunch of threads. these unwound protein-chromosome complexes are called chromatin ( [link]); chromatin describes the material that makes up the chromosomes both when condensed and decondensed. we already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this? some chromosomes have sections of dna that encode ribosomal rna. a darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus (plural = nucleoli) aggregates the ribosomal rna with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the pores in the nuclear envelope to the cytoplasm. ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. when viewed through an electron microscope, ribosomes appear either as clusters (polyribosomes) or single, tiny dots that float freely in the cytoplasm. they may be attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope ( [link]).
electron microscopy has shown us that ribosomes, which are large complexes of protein and rna, consist of two subunits, aptly called large and small ( [link]). ribosomes receive their orders for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the dna is transcribed into messenger rna (mrna). the mrna travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mrna into a specific order of amino acids in a protein. amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. because proteins synthesis is an essential function of all cells (including enzymes, hormones, antibodies, pigments, structural components, and surface receptors), ribosomes are found in practically every cell. ribosomes are particularly abundant in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein. for example, the pancreas is responsible for creating several digestive enzymes and the cells that produce these enzymes contain many ribosomes. thus, we see another example of form following function. mitochondria (singular = mitochondrion) are often called the powerhouses or energy factories of a cell because they are responsible for making adenosine triphosphate (atp), the cells main energy-carrying molecule. atp represents the short-term stored energy of the cell. cellular respiration is the process of making atp using the chemical energy found in glucose and other nutrients. in mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. in fact, the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. in keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to point out that muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce atp. your muscle cells need a lot of energy to keep your body moving. when your cells dont get enough oxygen, they do not make a lot of atp. instead, the small amount of atp they make in the absence of oxygen is accompanied by the production of lactic acid. mitochondria are oval-shaped, double membrane organelles ( [link]) that have their own ribosomes and dna. each membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. the inner layer has folds called cristae. the area surrounded by the folds is called the mitochondrial matrix. the cristae and the matrix have different roles in cellular respiration. peroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. they carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids. they also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. (many of these oxidation reactions release hydrogen peroxide, h2o2, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined to peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the h2o2 into oxygen and water.) for example, alcohol is detoxified by peroxisomes in liver cells. glyoxysomes, which are specialized peroxisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars. vesicles and vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs that function in storage and transport. other than the fact that vacuoles are somewhat larger than vesicles, there is a very subtle distinction between them: the membranes of vesicles can fuse with either the plasma membrane or other membrane systems within the cell. additionally, some agents such as enzymes within plant vacuoles break down macromolecules. the membrane of a vacuole does not fuse with the membranes of other cellular components. at this point, you know that each eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, a nucleus, ribosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and in some, vacuoles, but there are some striking differences between animal and plant cells. while both animal and plant cells have microtubule organizing centers (mtocs), animal cells also have centrioles associated with the mtoc: a complex called the centrosome. animal cells each have a centrosome and lysosomes, whereas plant cells do not. plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts and other specialized plastids, and a large central vacuole, whereas animal cells do not. the centrosome is a microtubule-organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells. it contains a pair of centrioles, two structures that lie perpendicular to each other ( [link]). each centriole is a cylinder of nine triplets of microtubules. the centrosome (the organelle where all microtubules originate) replicates itself before a cell divides, and the centrioles appear to have some role in pulling the duplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of the dividing cell. however, the exact function of the centrioles in cell division isnt clear, because cells that have had the centrosome removed can still divide, and plant cells, which lack centrosomes, are capable of cell division. animal cells have another set of organelles not found in plant cells: lysosomes. the lysosomes are the cells garbage disposal. in plant cells, the digestive processes take place in vacuoles. enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles. these enzymes are active at a much lower ph than that of the cytoplasm. therefore, the ph within lysosomes is more acidic than the ph of the cytoplasm. many reactions that take place in the cytoplasm could not occur at a low ph, so again, the advantage of compartmentalizing the eukaryotic cell into organelles is apparent. if you examine  [link]b, the diagram of a plant cell, you will see a structure external to the plasma membrane called the cell wall. the cell wall is a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. fungal and protistan cells also have cell walls.
    while the chief component of prokaryotic cell walls is peptidoglycan, the major organic molecule in the plant cell wall is cellulose ( [link]), a polysaccharide made up of glucose units. have you ever noticed that when you bite into a raw vegetable, like celery, it crunches? thats because you are tearing the rigid cell walls of the celery cells with your teeth. like the mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own dna and ribosomes, but chloroplasts have an entirely different function. chloroplasts are plant cell organelles that carry out photosynthesis. photosynthesis is the series of reactions that use carbon dioxide, water, and light energy to make glucose and oxygen. this is a major difference between plants and animals; plants (autotrophs) are able to make their own food, like sugars, while animals (heterotrophs) must ingest their food. like mitochondria, chloroplasts have outer and inner membranes, but within the space enclosed by a chloroplasts inner membrane is a set of interconnected and stacked fluid-filled membrane sacs called thylakoids ( [link]). each stack of thylakoids is called a granum (plural = grana). the fluid enclosed by the inner membrane that surrounds the grana is called the stroma. the chloroplasts contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which captures the light energy that drives the reactions of photosynthesis. like plant cells, photosynthetic protists also have chloroplasts. some bacteria perform photosynthesis, but their chlorophyll is not relegated to an organelle. endosymbiosiswe have mentioned that both mitochondria and chloroplasts contain dna and ribosomes. have you wondered why? strong evidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation. symbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species depend on each other for their survival. endosymbiosis (endo- = within) is a mutually beneficial relationship in which one organism lives inside the other. endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. we have already mentioned that microbes that produce vitamin k live inside the human gut. this relationship is beneficial for us because we are unable to synthesize vitamin k. it is also beneficial for the microbes because they are protected from other organisms and from drying out, and they receive abundant food from the environment of the large intestine. scientists have long noticed that bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are similar in size. we also know that bacteria have dna and ribosomes, just as mitochondria and chloroplasts do. scientists believe that host cells and bacteria formed an endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells ingested both aerobic and autotrophic bacteria (cyanobacteria) but did not destroy them. through many millions of years of evolution, these ingested bacteria became more specialized in their functions, with the aerobic bacteria becoming mitochondria and the autotrophic bacteria becoming chloroplasts. previously, we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells. if you look at  [link]b, you will see that plant cells each have a large central vacuole that occupies most of the area of the cell. the central vacuole plays a key role in regulating the cells concentration of water in changing environmental conditions. have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days, it wilts? thats because as the water concentration in the soil becomes lower than the water concentration in the plant, water moves out of the central vacuoles and cytoplasm. as the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves the cell wall unsupported. this loss of support to the cell walls of plant cells results in the wilted appearance of the plant. the central vacuole also supports the expansion of the cell. when the central vacuole holds more water, the cell gets larger without having to invest a lot of energy in synthesizing new cytoplasm. like a prokaryotic cell, a eukaryotic cell has a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes, but a eukaryotic cell is typically larger than a prokaryotic cell, has a true nucleus (meaning its dna is surrounded by a membrane), and has other membrane-bound organelles that allow for compartmentalization of functions. the plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. the nucleuss nucleolus is the site of ribosome assembly. ribosomes are either found in the cytoplasm or attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. they perform protein synthesis. mitochondria participate in cellular respiration; they are responsible for the majority of atp produced in the cell. peroxisomes hydrolyze fatty acids, amino acids, and some toxins. vesicles and vacuoles are storage and transport compartments. in plant cells, vacuoles also help break down macromolecules. animal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes. the centrosome has two bodies perpendicular to each other, the centrioles, and has an unknown purpose in cell division. lysosomes are the digestive organelles of animal cells. plant cells and plant-like cells each have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a central vacuole. the plant cell wall, whose primary component is cellulose, protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts. the central vacuole can expand without having to produce more cytoplasm.","[('centrosome', 'centrosomes'), ('nucleoplasm', 'nucleoplasms'), ('endosymbiosi', 'endosymbioses', 'endosymbiosis'), ('plasma membrane', 'plasma membranes'), ('chromosome', 'chromosomes'), ('lysosome', 'lysosomes'), ('chromatin', 'chromatins'), ('central vacuole', 'central vacuoles'), ('phospholipid bilayer', 'phospholipid bilayers'), ('organelle', 'organelles'), ('mitochondrium', 'mitochondrias', 'mitochondria'), ('chlorophyll', 'chlorophylls'), ('eukaryote', 'eukaryotes'), ('animal cell', 'animal cells'), ('nuclear envelope', 'nuclear envelopes'), ('peroxisome', 'peroxisomes'), ('nucleu', 'nucleuss', 'nucleus'), ('eukaryotic cell', 'eukaryotic cells'), ('chloroplast', 'chloroplasts'), ('nucleolu', 'nucleoli', 'nucleolus'), ('cytosol', 'cytosols'), ('ribosome', 'ribosomes'), ('cell wall', 'cell walls'), ('vesicle', 'vesicles'), ('cell structure', 'cell structures'), ('cytoplasm', 'cytoplasms'), ('plant cell', 'plant cells')]"
17,stax-bio,4,Cell Structure,4,m44435,The Endomembrane System and Proteins,"the endomembrane system (endo = within) is a group of membranes and organelles ([link]) in eukaryotic cells that works together to modify, package, and transport lipids and proteins. it includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, and vesicles, which weve already mentioned, and the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly. although not technically within the cell, the plasma membrane is included in the endomembrane system because, as you will see, it interacts with the other endomembranous organelles. the endomembrane system does not include the membranes of either mitochondria or chloroplasts. ""membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rer). the rer also sometimes modifies proteins. in this illustration, a (green) integral membrane protein in the er is modified by attachment of a (purple) carbohydrate. vesicles with the integral protein bud from the er and fuse with the cis face of the golgi apparatus. as the protein passes along  the golgis cisternae, it is further modified by the addition of more carbohydrates. after its synthesis is complete, it exits as integral membrane protein of the vesicle that bud from the golgis trans face and when the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane the protein becomes integral portion  of that cell membrane. (credit: modification of work by magnus manske)


 if a peripheral membrane protein were synthesized in the lumen (inside) of the er, would it end up on the inside or outside of the plasma membrane? the endoplasmic reticulum (er) ([link]) is a series of interconnected membranous sacs and tubules that collectively modifies proteins and synthesizes lipids. however, these two functions are performed in separate areas of the er: the rough er and the smooth er, respectively. the hollow portion of the er tubules is called the lumen or cisternal space. the membrane of the er, which is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins, is continuous with the nuclear envelope. the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rer) is so named because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface give it a studded appearance when viewed through an electron microscope ([link]). ribosomes transfer their newly synthesized proteins into the lumen of the rer where they undergo structural modifications, such as folding or the acquisition of side chains. these modified proteins will be incorporated into cellular membranesthe membrane of the er or those of other organellesor secreted from the cell (such as protein hormones, enzymes). the rer also makes phospholipids for cellular membranes. if the phospholipids or modified proteins are not destined to stay in the rer, they will reach their destinations via transport vesicles that bud from the rers membrane ([link]). since the rer is engaged in modifying proteins (such as enzymes, for example) that will be secreted from the cell, you would be correct in assuming that the rer is abundant in cells that secrete proteins. this is the case with cells of the liver, for example. the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ser) is continuous with the rer but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface ([link]). functions of the ser include synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids, and steroid hormones; detoxification of medications and poisons; and storage of calcium ions. in muscle cells, a specialized ser called the sarcoplasmic reticulum is responsible for storage of the calcium ions that are needed to trigger the coordinated contractions of the muscle cells. cardiologistheart disease is the leading cause of death in the united states. this is primarily due to our sedentary lifestyle and our high trans-fat diets. heart failure is just one of many disabling heart conditions. heart failure does not mean that the heart has stopped working. rather, it means that the heart cant pump with sufficient force to transport oxygenated blood to all the vital organs. left untreated, heart failure can lead to kidney failure and failure of other organs. the wall of the heart is composed of cardiac muscle tissue. heart failure occurs when the endoplasmic reticula of cardiac muscle cells do not function properly. as a result, an insufficient number of calcium ions are available to trigger a sufficient contractile force. cardiologists (cardi- = heart; -ologist = one who studies) are doctors who specialize in treating heart diseases, including heart failure. cardiologists can make a diagnosis of heart failure via physical examination, results from an electrocardiogram (ecg, a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart), a chest x-ray to see whether the heart is enlarged, and other tests. if heart failure is diagnosed, the cardiologist will typically prescribe appropriate medications and recommend a reduction in table salt intake and a supervised exercise program. we have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the er and transport their contents elsewhere, but where do the vesicles go? before reaching their final destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles still need to be sorted, packaged, and tagged so that they wind up in the right place. sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins takes place in the golgi apparatus (also called the golgi body), a series of flattened membranes ([link]). the receiving side of the golgi apparatus is called the cis face. the opposite side is called the trans face. the transport vesicles that formed from the er travel to the cis face, fuse with it, and empty their contents into the lumen of the golgi apparatus. as the proteins and lipids travel through the golgi, they undergo further modifications that allow them to be sorted. the most frequent modification is the addition of short chains of sugar molecules. these newly modified proteins and lipids are then tagged with phosphate groups or other small molecules so that they can be routed to their proper destinations. finally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into secretory vesicles that bud from the trans face of the golgi. while some of these vesicles deposit their contents into other parts of the cell where they will be used, other secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell. in another example of form following function, cells that engage in a great deal of secretory activity (such as cells of the salivary glands that secrete digestive enzymes or cells of the immune system that secrete antibodies) have an abundance of golgi. in plant cells, the golgi apparatus has the additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides, some of which are incorporated into the cell wall and some of which are used in other parts of the cell. geneticistmany diseases arise from genetic mutations that prevent the synthesis of critical proteins. one such disease is lowe disease (also called oculocerebrorenal syndrome, because it affects the eyes, brain, and kidneys). in lowe disease, there is a deficiency in an enzyme localized to the golgi apparatus. children with lowe disease are born with cataracts, typically develop kidney disease after the first year of life, and may have impaired mental abilities. lowe disease is a genetic disease caused by a mutation on the x chromosome. the x chromosome is one of the two human sex chromosome, as these chromosomes determine a person's sex. females possess two x chromosomes while males possess one x and one y chromosome. in females, the genes on only one of the two x chromosomes are expressed.  therefore, females who carry the lowe disease gene on one of their x chromosomes have a 50/50 chance of having the disease. however, males only have one x chromosome and the genes on this chromosome are always expressed. therefore, males will always have lowe disease if their x chromosome carries the lowe disease gene. the location of the mutated gene, as well as the locations of many other mutations that cause genetic diseases, has now been identified. through prenatal testing, a woman can find out if the fetus she is carrying may be afflicted with one of several genetic diseases. geneticists analyze the results of prenatal genetic tests and may counsel pregnant women on available options. they may also conduct genetic research that leads to new drugs or foods, or perform dna analyses that are used in forensic investigations. in addition to their role as the digestive component and organelle-recycling facility of animal cells, lysosomes are considered to be parts of the endomembrane system. lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy pathogens (disease-causing organisms) that might enter the cell. a good example of this occurs in a group of white blood cells called macrophages, which are part of your bodys immune system. in a process known as phagocytosis or endocytosis, a section of the plasma membrane of the macrophage invaginates (folds in) and engulfs a pathogen. the invaginated section, with the pathogen inside, then pinches itself off from the plasma membrane and becomes a vesicle. the vesicle fuses with a lysosome. the lysosomes hydrolytic enzymes then destroy the pathogen ([link]). the endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, vesicles, the er, and golgi apparatus, as well as the plasma membrane. these cellular components work together to modify, package, tag, and transport proteins and lipids that form the membranes. the rer modifies proteins and synthesizes phospholipids used in cell membranes. the ser synthesizes carbohydrates, lipids, and steroid hormones; engages in the detoxification of medications and poisons; and stores calcium ions. sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins take place in the golgi apparatus. lysosomes are created by the budding of the membranes of the rer and golgi. lysosomes digest macromolecules, recycle worn-out organelles, and destroy pathogens.","[('geneticist', 'geneticists'), ('rough endoplasmic reticulum', 'rough endoplasmic reticulums'), ('rer', 'rers'), ('protein', 'proteins'), ('golgi apparatu',

18,stax-bio,4,Cell Structure,5,m44412,The Cytoskeleton,"if you were to remove all the organelles from a cell, would the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm be the only components left? no. within the cytoplasm, there would still be ions and organic molecules, plus a network of protein fibers that help maintain the shape of the cell, secure some organelles in specific positions, allow cytoplasm and vesicles to move within the cell, and enable cells within multicellular organisms to move. collectively, this network of protein fibers is known as the cytoskeleton. there are three types of fibers within the cytoskeleton: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules ([link]). here, we will examine each. of the three types of protein fibers in the cytoskeleton, microfilaments are the narrowest. they function in cellular movement, have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are made of two intertwined strands of a globular protein called actin ([link]). for this reason, microfilaments are also known as actin filaments. actin is powered by atp to assemble its filamentous form, which serves as a track for the movement of a motor protein called myosin. this enables actin to engage in cellular events requiring motion, such as cell division in animal cells and cytoplasmic streaming, which is the circular movement of the cell cytoplasm in plant cells. actin and myosin are plentiful in muscle cells. when your actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, your muscles contract. microfilaments also provide some rigidity and shape to the cell. they can depolymerize (disassemble) and reform quickly, thus enabling a cell to change its shape and move. white blood cells (your bodys infection-fighting cells) make good use of this ability. they can move to the site of an infection and phagocytize the pathogen. to see an example of a white blood cell in action, watch a short time-lapse video of the cell capturing two bacteria. it engulfs one and then moves on to the other.

 intermediate filaments are made of several strands of fibrous proteins that are wound together ([link]). these elements of the cytoskeleton get their name from the fact that their diameter, 8 to 10 nm, is between those of microfilaments and microtubules. intermediate filaments have no role in cell movement. their function is purely structural. they bear tension, thus maintaining the shape of the cell, and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place. [link] shows how intermediate filaments create a supportive scaffolding inside the cell. the intermediate filaments are the most diverse group of cytoskeletal elements. several types of fibrous proteins are found in the intermediate filaments. you are probably most familiar with keratin, the fibrous protein that strengthens your hair, nails, and the epidermis of the skin. as their name implies, microtubules are small hollow tubes. the walls of the microtubule are made of polymerized dimers of -tubulin and -tubulin, two globular proteins ([link]). with a diameter of about 25 nm, microtubules are the widest components of the cytoskeleton. they help the cell resist compression, provide a track along which vesicles move through the cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. like microfilaments, microtubules can dissolve and reform quickly. microtubules are also the structural elements of flagella, cilia, and centrioles (the latter are the two perpendicular bodies of the centrosome). in fact, in animal cells, the centrosome is the microtubule-organizing center. in eukaryotic cells, flagella and cilia are quite different structurally from their counterparts in prokaryotes, as discussed below. to refresh your memory, flagella (singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell (for example, sperm, euglena). when present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella. when cilia (singular = cilium) are present, however, many of them extend along the entire surface of the plasma membrane. they are short, hair-like structures that are used to move entire cells (such as paramecia) or substances along the outer surface of the cell (for example, the cilia of cells lining the fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that trap particulate matter and move it toward your nostrils.) despite their differences in length and number, flagella and cilia share a common structural arrangement of microtubules called a 9 + 2 array. this is an appropriate name because a single flagellum or cilium is made of a ring of nine microtubule doublets, surrounding a single microtubule doublet in the center ([link]). you have now completed a broad survey of the components of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. for a summary of cellular components in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, see  [link]. the cytoskeleton has three different types of protein elements. from narrowest to widest, they are the microfilaments (actin filaments), intermediate filaments, and microtubules. microfilaments are often associated with myosin. they provide rigidity and shape to the cell and facilitate cellular movements. intermediate filaments bear tension and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place. microtubules help the cell resist compression, serve as tracks for motor proteins that move vesicles through the cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. they are also the structural element of centrioles, flagella, and cilia.","[('centrosome', 'centrosomes'), ('cilium', 'ciliums'), ('cell structure', 'cell structures'), ('intermediate filament', 'intermediate filaments'), ('flagella', 'flagellas'), ('mitochondrium', 'mitochondrias', 'mitochondria'), ('lysosome', 'lysosomes'), ('cilium', 'cilias', 'cilia'), ('microfilament', 'microfilaments'), ('microtubule', 'microtubules'), ('golgi apparatu', 'golgi ', 'golgi apparatus'), ('peroxisome', 'peroxisomes'), ('nucleu', 'nucleuss', 'nucleus'), ('chloroplast', 'chloroplasts'), ('cytoplasm', 'cytoplasms'), ('nucleoid', 'nucleoids'), ('vacuole', 'vacuoles'), ('cytoskeleton', 'cytoskeletons'), ('cell wall', 'cell walls'), ('flagellum', 'flagellums'), ('vesicle', 'vesicles'), ('endoplasmic reticulum', 'endoplasmic reticulums'), ('ribosome', 'ribosomes'), ('plasma membrane', 'plasma membranes')]"
19,stax-bio,4,Cell Structure,6,m44413,Connections between Cells and Cellular Activities,"you already know that a group of similar cells working together is called a tissue. as you might expect, if cells are to work together, they must communicate with each other, just as you need to communicate with others if you work on a group project. lets take a look at how cells communicate with each other. most animal cells release materials into the extracellular space. the primary components of these materials are proteins, and the most abundant protein is collagen. collagen fibers are interwoven with carbohydrate-containing protein molecules called proteoglycans. collectively, these materials are called the extracellular matrix ([link]). not only does the extracellular matrix hold the cells together to form a tissue, but it also allows the cells within the tissue to communicate with each other. how can this happen? cells have protein receptors on the extracellular surfaces of their plasma membranes. when a molecule within the matrix binds to the receptor, it changes the molecular structure of the receptor. the receptor, in turn, changes the conformation of the microfilaments positioned just inside the plasma membrane. these conformational changes induce chemical signals inside the cell that reach the nucleus and turn on or off the transcription of specific sections of dna, which affects the production of associated proteins, thus changing the activities within the cell. blood clotting provides an example of the role of the extracellular matrix in cell communication. when the cells lining a blood vessel are damaged, they display a protein receptor called tissue factor. when tissue factor binds with another factor in the extracellular matrix, it causes platelets to adhere to the wall of the damaged blood vessel, stimulates the adjacent smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel to contract (thus constricting the blood vessel), and initiates a series of steps that stimulate the platelets to produce clotting factors. cells can also communicate with each other via direct contact, referred to as intercellular junctions. there are some differences in the ways that plant and animal cells do this. plasmodesmata are junctions between plant cells, whereas animal cell contacts include tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes. in general, long stretches of the plasma membranes of neighboring plant cells cannot touch one another because they are separated by the cell wall that surrounds each cell ([link]b). how then, can a plant transfer water and other soil nutrients from its roots, through its stems, and to its leaves? such transport uses the vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) primarily. there also exist structural modifications called plasmodesmata (singular = plasmodesma), numerous channels that pass between cell walls of adjacent plant cells, connect their cytoplasm, and enable materials to be transported from cell to cell, and thus throughout the plant ([link]). a tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent animal cells ([link]). the cells are held tightly against each other by proteins (predominantly two proteins called claudins and occludins). this tight adherence prevents materials from leaking between the cells; tight junctions are typically found in epithelial tissues that line internal organs and cavities, and comprise most of the skin. for example, the tight junctions of the epithelial cells lining your urinary bladder prevent urine from leaking out into the extracellular space. also found only in animal cells are desmosomes, which act like spot welds between adjacent epithelial cells ([link]). short proteins called cadherins in the plasma membrane connect to intermediate filaments to create desmosomes. the cadherins join two adjacent cells together and maintain the cells in a sheet-like formation in organs and tissues that stretch, like the skin, heart, and muscles. gap junctions in animal cells are like plasmodesmata in plant cells in that they are channels between adjacent cells that allow for the transport of ions, nutrients, and other substances that enable cells to communicate ([link]). structurally, however, gap junctions and plasmodesmata differ. gap junctions develop when a set of six proteins (called connexins) in the plasma membrane arrange themselves in an elongated donut-like configuration called a connexon. when the pores (doughnut holes) of connexons in adjacent animal cells align, a channel between the two cells forms. gap junctions are particularly important in cardiac muscle: the electrical signal for the muscle to contract is passed efficiently through gap junctions, allowing the heart muscle cells to contract in tandem. animal cells communicate via their extracellular matrices and are connected to each other via tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions. plant cells are connected and communicate with each other via plasmodesmata. when protein receptors on the surface of the plasma membrane of an animal cell bind to a substance in the extracellular matrix, a chain of reactions begins that changes activities taking place within the cell. plasmodesmata are channels between adjacent plant cells, while gap junctions are channels between adjacent animal cells. however, their structures are quite different. a tight junction is a watertight seal between two adjacent cells, while a desmosome acts like a spot weld.","[('tight junction', 'tight junctions'), ('gap junction', 'gap junctions'), ('cellular activity', 'cellular activities'), ('extracellular matrix', 'extracellular matrices'), ('cell structure', 'cell structures'), ('plasmodesmatum', 'plasmodesmatas', 'plasmodesmata'), ('desmosome', 'desmosomes'), ('plasmodesma', 'plasmodesmas')]"

21,stax-bio,5,Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes,1,m44416,Components and Structure,"a cells plasma membrane defines the cell, outlines its borders, and determines the nature of its interaction with its environment (see  [link] for a summary). cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled quantities. the plasma membrane must be very flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. these are the more obvious functions of a plasma membrane. in addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital for tissue and organ formation during early development, and which later plays a role in the self versus non-self distinction of the immune response. among the most sophisticated functions of the plasma membrane is the ability to transmit signals by means of complex, integral proteins known as receptors. these proteins act both as receivers of extracellular inputs and as activators of intracellular processes. these membrane receptors provide extracellular attachment sites for effectors like hormones and growth factors, and they activate intracellular response cascades when their effectors are bound. occasionally, receptors are hijacked by viruses (hiv, human immunodeficiency virus, is one example) that use them to gain entry into cells, and at times, the genes encoding receptors become mutated, causing the process of signal transduction to malfunction with disastrous consequences. the existence of the plasma membrane was identified in the 1890s, and its chemical components were identified in 1915. the principal components identified at that time were lipids and proteins. the first widely accepted model of the plasma membranes structure was proposed in 1935 by hugh davson and james danielli; it was based on the railroad track appearance of the plasma membrane in early electron micrographs. they theorized that the structure of the plasma membrane resembles a sandwich, with protein being analogous to the bread, and lipids being analogous to the filling. in the 1950s, advances in microscopy, notably transmission electron microscopy (tem), allowed researchers to see that the core of the plasma membrane consisted of a double, rather than a single, layer. a new model that better explains both the microscopic observations and the function of that plasma membrane was proposed by s.j. singer and garth l. nicolson in 1972. the explanation proposed by singer and nicolson is called the fluid mosaic model. the model has evolved somewhat over time, but it still best accounts for the structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them. the fluid mosaic model describes the structure of the plasma membrane as a mosaic of componentsincluding phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydratesthat gives the membrane a fluid character. plasma membranes range from 5 to 10 nm in thickness. for comparison, human red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 m wide, or approximately 1,000 times wider than a plasma membrane. the membrane does look a bit like a sandwich ([link]). the principal components of a plasma membrane are lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol), proteins, and carbohydrates attached to some of the lipids and some of the proteins. a phospholipid is a molecule consisting of glycerol, two fatty acids, and a phosphate-linked head group. cholesterol, another lipid composed of four fused carbon rings, is found alongside the phospholipids in the core of the membrane. the proportions of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates in the plasma membrane vary with cell type, but for a typical human cell, protein accounts for about 50 percent of the composition by mass, lipids (of all types) account for about 40 percent of the composition by mass, with the remaining 10 percent of the composition by mass being carbohydrates. however, the concentration of proteins and lipids varies with different cell membranes. for example, myelin, an outgrowth of the membrane of specialized cells that insulates the axons of the peripheral nerves, contains only 18 percent protein and 76 percent lipid. the mitochondrial inner membrane contains 76 percent protein and only 24 percent lipid. the plasma membrane of human red blood cells is 30 percent lipid. carbohydrates are present only on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane and are attached to proteins, forming glycoproteins, or attached to lipids, forming glycolipids. the main fabric of the membrane is composed of amphiphilic, phospholipid molecules. the hydrophilic or water-loving areas of these molecules (which look like a collection of balls in an artists rendition of the model) ([link]) are in contact with the aqueous fluid both inside and outside the cell. hydrophobic, or water-hating molecules, tend to be non-polar. they interact with other non-polar molecules in chemical reactions, but generally do not interact with polar molecules. when placed in water, hydrophobic molecules tend to form a ball or cluster. the hydrophilic regions of the phospholipids tend to form hydrogen bonds with water and other polar molecules on both the exterior and interior of the cell. thus, the membrane surfaces that face the interior and exterior of the cell are hydrophilic. in contrast, the interior of the cell membrane is hydrophobic and will not interact with water. therefore, phospholipids form an excellent two-layer cell membrane that separates fluid within the cell from the fluid outside of the cell. a phospholipid molecule ([link]) consists of a three-carbon glycerol backbone with two fatty acid molecules attached to carbons 1 and 2, and a phosphate-containing group attached to the third carbon. this arrangement gives the overall molecule an area described as its head (the phosphate-containing group), which has a polar character or negative charge, and an area called the tail (the fatty acids), which has no charge. the head can form hydrogen bonds, but the tail cannot. a molecule with this arrangement of a positively or negatively charged area and an uncharged, or non-polar, area is referred to as amphiphilic or dual-loving. this characteristic is vital to the structure of a plasma membrane because, in water, phospholipids tend to become arranged with their hydrophobic tails facing each other and their hydrophilic heads facing out. in this way, they form a lipid bilayera barrier composed of a double layer of phospholipids that separates the water and other materials on one side of the barrier from the water and other materials on the other side. in fact, phospholipids heated in an aqueous solution tend to spontaneously form small spheres or droplets (called micelles or liposomes), with their hydrophilic heads forming the exterior and their hydrophobic tails on the inside ([link]). proteins make up the second major component of plasma membranes. integral proteins (some specialized types are called integrins) are, as their name suggests, integrated completely into the membrane structure, and their hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions interact with the hydrophobic region of the the phospholipid bilayer ([link]). single-pass integral membrane proteins usually have a hydrophobic transmembrane segment that consists of 2025 amino acids. some span only part of the membraneassociating with a single layerwhile others stretch from one side of the membrane to the other, and are exposed on either side. some complex proteins are composed of up to 12 segments of a single protein, which are extensively folded and embedded in the membrane ([link]). this type of protein has a hydrophilic region or regions, and one or several mildly hydrophobic regions. this arrangement of regions of the protein tends to orient the protein alongside the phospholipids, with the hydrophobic region of the protein adjacent to the tails of the phospholipids and the hydrophilic region or regions of the protein protruding from the membrane and in contact with the cytosol or extracellular fluid. peripheral proteins are found on the exterior and interior surfaces of membranes, attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipids. peripheral proteins, along with integral proteins, may serve as enzymes, as structural attachments for the fibers of the cytoskeleton, or as part of the cells recognition sites. these are sometimes referred to as cell-specific proteins. the body recognizes its own proteins and attacks foreign proteins associated with invasive pathogens. carbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes. they are always found on the exterior surface of cells and are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids) ([link]). these carbohydrate chains may consist of 260 monosaccharide units and can be either straight or branched. along with peripheral proteins, carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other. these sites have unique patterns that allow the cell to be recognized, much the way that the facial features unique to each person allow him or her to be recognized. this recognition function is very important to cells, as it allows the immune system to differentiate between body cells (called self) and foreign cells or tissues (called non-self). similar types of glycoproteins and glycolipids are found on the surfaces of viruses and may change frequently, preventing immune cells from recognizing and attacking them. these carbohydrates on the exterior surface of the cellthe carbohydrate components of both glycoproteins and glycolipidsare collectively referred to as the glycocalyx (meaning sugar coating). the glycocalyx is highly hydrophilic and attracts large amounts of water to the surface of the cell. this aids in the interaction of the cell with its watery environment and in the cells ability to obtain substances dissolved in the water. as discussed above, the glycocalyx is also important for cell identification, self/non-self determination, and embryonic development, and is used in cell-cell attachments to form tissues. how viruses infect specific organsglycoprotein and glycolipid patterns on the surfaces of cells give many viruses an opportunity for infection. hiv and hepatitis viruses infect only specific organs or cells in the human body. hiv is able to penetrate the plasma membranes of a subtype of lymphocytes called t-helper cells, as well as some monocytes and central nervous system cells. the hepatitis virus attacks liver cells. these viruses are able to invade these cells, because the cells have binding sites on their surfaces that are specific to and compatible with certain viruses ([link]). other recognition sites on the viruss surface interact with the human immune system, prompting the body to produce antibodies. antibodies are made in response to the antigens or proteins associated with invasive pathogens, or in response to foreign cells, such as might occur with an organ transplant. these same sites serve as places for antibodies to attach and either destroy or inhibit the activity of the virus. unfortunately, these recognition sites on hiv change at a rapid rate because of mutations, making the production of an effective vaccine against the virus very difficult, as the virus evolves and adapts. a person infected with hiv will quickly develop different populations, or variants, of the virus that are distinguished by differences in these recognition sites. this rapid change of surface markers decreases the effectiveness of the persons immune system in attacking the virus, because the antibodies will not recognize the new variations of the surface patterns. in the case of hiv, the problem is compounded by the fact that the virus specifically infects and destroys cells involved in the immune response, further incapacitating the host. the mosaic characteristic of the membrane, described in the fluid mosaic model, helps to illustrate its nature. the integral proteins and lipids exist in the membrane as separate but loosely attached molecules. these resemble the separate, multicolored tiles of a mosaic picture, and they float, moving somewhat with respect to one another. the membrane is not like a balloon, however, that can expand and contract; rather, it is fairly rigid and can burst if penetrated or if a cell takes in too much water. however, because of its mosaic nature, a very fine needle can easily penetrate a plasma membrane without causing it to burst, and the membrane will flow and self-seal when the needle is extracted. the mosaic characteristics of the membrane explain some but not all of its fluidity. there are two other factors that help maintain this fluid characteristic. one factor is the nature of the phospholipids themselves. in their saturated form, the fatty acids in phospholipid tails are saturated with bound hydrogen atoms. there are no double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. this results in tails that are relatively straight. in contrast, unsaturated fatty acids do not contain a maximal number of hydrogen atoms, but they do contain some double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms; a double bond results in a bend in the string of carbons of approximately 30 degrees ([link]). thus, if saturated fatty acids, with their straight tails, are compressed by decreasing temperatures, they press in on each other, making a dense and fairly rigid membrane. if unsaturated fatty acids are compressed, the kinks in their tails elbow adjacent phospholipid molecules away, maintaining some space between the phospholipid molecules. this elbow room helps to maintain fluidity in the membrane at temperatures at which membranes with saturated fatty acid tails in their phospholipids would freeze or solidify. the relative fluidity of the membrane is particularly important in a cold environment. a cold environment tends to compress membranes composed largely of saturated fatty acids, making them less fluid and more susceptible to rupturing. many organisms (fish are one example) are capable of adapting to cold environments by changing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes in response to the lowering of the temperature. animals have an additional membrane constituent that assists in maintaining fluidity. cholesterol, which lies alongside the phospholipids in the membrane, tends to dampen the effects of temperature on the membrane. thus, this lipid functions as a buffer, preventing lower temperatures from inhibiting fluidity and preventing increased temperatures from increasing fluidity too much. thus, cholesterol extends, in both directions, the range of temperature in which the membrane is appropriately fluid and consequently functional. cholesterol also serves other functions, such as organizing clusters of transmembrane proteins into lipid rafts. immunologistthe variations in peripheral proteins and carbohydrates that affect a cells recognition sites are of prime interest in immunology. these changes are taken into consideration in vaccine development. many infectious diseases, such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and tetanus, were conquered by the use of vaccines. immunologists are the physicians and scientists who research and develop vaccines, as well as treat and study allergies or other immune problems. some immunologists study and treat autoimmune problems (diseases in which a persons immune system attacks his or her own cells or tissues, such as lupus) and immunodeficiencies, whether acquired (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or aids) or hereditary (such as severe combined immunodeficiency, or scid). immunologists are called in to help treat organ transplantation patients, who must have their immune systems suppressed so that their bodies will not reject a transplanted organ. some immunologists work to understand natural immunity and the effects of a persons environment on it. others work on questions about how the immune system affects diseases such as cancer. in the past, the importance of having a healthy immune system in preventing cancer was not at all understood. to work as an immunologist, a phd or md is required. in addition, immunologists undertake at least 23 years of training in an accredited program and must pass an examination given by the american board of allergy and immunology. immunologists must possess knowledge of the functions of the human body as they relate to issues beyond immunization, and knowledge of pharmacology and medical technology, such as medications, therapies, test materials, and surgical procedures. the modern understanding of the plasma membrane is referred to as the fluid mosaic model. the plasma membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, with their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with each other. the landscape of the membrane is studded with proteins, some of which span the membrane. some of these proteins serve to transport materials into or out of the cell. carbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing surface of the membrane, forming complexes that function to identify the cell to other cells. the fluid nature of the membrane is due to temperature, the configuration of the fatty acid tails (some kinked by double bonds), the presence of cholesterol embedded in the membrane, and the mosaic nature of the proteins and protein-carbohydrate combinations, which are not firmly fixed in place. plasma membranes enclose and define the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux.","[('amphiphilic', 'amphiphilics'), ('hydrophobic tail',

22,stax-bio,5,Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes,2,m44417,Passive Transport,"plasma membranes must allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell, and prevent some harmful materials from entering and some essential materials from leaving. in other words, plasma membranes are selectively permeablethey allow some substances to pass through, but not others. if they were to lose this selectivity, the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself, and it would be destroyed. some cells require larger amounts of specific substances than do other cells; they must have a way of obtaining these materials from extracellular fluids. this may happen passively, as certain materials move back and forth, or the cell may have special mechanisms that facilitate transport. some materials are so important to a cell that it spends some of its energy, hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (atp), to obtain these materials. red blood cells use some of their energy doing just that. all cells spend the majority of their energy to maintain an imbalance of sodium and potassium ions between the interior and exterior of the cell. the most direct forms of membrane transport are passive. passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to exert any of its energy to accomplish the movement. in passive transport, substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. a physical space in which there is a range of concentrations of a single substance is said to have a concentration gradient. plasma membranes are asymmetric: the interior of the membrane is not identical to the exterior of the membrane. in fact, there is a considerable difference between the array of phospholipids and proteins between the two leaflets that form a membrane. on the interior of the membrane, some proteins serve to anchor the membrane to fibers of the cytoskeleton. there are peripheral proteins on the exterior of the membrane that bind elements of the extracellular matrix. carbohydrates, attached to lipids or proteins, are also found on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. these carbohydrate complexes help the cell bind substances that the cell needs in the extracellular fluid. this adds considerably to the selective nature of plasma membranes ([link]). recall that plasma membranes are amphiphilic: they have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. this characteristic helps the movement of some materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. lipid-soluble material with a low molecular weight can easily slip through the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane. substances such as the fat-soluble vitamins a, d, e, and k readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. fat-soluble drugs and hormones also gain easy entry into cells and are readily transported into the bodys tissues and organs. molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide have no charge and so pass through membranes by simple diffusion. polar substances present problems for the membrane. while some polar molecules connect easily with the outside of a cell, they cannot readily pass through the lipid core of the plasma membrane. additionally, while small ions could easily slip through the spaces in the mosaic of the membrane, their charge prevents them from doing so. ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride must have special means of penetrating plasma membranes. simple sugars and amino acids also need help with transport across plasma membranes, achieved by various transmembrane proteins (channels). diffusion is a passive process of transport. a single substance tends to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until the concentration is equal across a space. you are familiar with diffusion of substances through the air. for example, think about someone opening a bottle of ammonia in a room filled with people. the ammonia gas is at its highest concentration in the bottle; its lowest concentration is at the edges of the room. the ammonia vapor will diffuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the ammonia as it spreads. materials move within the cells cytosol by diffusion, and certain materials move through the plasma membrane by diffusion ([link]). diffusion expends no energy. on the contrary, concentration gradients are a form of potential energy, dissipated as the gradient is eliminated. each separate substance in a medium, such as the extracellular fluid, has its own concentration gradient, independent of the concentration gradients of other materials. in addition, each substance will diffuse according to that gradient. within a system, there will be different rates of diffusion of the different substances in the medium. molecules move constantly in a random manner, at a rate that depends on their mass, their environment, and the amount of thermal energy they possess, which in turn is a function of temperature. this movement accounts for the diffusion of molecules through whatever medium in which they are localized. a substance will tend to move into any space available to it until it is evenly distributed throughout it. after a substance has diffused completely through a space, removing its concentration gradient, molecules will still move around in the space, but there will be no net movement of the number of molecules from one area to another. this lack of a concentration gradient in which there is no net movement of a substance is known as dynamic equilibrium. while diffusion will go forward in the presence of a concentration gradient of a substance, several factors affect the rate of diffusion. a variation of diffusion is the process of filtration. in filtration, material moves according to its concentration gradient through a membrane; sometimes the rate of diffusion is enhanced by pressure, causing the substances to filter more rapidly. this occurs in the kidney, where blood pressure forces large amounts of water and accompanying dissolved substances, or solutes, out of the blood and into the renal tubules. the rate of diffusion in this instance is almost totally dependent on pressure. one of the effects of high blood pressure is the appearance of protein in the urine, which is squeezed through by the abnormally high pressure. in facilitated transport, also called facilitated diffusion, materials diffuse across the plasma membrane with the help of membrane proteins. a concentration gradient exists that would allow these materials to diffuse into the cell without expending cellular energy. however, these materials are ions are polar molecules that are repelled by the hydrophobic parts of the cell membrane. facilitated transport proteins shield these materials from the repulsive force of the membrane, allowing them to diffuse into the cell.  the material being transported is first attached to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. this allows the material that is needed by the cell to be removed from the extracellular fluid. the substances are then passed to specific integral proteins that facilitate their passage. some of these integral proteins are collections of beta pleated sheets that form a pore or channel through the phospholipid bilayer. others are carrier proteins which bind with the substance and aid its diffusion through the membrane. the integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins, and they function as either channels for the material or carriers. in both cases, they are transmembrane proteins. channels are specific for the substance that is being transported. channel proteins have hydrophilic domains exposed to the intracellular and extracellular fluids; they additionally have a hydrophilic channel through their core that provides a hydrated opening through the membrane layers ([link]). passage through the channel allows polar compounds to avoid the nonpolar central layer of the plasma membrane that would otherwise slow or prevent their entry into the cell. aquaporins are channel proteins that allow water to pass through the membrane at a very high rate. channel proteins are either open at all times or they are gated, which controls the opening of the channel. the attachment of a particular ion to the channel protein may control the opening, or other mechanisms or substances may be involved. in some tissues, sodium and chloride ions pass freely through open channels, whereas in other tissues a gate must be opened to allow passage. an example of this occurs in the kidney, where both forms of channels are found in different parts of the renal tubules. cells involved in the transmission of electrical impulses, such as nerve and muscle cells, have gated channels for sodium, potassium, and calcium in their membranes. opening and closing of these channels changes the relative concentrations on opposing sides of the membrane of these ions, resulting in the facilitation of electrical transmission along membranes (in the case of nerve cells) or in muscle contraction (in the case of muscle cells). another type of protein embedded in the plasma membrane is a carrier protein. this aptly named protein binds a substance and, in doing so, triggers a change of its own shape, moving the bound molecule from the outside of the cell to its interior ([link]); depending on the gradient, the material may move in the opposite direction. carrier proteins are typically specific for a single substance. this selectivity adds to the overall selectivity of the plasma membrane. the exact mechanism for the change of shape is poorly understood. proteins can change shape when their hydrogen bonds are affected, but this may not fully explain this mechanism. each carrier protein is specific to one substance, and there are a finite number of these proteins in any membrane. this can cause problems in transporting enough of the material for the cell to function properly. when all of the proteins are bound to their ligands, they are saturated and the rate of transport is at its maximum. increasing the concentration gradient at this point will not result in an increased rate of transport. an example of this process occurs in the kidney. glucose, water, salts, ions, and amino acids needed by the body are filtered in one part of the kidney. this filtrate, which includes glucose, is then reabsorbed in another part of the kidney. because there are only a finite number of carrier proteins for glucose, if more glucose is present than the proteins can handle, the excess is not transported and it is excreted from the body in the urine. in a diabetic individual, this is described as spilling glucose into the urine. a different group of carrier proteins called glucose transport proteins, or gluts, are involved in transporting glucose and other hexose sugars through plasma membranes within the body. channel and carrier proteins transport material at different rates. channel proteins transport much more quickly than do carrier proteins. channel proteins facilitate diffusion at a rate of tens of millions of molecules per second, whereas carrier proteins work at a rate of a thousand to a million molecules per second. osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane, which is inversely proportional to the concentration of solutes. while diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells, osmosis transports only water across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water. not surprisingly, the aquaporins that facilitate water movement play a large role in osmosis, most prominently in red blood cells and the membranes of kidney tubules. osmosis is a special case of diffusion. water, like other substances, moves from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration. an obvious question is what makes water move at all? imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane separating the two sides or halves ([link]). on both sides of the membrane the water level is the same, but there are different concentrations of a dissolved substance, or solute, that cannot cross the membrane (otherwise the concentrations on each side would be balanced by the solute crossing the membrane). if the volume of the solution on both sides of the membrane is the same, but the concentrations of solute are different, then there are different amounts of water, the solvent, on either side of the membrane. to illustrate this, imagine two full glasses of water. one has a single teaspoon of sugar in it, whereas the second one contains one-quarter cup of sugar. if the total volume of the solutions in both cups is the same, which cup contains more water? because the large amount of sugar in the second cup takes up much more space than the teaspoon of sugar in the first cup, the first cup has more water in it. returning to the beaker example, recall that it has a mixture of solutes on either side of the membrane. a principle of diffusion is that the molecules move around and will spread evenly throughout the medium if they can. however, only the material capable of getting through the membrane will diffuse through it. in this example, the solute cannot diffuse through the membrane, but the water can. water has a concentration gradient in this system. thus, water will diffuse down its concentration gradient, crossing the membrane to the side where it is less concentrated. this diffusion of water through the membraneosmosiswill continue until the concentration gradient of water goes to zero or until the hydrostatic pressure of the water balances the osmotic pressure. osmosis proceeds constantly in living systems. tonicity describes how an extracellular solution can change the volume of a cell by affecting osmosis.  a solution's tonicity often directly correlates with the osmolarity of the solution. osmolarity describes the total solute concentration of the solution. a solution with low osmolarity has a greater number of water molecules relative to the number of solute particles; a solution with high osmolarity has fewer water molecules with respect to solute particles. in a situation in which solutions of two different osmolarities are separated by a membrane permeable to water, though not to the solute, water will move from the side of the membrane with lower osmolarity (and more water) to the side with higher osmolarity (and less water). this effect makes sense if you remember that the solute cannot move across the membrane, and thus the only component in the system that can movethe watermoves along its own concentration gradient. an important distinction that concerns living systems is that osmolarity measures the number of particles (which may be molecules) in a solution. therefore, a solution that is cloudy with cells may have a lower osmolarity than a solution that is clear, if the second solution contains more dissolved molecules than there are cells. three termshypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonicare used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid that contains the cells. in a hypotonic situation, the extracellular fluid has lower osmolarity than the fluid inside the cell, and water enters the cell. (in living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so the prefix hypo- means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes, or a lower osmolarity, than the cell cytoplasm.) it also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher concentration of water in the solution than does the cell. in this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and enter the cell. as for a hypertonic solution, the prefix hyper- refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher osmolarity than the cells cytoplasm; therefore, the fluid contains less water than the cell does. because the cell has a relatively higher concentration of water, water will leave the cell. in an isotonic solution, the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell. if the osmolarity of the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid, there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell, although water will still move in and out. blood cells and plant cells in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions take on characteristic appearances ([link]). osmotic pressure changes the shape of red blood cells in hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions.

 a doctor injects a patient with what the doctor thinks is an isotonic saline solution. the patient dies, and an autopsy reveals that many red blood cells have been destroyed. do you think the solution the doctor injected was really isotonic? in a hypotonic environment, water enters a cell, and the cell swells. in an isotonic condition, the relative concentrations of solute and solvent are equal on both sides of the membrane. there is no net water movement; therefore, there is no change in the size of the cell. in a hypertonic solution, water leaves a cell and the cell shrinks. if either the hypo- or hyper- condition goes to excess, the cells functions become compromised, and the cell may be destroyed. a red blood cell will burst, or lyse, when it swells beyond the plasma membranes capability to expand. remember, the membrane resembles a mosaic, with discrete spaces between the molecules composing it. if the cell swells, and the spaces between the lipids and proteins become too large, the cell will break apart. in contrast, when excessive amounts of water leave a red blood cell, the cell shrinks, or crenates. this has the effect of concentrating the solutes left in the cell, making the cytosol denser and interfering with diffusion within the cell. the cells ability to function will be compromised and may also result in the death of the cell. various living things have ways of controlling the effects of osmosisa mechanism called osmoregulation. some organisms, such as plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists, have cell walls that surround the plasma membrane and prevent cell lysis in a hypotonic solution. the plasma membrane can only expand to the limit of the cell wall, so the cell will not lyse. in fact, the cytoplasm in plants is always slightly hypertonic to the cellular environment, and water will always enter a cell if water is available. this inflow of water produces turgor pressure, which stiffens the cell walls of the plant ([link]). in nonwoody plants, turgor pressure supports the plant. conversly, if the plant is not watered, the extracellular fluid will become hypertonic, causing water to leave the cell. in this condition, the cell does not shrink because the cell wall is not flexible. however, the cell membrane detaches from the wall and constricts the cytoplasm. this is called plasmolysis. plants lose turgor pressure in this condition and wilt ([link]). tonicity is a concern for all living things. for example, paramecia and amoebas, which are protists that lack cell walls, have contractile vacuoles. this vesicle collects excess water from the cell and pumps it out, keeping the cell from lysing as it takes on water from its environment ([link]). many marine invertebrates have internal salt levels matched to their environments, making them isotonic with the water in which they live. fish, however, must spend approximately five percent of their metabolic energy maintaining osmotic homeostasis. freshwater fish live in an environment that is hypotonic to their cells. these fish actively take in salt through their gills and excrete diluted urine to rid themselves of excess water. saltwater fish live in the reverse environment, which is hypertonic to their cells, and they secrete salt through their gills and excrete highly concentrated urine. in vertebrates, the kidneys regulate the amount of water in the body. osmoreceptors are specialized cells in the brain that monitor the concentration of solutes in the blood. if the levels of solutes increase beyond a certain range, a hormone is released that retards water loss through the kidney and dilutes the blood to safer levels. animals also have high concentrations of albumin, which is produced by the liver, in their blood. this protein is too large to pass easily through plasma membranes and is a major factor in controlling the osmotic pressures applied to tissues. the passive forms of transport, diffusion and osmosis, move materials of small molecular weight across membranes. substances diffuse from areas of high concentration to areas of lower concentration, and this process continues until the substance is evenly distributed in a system. in solutions containing more than one substance, each type of molecule diffuses according to its own concentration gradient, independent of the diffusion of other substances. many factors can affect the rate of diffusion, including concentration gradient, size of the particles that are diffusing, temperature of the system, and so on. in living systems, diffusion of substances into and out of cells is mediated by the plasma membrane. some materials diffuse readily through the membrane, but others are hindered, and their passage is made possible by specialized proteins, such as channels and transporters. the chemistry of living things occurs in aqueous solutions, and balancing the concentrations of those solutions is an ongoing problem. in living systems, diffusion of some substances would be slow or difficult without membrane proteins that facilitate transport.","[('hypertonic', 'hypertonics'), ('glucose transport protein', 'glucose

23,stax-bio,5,Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes,3,m44418,Active Transport,"active transport mechanisms require the use of the cells energy, usually in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). if a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradientthat is, if the concentration of the substance inside the cell is greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid (and vice versa)the cell must use energy to move the substance. some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight materials, such as ions, through the membrane. other mechanisms transport much larger molecules. we have discussed simple concentration gradientsdifferential concentrations of a substance across a space or a membranebut in living systems, gradients are more complex. because ions move into and out of cells and because cells contain proteins that do not move across the membrane and are mostly negatively charged, there is also an electrical gradient, a difference of charge, across the plasma membrane. the interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the extracellular fluid in which they are bathed, and at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (k+) and lower concentrations of sodium (na+) than does the extracellular fluid. so in a living cell, the concentration gradient of na+ tends to drive it into the cell, and the electrical gradient of na+ (a positive ion) also tends to drive it inward to the negatively charged interior. the situation is more complex, however, for other elements such as potassium. the electrical gradient of k+, a positive ion, also tends to drive it into the cell, but the concentration gradient of k+ tends to drive k+ out of the cell ([link]). the combined gradient of concentration and electrical charge that affects an ion is called its electrochemical gradient. electrochemical gradients arise from the combined effects of concentration gradients and electrical gradients.

 injection of a potassium solution into a persons blood is lethal; this is used in capital punishment and euthanasia. why do you think a potassium solution injection is lethal? to move substances against a concentration or electrochemical gradient, the cell must use energy. this energy is harvested from atp generated through the cells metabolism. active transport mechanisms, collectively called pumps, work against electrochemical gradients. small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes. active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other substances needed by living cells in the face of these passive movements. much of a cells supply of metabolic energy may be spent maintaining these processes. (most of a red blood cells metabolic energy is used to maintain the imbalance between exterior and interior sodium and potassium levels required by the cell.) because active transport mechanisms depend on a cells metabolism for energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the supply of atp. two mechanisms exist for the transport of small-molecular weight material and small molecules. primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane, which is directly dependent on atp. secondary active transport describes the movement of material that is due to the electrochemical gradient established by primary active transport that does not directly require atp. an important membrane adaption for active transport is the presence of specific carrier proteins or pumps to facilitate movement: there are three types of these proteins or transporters ([link]). a uniporter carries one specific ion or molecule. a symporter carries two different ions or molecules, both in the same direction. an antiporter also carries two different ions or molecules, but in different directions. all of these transporters can also transport small, uncharged organic molecules like glucose. these three types of carrier proteins are also found in facilitated diffusion, but they do not require atp to work in that process. some examples of pumps for active transport are na+-k+ atpase, which carries sodium and potassium ions, and h+-k+ atpase, which carries hydrogen and potassium ions. both of these are antiporter carrier proteins. two other carrier proteins are ca2+ atpase and h+ atpase, which carry only calcium and only hydrogen ions, respectively. both are pumps. the primary active transport that functions with the active transport of sodium and potassium allows secondary active transport to occur. the second transport method is still considered active because it depends on the use of energy as does primary transport ([link]). one of the most important pumps in animals cells is the sodium-potassium pump (na+-k+ atpase), which maintains the electrochemical gradient (and the correct concentrations of na+ and k+) in living cells. the sodium-potassium pump moves k+ into the cell while moving na+ out at the same time, at a ratio of three na+ for every two k+ ions moved in. the na+-k+ atpase exists in two forms, depending on its orientation to the interior or exterior of the cell and its affinity for either sodium or potassium ions. the process consists of the following six steps.  with the enzyme oriented towards the interior of the cell, the carrier has a high affinity for sodium ions. three ions bind to the protein. atp is hydrolyzed by the protein carrier and a low-energy phosphate group attaches to it. as a result, the carrier changes shape and re-orients itself towards the exterior of the membrane. the proteins affinity for sodium decreases and the three sodium ions leave the carrier. the shape change increases the carriers affinity for potassium ions, and two such ions attach to the protein. subsequently, the low-energy phosphate group detaches from the carrier. with the phosphate group removed and potassium ions attached, the carrier protein repositions itself towards the interior of the cell. the carrier protein, in its new configuration, has a decreased affinity for potassium, and the two ions are released into the cytoplasm. the protein now has a higher affinity for sodium ions, and the process starts again.  several things have happened as a result of this process. at this point, there are more sodium ions outside of the cell than inside and more potassium ions inside than out. for every three ions of sodium that move out, two ions of potassium move in. this results in the interior being slightly more negative relative to the exterior. this difference in charge is important in creating the conditions necessary for the secondary process. the sodium-potassium pump is, therefore, an electrogenic pump (a pump that creates a charge imbalance), creating an electrical imbalance across the membrane and contributing to the membrane potential. watch the video to see a simulation of active transport in a sodium-potassium atpase.

 secondary active transport brings sodium ions, and possibly other compounds, into the cell. as sodium ion concentrations build outside of the plasma membrane because of the action of the primary active transport process, an electrochemical gradient is created. if a channel protein exists and is open, the sodium ions will be pulled through the membrane. this movement is used to transport other substances that can attach themselves to the transport protein through the membrane ([link]). many amino acids, as well as glucose, enter a cell this way. this secondary process is also used to store high-energy hydrogen ions in the mitochondria of plant and animal cells for the production of atp. the potential energy that accumulates in the stored hydrogen ions is translated into kinetic energy as the ions surge through the channel protein atp synthase, and that energy is used to convert adp into atp. an electrochemical gradient, created by primary active transport, can move other substances against their concentration gradients, a process called co-transport or secondary active transport.

 if the ph outside the cell decreases, would you expect the amount of amino acids transported into the cell to increase or decrease? the combined gradient that affects an ion includes its concentration gradient and its electrical gradient. a positive ion, for example, might tend to diffuse into a new area, down its concentration gradient, but if it is diffusing into an area of net positive charge, its diffusion will be hampered by its electrical gradient. when dealing with ions in aqueous solutions, a combination of the electrochemical and concentration gradients, rather than just the concentration gradient alone, must be considered. living cells need certain substances that exist inside the cell in concentrations greater than they exist in the extracellular space. moving substances up their electrochemical gradients requires energy from the cell. active transport uses energy stored in atp to fuel this transport. active transport of small molecular-sized materials uses integral proteins in the cell membrane to move the materials: these proteins are analogous to pumps. some pumps, which carry out primary active transport, couple directly with atp to drive their action. in co-transport (or secondary active transport), energy from primary transport can be used to move another substance into the cell and up its concentration gradient.","[('symporter', 'symporters'), ('secondary active transport', 'secondary active transports'), ('primary active transport', 'primary active transports'), ('uniporter', 'uniporters'), ('membrane structure', 'membrane structures'), ('co-transport', 'co-transports'), ('electrochemical gradient', 'electrochemical gradients'), ('antiporter', 'antiporters'), ('plasma membrane', 'plasma membranes'), ('membrane function', 'membrane functions'), ('sodium-potassium pump', 'sodium-potassium pumps')]"
24,stax-bio,5,Structure and Function of Plasma Membranes,4,m44419,Bulk Transport,"in addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger molecules and particles (see  [link] for examples). some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms. you might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy. a large particle, however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell. endocytosis is a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells, into a cell. there are different variations of endocytosis, but all share a common characteristic: the plasma membrane of the cell invaginates, forming a pocket around the target particle. the pocket pinches off, resulting in the particle being contained in a newly created intracellular vesicle formed from the plasma membrane. phagocytosis (the condition of cell eating) is the process by which large particles, such as cells or relatively large particles, are taken in by a cell. for example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil will remove the invaders through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil ([link]). in preparation for phagocytosis, a portion of the inward-facing surface of the plasma membrane becomes coated with a protein called clathrin, which stabilizes this section of the membrane. the coated portion of the membrane then extends from the body of the cell and surrounds the particle, eventually enclosing it. once the vesicle containing the particle is enclosed within the cell, the clathrin disengages from the membrane and the vesicle merges with a lysosome for the breakdown of the material in the newly formed compartment (endosome). when accessible nutrients from the degradation of the vesicular contents have been extracted, the newly formed endosome merges with the plasma membrane and releases its contents into the extracellular fluid. the endosomal membrane again becomes part of the plasma membrane. a variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis. this literally means cell drinking and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. in reality, this is a process that takes in molecules, including water, which the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. pinocytosis results in a much smaller vesicle than does phagocytosis, and the vesicle does not need to merge with a lysosome ([link]). a variation of pinocytosis is called potocytosis. this process uses a coating protein, called caveolin, on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, which performs a similar function to clathrin. the cavities in the plasma membrane that form the vacuoles have membrane receptors and lipid rafts in addition to caveolin. the vacuoles or vesicles formed in caveolae (singular caveola) are smaller than those in pinocytosis. potocytosis is used to bring small molecules into the cell and to transport these molecules through the cell for their release on the other side of the cell, a process called transcytosis. a targeted variation of endocytosis employs receptor proteins in the plasma membrane that have a specific binding affinity for certain substances ([link]). in receptor-mediated endocytosis, as in phagocytosis, clathrin is attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. if uptake of a compound is dependent on receptor-mediated endocytosis and the process is ineffective, the material will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. some human diseases are caused by the failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. for example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or ldl (also referred to as bad cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. in the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the ldl receptors are defective or missing entirely. people with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear ldl particles from their blood. although receptor-mediated endocytosis is designed to bring specific substances that are normally found in the extracellular fluid into the cell, other substances may gain entry into the cell at the same site. flu viruses, diphtheria, and cholera toxin all have sites that cross-react with normal receptor-binding sites and gain entry into cells. the reverse process of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. exocytosis is the opposite of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid. waste material is enveloped in a membrane and fuses with the interior of the plasma membrane. this fusion opens the membranous envelope on the exterior of the cell, and the waste material is expelled into the extracellular space ([link]). other examples of cells releasing molecules via exocytosis include the secretion of proteins of the extracellular matrix and secretion of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft by synaptic vesicles. active transport methods require the direct use of atp to fuel the transport. large particles, such as macromolecules, parts of cells, or whole cells, can be engulfed by other cells in a process called phagocytosis. in phagocytosis, a portion of the membrane invaginates and flows around the particle, eventually pinching off and leaving the particle entirely enclosed by an envelope of plasma membrane. vesicle contents are broken down by the cell, with the particles either used as food or dispatched. pinocytosis is a similar process on a smaller scale. the plasma membrane invaginates and pinches off, producing a small envelope of fluid from outside the cell. pinocytosis imports substances that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid. the cell expels waste in a similar but reverse manner: it pushes a membranous vacuole to the plasma membrane, allowing the vacuole to fuse with the membrane and incorporate itself into the membrane structure, releasing its contents to the exterior.","[('exocytosi', 'exocytoses', 'exocytosis'), ('endocytosi', 'endocytoses', 'endocytosis'), ('membrane structure', 'membrane structures'), ('clathrin', 'clathrins'), ('bulk

25,stax-bio,6,Metabolism,0,m44421,Introduction,"virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy. energy is needed to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use a great deal of energy while thinking, and even during sleep. in fact, the living cells of every organism constantly use energy. nutrients and other molecules are imported, metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into new molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and may be distributed to the entire organism. for example, the large proteins that make up muscles are actively built from smaller molecules. complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building, energy is required for both the synthesis and breakdown of molecules. additionally, signaling molecules such as hormones and neurotransmitters are transported between cells. pathogenic bacteria and viruses are ingested and broken down by cells. cells must also export waste and toxins to stay healthy, and many cells must swim or move surrounding materials via the beating motion of cellular appendages like cilia and flagella. the cellular processes listed above require a steady supply of energy. from where, and in what form, does this energy come? how do living cells obtain energy, and how do they use it? this chapter will discuss different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer. this chapter will also describe how cells use energy and replenish it, and how chemical reactions in the cell are performed with great efficiency.","[('bioenergetic', 'bioenergeticss', 'bioenergetics'), ('metabolism', 'metabolisms'), ('energy', 'energies'), ('active site', 'active sites'), ('energy change', 'energy changes'), ('josiah willard gibb', 'josiah willard gibbss', 'josiah willard gibbs', 'josiah willards gibb', 'josiah willards gibbss', 'josiah willards gibbs', 'josiahs willard gibb', 'josiahs willard gibbss', 'josiahs willard gibbs', 'josiahs willards gibb', 'josiahs willards gibbss', 'josiahs willards gibbs'), ('energy currency', 'energy currencies'), ('cellular energy', 'cellular energies'), ('potential energy', 'potential energies'), ('first law of thermodynamic', 'first law of thermodynamicss', 'first law of thermodynamics', 'first laws of thermodynamic', 'first laws of thermodynamicss', 'first laws of thermodynamics'), ('atp hydrolysi', 'atp hydrolyses', 'atp hydrolysis'), ('anaerobic metabolism', 'anaerobic metabolisms'), ('endergonic reaction', 'endergonic reactions'), ('endergonic', 'endergonics'), ('sodium-potassium pump', 'sodium-potassium pumps'), ('gibb free energy', 'gibb free energies', 'gibbs free energy', 'gibbs free energies'), ('cofactor', 'cofactors'), ('exergonic reaction', 'exergonic reactions'), ('energy system', 'energy systems'), ('substrate specificity', 'substrate specificities'), ('allosteric activator', 'allosteric activators'), ('order', 'orders'), ('chemical energy', 'chemical energies'), ('anabolic pathway', 'anabolic pathways'), ('coenzyme', 'coenzymes'), ('heat', 'heats'), ('sugar metabolism', 'sugar metabolisms'), ('open system', 'open systems'), ('entropy', 'entropies'), ('vitamin', 'vitamins'), ('disorder', 'disorders'), ('phosphorylation', 'phosphorylations'), ('catabolic pathway', 'catabolic pathways'), ('transition state', 'transition states'), ('atp formation', 'atp formations'), ('allosteric inhibition', 'allosteric inhibitions'), ('enthalpy', 'enthalpies'), ('closed system', 'closed systems'), ('kinetic energy', 'kinetic energies'), ('randomnes', 'randomnesses', 'randomness'), ('energy transfer', 'energy transfers'), ('competitive inhibition', 'competitive inhibitions'), ('cellular respiration', 'cellular respirations'), ('energy of activation', 'energy of activation', 'energies of activation', 'energies of activation'), ('second law of thermodynamic', 'second law of thermodynamicss', 'second law of thermodynamics', 'second laws of thermodynamic', 'second laws of thermodynamicss', 'second laws of thermodynamics'), ('lock and key model', 'lock and key models', 'locks and key model', 'locks and key models'), ('thermodynamic', 'thermodynamicss', 'thermodynamics'), ('adenosine triphosphate', 'adenosine triphosphates'), ('enzyme active site', 'enzyme active sites', 'enzymes active site', 'enzymes active sites'), ('exergonic', 'exergonics'), ('spontaneous reaction', 'spontaneous reactions'), ('activation energy', 'activation energies'), ('law of thermodynamic', 'law of thermodynamics', 'law of thermodynamics', 'laws of thermodynamic', 'laws of thermodynamics', 'laws of thermodynamics'), ('metabolic pathway', 'metabolic pathways'), ('substrate', 'substrates'), ('feedback inhibition', 'feedback inhibitions'), ('deltum g', 'deltum gs'), ('atp', 'atps'), ('non-competitive inhibition', 'non-competitive inhibitions'), ('enzyme', 'enzymes'), ('molecular catalyst', 'molecular catalysts'), ('free energy', 'free energies'), ('induced fit', 'induced fits'), ('enzyme regulation', 'enzyme regulations'), ('allosteric regulator', 'allosteric regulators')]"
26,stax-bio,6,Metabolism,1,m44422,Energy and Metabolism,"scientists use the term bioenergetics to discuss the concept of energy flow ([link]) through living systems, such as cells. cellular processes such as the building and breaking down of complex molecules occur through stepwise chemical reactions. some of these chemical reactions are spontaneous and release energy, whereas others require energy to proceed. just as living things must continually consume food to replenish what has been used, cells must continually produce more energy to replenish that used by the many energy-requiring chemical reactions that constantly take place. all of the chemical reactions that take place inside cells, including those that use energy and those that release energy, are the cells metabolism. the metabolism of sugar (a simple carbohydrate) is a classic example of the many cellular processes that use and produce energy. living things consume sugar as a major energy source, because sugar molecules have a great deal of energy stored within their bonds. the breakdown of glucose, a simple sugar, is described by the equation: carbohydrates that are consumed have their origins in photosynthesizing organisms like plants ([link]). during photosynthesis, plants use the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide gas (co2) into sugar molecules, like glucose (c6h12o6). because this process involves synthesizing a larger, energy-storing molecule, it requires an input of energy to proceed. the synthesis of glucose is described by this equation (notice that it is the reverse of the previous equation): during the chemical reactions of photosynthesis, energy is provided in the form of a very high-energy molecule called atp, or adenosine triphosphate, which is the primary energy currency of all cells. just as the dollar is used as currency to buy goods, cells use molecules of atp as energy currency to perform immediate work. the sugar (glucose) is stored as starch or glycogen. energy-storing polymers like these are broken down into glucose to supply molecules of atp. solar energy is required to synthesize a molecule of glucose during the reactions of photosynthesis. in photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is initially transformed into chemical energy that is temporally stored in the energy carrier molecules atp and nadph (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). the stored energy in atp and nadph is then used later in photosynthesis to build one molecule of glucose from six molecules of co2. this process is analogous to eating breakfast in the morning to acquire energy for your body that can be used later in the day. under ideal conditions, energy from 18 molecules of atp is required to synthesize one molecule of glucose during the reactions of photosynthesis. glucose molecules can also be combined with and converted into other types of sugars. when sugars are consumed, molecules of glucose eventually make their way into each living cell of the organism. inside the cell, each sugar molecule is broken down through a complex series of chemical reactions. the goal of these reactions is to harvest the energy stored inside the sugar molecules. the harvested energy is used to make high-energy atp molecules, which can be used to perform work, powering many chemical reactions in the cell. the amount of energy needed to make one molecule of glucose from six molecules of carbon dioxide is 18 molecules of atp and 12 molecules of nadph (each one of which is energetically equivalent to three molecules of atp), or a total of 54 molecule equivalents required for the synthesis of one molecule of glucose. this process is a fundamental and efficient way for cells to generate the molecular energy that they require. the processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two types of metabolic pathways. a metabolic pathway is a series of interconnected biochemical reactions that convert a substrate molecule or molecules, step-by-step, through a series of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product or products. in the case of sugar metabolism, the first metabolic pathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down into smaller molecules. these two opposite processesthe first requiring energy and the second producing energyare referred to as anabolic (building) and catabolic (breaking down) pathways, respectively. consequently, metabolism is composed of building (anabolism) and degradation (catabolism). evolution of metabolic pathwaysthere is more to the complexity of metabolism than understanding the metabolic pathways alone. metabolic complexity varies from organism to organism. photosynthesis is the primary pathway in which photosynthetic organisms like plants (the majority of global synthesis is done by planktonic algae) harvest the suns energy and convert it into carbohydrates. the by-product of photosynthesis is oxygen, required by some cells to carry out cellular respiration. during cellular respiration, oxygen aids in the catabolic breakdown of carbon compounds, like carbohydrates. among the products of this catabolism are co2 and atp. in addition, some eukaryotes perform catabolic processes without oxygen (fermentation); that is, they perform or use anaerobic metabolism. organisms probably evolved anaerobic metabolism to survive (living organisms came into existence about 3.8 billion years ago, when the atmosphere lacked oxygen). despite the differences between organisms and the complexity of metabolism, researchers have found that all branches of life share some of the same metabolic pathways, suggesting that all organisms evolved from the same ancient common ancestor ([link]). evidence indicates that over time, the pathways diverged, adding specialized enzymes to allow organisms to better adapt to their environment, thus increasing their chance to survive. however, the underlying principle remains that all organisms must harvest energy from their environment and convert it to atp to carry out cellular functions. anabolic pathways require an input of energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones. synthesizing sugar from co2 is one example. other examples are the synthesis of large proteins from amino acid building blocks, and the synthesis of new dna strands from nucleic acid building blocks. these biosynthetic processes are critical to the life of the cell, take place constantly, and demand energy provided by atp and other high-energy molecules like nadh (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and nadph ([link]). atp is an important molecule for cells to have in sufficient supply at all times. the breakdown of sugars illustrates how a single molecule of glucose can store enough energy to make a great deal of atp, 36 to 38 molecules. this is a catabolic pathway. catabolic pathways involve the degradation (or breakdown) of complex molecules into simpler ones. molecular energy stored in the bonds of complex molecules is released in catabolic pathways and harvested in such a way that it can be used to produce atp. other energy-storing molecules, such as fats, are also broken down through similar catabolic reactions to release energy and make atp ([link]). it is important to know that the chemical reactions of metabolic pathways dont take place spontaneously. each reaction step is facilitated, or catalyzed, by a protein called an enzyme. enzymes are important for catalyzing all types of biological reactionsthose that require energy as well as those that release energy. cells perform the functions of life through various chemical reactions. a cells metabolism refers to the chemical reactions that take place within it. there are metabolic reactions that involve the breaking down of complex chemicals into simpler ones, such as the breakdown of large macromolecules. this process is referred to as catabolism, and such reactions are associated with a release of energy. on the other end of the spectrum, anabolism refers to metabolic processes that build complex molecules out of simpler ones, such as the synthesis of macromolecules. anabolic processes require energy. glucose synthesis and glucose breakdown are examples of anabolic and catabolic pathways, respectively.","[('catabolic pathway', 'catabolic pathways'), ('bioenergetic', 'bioenergeticss', 'bioenergetics'), ('metabolism', 'metabolisms'), ('energy', 'energies'), ('energy transfer', 'energy

27,stax-bio,6,Metabolism,2,m44425,"Potential, Kinetic, Free, and Activation Energy","energy is defined as the ability to do work. as youve learned, energy exists in different forms. for example, electrical energy, light energy, and heat energy are all different types of energy. while these are all familiar types of energy that one can see or feel, there is another type of energy that is much less tangible. this energy is associated with something as simple as an object held above the ground. in order to appreciate the way energy flows into and out of biological systems, it is important to understand more about the different types of energy that exist in the physical world. when an object is in motion, there is energy associated with that object. in the example of an airplane in flight, there is a great deal of energy associated with the motion of the airplane. this is because moving objects are capable of enacting a change, or doing work. think of a wrecking ball. even a slow-moving wrecking ball can do a great deal of damage to other objects. however, a wrecking ball that is not in motion is incapable of performing work. energy associated with objects in motion is called kinetic energy. a speeding bullet, a walking person, the rapid movement of molecules in the air (which produces heat), and electromagnetic radiation like light all have kinetic energy. now what if that same motionless wrecking ball is lifted two stories above a car with a crane? if the suspended wrecking ball is unmoving, is there energy associated with it? the answer is yes. the suspended wrecking ball has energy associated with it that is fundamentally different from the kinetic energy of objects in motion. this form of energy results from the fact that there is the potential for the wrecking ball to do work. if it is released, indeed it would do work. because this type of energy refers to the potential to do work, it is called potential energy. objects transfer their energy between kinetic and potential in the following way: as the wrecking ball hangs motionless, it has 0 kinetic and 100 percent potential energy. once it is released, its kinetic energy begins to increase because it builds speed due to gravity. at the same time, as it nears the ground, it loses potential energy. somewhere mid-fall it has 50 percent kinetic and 50 percent potential energy. just before it hits the ground, the ball has nearly lost its potential energy and has near-maximal kinetic energy. other examples of potential energy include the energy of water held behind a dam ([link]), or a person about to skydive out of an airplane. potential energy is not only associated with the location of matter (such as a child sitting on a tree branch), but also with the structure of matter. a spring on the ground has potential energy if it is compressed; so does a rubber band that is pulled taut. the very existence of living cells relies heavily on structural potential energy. on a chemical level, the bonds that hold the atoms of molecules together have potential energy. remember that anabolic cellular pathways require energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones, and catabolic pathways release energy when complex molecules are broken down. the fact that energy can be released by the breakdown of certain chemical bonds implies that those bonds have potential energy. in fact, there is potential energy stored within the bonds of all the food molecules we eat, which is eventually harnessed for use. this is because these bonds can release energy when broken. the type of potential energy that exists within chemical bonds, and is released when those bonds are broken, is called chemical energy ([link]). chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food. the release of energy is brought about by breaking the molecular bonds within fuel molecules. after learning that chemical reactions release energy when energy-storing bonds are broken, an important next question is how is the energy associated with chemical reactions quantified and expressed? how can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction? a measurement of free energy is used to quantitate these energy transfers. free energy is called gibbs free energy (abbreviated with the letter g) after josiah willard gibbs, the scientist who developed the measurement. recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve the loss of some amount of energy in an unusable form such as heat, resulting in entropy. gibbs free energy specifically refers to the energy associated with a chemical reaction that is available after entropy is accounted for. in other words, gibbs free energy is usable energy, or energy that is available to do work. every chemical reaction involves a change in free energy, called delta g (g). the change in free energy can be calculated for any system that undergoes such a change, such as a chemical reaction. to calculate g, subtract the amount of energy lost to entropy (denoted as s) from the total energy change of the system. this total energy change in the system is called enthalpy and is denoted as h . the formula for calculating g  is as follows, where the symbol t refers to absolute temperature in kelvin (degrees celsius + 273): the standard free energy change of a chemical reaction is expressed as an amount of energy per mole of the reaction product (either in kilojoules or kilocalories, kj/mol or kcal/mol; 1 kj = 0.239 kcal) under standard ph, temperature, and pressure conditions. standard ph, temperature, and pressure conditions are generally calculated at ph 7.0 in biological systems, 25 degrees celsius, and 100 kilopascals (1 atm pressure), respectively.  it is important to note that cellular conditions vary considerably from these standard conditions, and so standard calculated g  values for biological reactions will be different inside the cell. if energy is released during a chemical reaction, then the resulting value from the above equation will be a negative number. in other words, reactions that release energy have a g < 0. a negative g  also means that the products of the reaction have less free energy than the reactants, because they gave off some free energy during the reaction. reactions that have a negative g  and consequently release free energy are called exergonic reactions. think: exergonic means energy is exiting the system. these reactions are also referred to as spontaneous reactions, because they can occur without the addition of energy into the system. understanding which chemical reactions are spontaneous and release free energy is extremely useful for biologists, because these reactions can be harnessed to perform work inside the cell. an important distinction must be drawn between the term spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction that occurs immediately. contrary to the everyday use of the term, a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. the rusting of iron is an example of a spontaneous reaction that occurs slowly, little by little, over time. if a chemical reaction requires an input of energy rather than releasing energy, then the g  for that reaction will be a positive value. in this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. thus, the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy-storing molecules. these chemical reactions are called endergonic reactions, and they are non-spontaneous. an endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy. lets revisit the example of the synthesis and breakdown of the food molecule, glucose. remember that the building of complex molecules, such as sugars, from simpler ones is an anabolic process and requires energy. therefore, the chemical reactions involved in anabolic processes are endergonic reactions. on the other hand, the catabolic process of breaking sugar down into simpler molecules releases energy in a series of exergonic reactions. like the example of rust above, the breakdown of sugar involves spontaneous reactions, but these reactions dont occur instantaneously.  [link] shows some other examples of endergonic and exergonic reactions. later sections will provide more information about what else is required to make even spontaneous reactions happen more efficiently. an important concept in the study of metabolism and energy is that of chemical equilibrium. most chemical reactions are reversible. they can proceed in both directions, releasing energy into their environment in one direction, and absorbing it from the environment in the other direction ([link]). the same is true for the chemical reactions involved in cell metabolism, such as the breaking down and building up of proteins into and from individual amino acids, respectively. reactants within a closed system will undergo chemical reactions in both directions until a state of equilibrium is reached. this state of equilibrium is one of the lowest possible free energy and a state of maximal entropy. energy must be put into the system to push the reactants and products away from a state of equilibrium. either reactants or products must be added, removed, or changed. if a cell were a closed system, its chemical reactions would reach equilibrium, and it would die because there would be insufficient free energy left to perform the work needed to maintain life. in a living cell, chemical reactions are constantly moving towards equilibrium, but never reach it. this is because a living cell is an open system. materials pass in and out, the cell recycles the products of certain chemical reactions into other reactions, and chemical equilibrium is never reached. in this way, living organisms are in a constant energy-requiring, uphill battle against equilibrium and entropy. this constant supply of energy ultimately comes from sunlight, which is used to produce nutrients in the process of photosynthesis. there is another important concept that must be considered regarding endergonic and exergonic reactions. even exergonic reactions require a small amount of energy input to get going before they can proceed with their energy-releasing steps. these reactions have a net release of energy, but still require some energy in the beginning. this small amount of energy input necessary for all chemical reactions to occur is called the activation energy (or free energy of activation) and is abbreviated ea ([link]). why would an energy-releasing, negative g reaction actually require some energy to proceed? the reason lies in the steps that take place during a chemical reaction. during chemical reactions, certain chemical bonds are broken and new ones are formed. for example, when a glucose molecule is broken down, bonds between the carbon atoms of the molecule are broken. since these are energy-storing bonds, they release energy when broken. however, to get them into a state that allows the bonds to break, the molecule must be somewhat contorted. a small energy input is required to achieve this contorted state. this contorted state is called the transition state, and it is a high-energy, unstable state. for this reason, reactant molecules dont last long in their transition state, but very quickly proceed to the next steps of the chemical reaction. free energy diagrams illustrate the energy profiles for a given reaction. whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic determines whether the products in the diagram will exist at a lower or higher energy state than both the reactants and the products. however, regardless of this measure, the transition state of the reaction exists at a higher energy state than the reactants, and thus, ea is always positive. where does the activation energy required by chemical reactants come from? the source of the activation energy needed to push reactions forward is typically heat energy from the surroundings. heat energy (the total bond energy of reactants or products in a chemical reaction) speeds up the motion of molecules, increasing the frequency and force with which they collide; it also moves atoms and bonds within the molecule slightly, helping them reach their transition state. for this reason, heating up a system will cause chemical reactants within that system to react more frequently. increasing the pressure on a system has the same effect. once reactants have absorbed enough heat energy from their surroundings to reach the transition state, the reaction will proceed. the activation energy of a particular reaction determines the rate at which it will proceed. the higher the activation energy, the slower the chemical reaction will be. the example of iron rusting illustrates an inherently slow reaction. this reaction occurs slowly over time because of its high ea. additionally, the burning of many fuels, which is strongly exergonic, will take place at a negligible rate unless their activation energy is overcome by sufficient heat from a spark. once they begin to burn, however, the chemical reactions release enough heat to continue the burning process, supplying the activation energy for surrounding fuel molecules. like these reactions outside of cells, the activation energy for most cellular reactions is too high for heat energy to overcome at efficient rates. in other words, in order for important cellular reactions to occur at appreciable rates (number of reactions per unit time), their activation energies must be lowered ([link]); this is referred to as catalysis. this is a very good thing as far as living cells are concerned. important macromolecules, such as proteins, dna, and rna, store considerable energy, and their breakdown is exergonic. if cellular temperatures alone provided enough heat energy for these exergonic reactions to overcome their activation barriers, the essential components of a cell would disintegrate. energy comes in many different forms. objects in motion do physical work, and kinetic energy is the energy of objects in motion. objects that are not in motion may have the potential to do work, and thus, have potential energy. molecules also have potential energy because the breaking of molecular bonds has the potential to release energy. living cells depend on the harvesting of potential energy from molecular bonds to perform work. free energy is a measure of energy that is available to do work. the free energy of a system changes during energy transfers such as chemical reactions, and this change is referred to as g. the g  of a reaction can be negative or positive, meaning that the reaction releases energy or consumes energy, respectively. a reaction with a negative g  that gives off energy is called an exergonic reaction. one with a positive g  that requires energy input is called an endergonic reaction. exergonic reactions are said to be spontaneous, because their products have less energy than their reactants. the products of endergonic reactions have a higher energy state than the reactants, and so these are nonspontaneous reactions. however, all reactions (including spontaneous -g  reactions) require an initial input of energy in order to reach the transition state, at which theyll proceed. this initial input of energy is called the activation energy.","[('kinetic energy', 'kinetic energies'), ('potential energy', 'potential energies'), ('enthalpy', 'enthalpies'), ('josiah willard gibb', 'josiah willard gibbss', 'josiah willard gibbs', 'josiah willards gibb', 'josiah willards gibbss', 'josiah willards gibbs', 'josiahs willard gibb', 'josiahs willard gibbss', 'josiahs willard gibbs', 'josiahs willards gibb', 'josiahs willards gibbss', 'josiahs willards gibbs'), ('exergonic reaction', 'exergonic reactions'), ('activation energy', 'activation energies'), ('chemical energy', 'chemical energies'), ('metabolism', 'metabolisms'), ('spontaneous reaction', 'spontaneous reactions'), ('energy of activation', 'energy of activation', 'energies of activation', 'energies of activation'), ('exergonic', 'exergonics'), ('heat energy', 'heat energies'), ('transition state', 'transition states'), ('energy change', 'energy changes'), ('endergonic reaction', 'endergonic reactions'), ('endergonic', 'endergonics'), ('gibb free energy', 'gibb free energies', 'gibbs free energy', 'gibbs free energies'), ('deltum g', 'deltum gs'), ('free energy', 'free energies')]"
28,stax-bio,6,Metabolism,3,m44424,The Laws of Thermodynamics,"thermodynamics refers to the study of energy and energy transfer involving physical matter. the matter and its environment relevant to a particular case of energy transfer are classified as a system, and everything outside of that system is called the surroundings. for instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water. energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). there are two types of systems: open and closed. an open system is one in which energy can be transferred between the system and its surroundings. the stovetop system is open because heat can be lost into the air. a closed system is one that cannot transfer energy to its surroundings. biological organisms are open systems. energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings, as they consume energy-storing molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work. like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to the laws of physics. the laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe. the first law of thermodynamics deals with the total amount of energy in the universe. it states that this total amount of energy is constant. in other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy in the universe. energy exists in many different forms. according to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may be transferred from place to place or transformed into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed. the transfers and transformations of energy take place around us all the time. light bulbs transform electrical energy into light energy. gas stoves transform chemical energy from natural gas into heat energy. plants perform one of the most biologically useful energy transformations on earth: that of converting the energy of sunlight into the chemical energy stored within organic molecules ([link]). some examples of energy transformations are shown in  [link]. the challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or transform into usable energy to do work. living cells have evolved to meet this challenge very well. chemical energy stored within organic molecules such as sugars and fats is transformed through a series of cellular chemical reactions into energy within molecules of atp. energy in atp molecules is easily accessible to do work. examples of the types of work that cells need to do include building complex molecules, transporting materials, powering the beating motion of cilia or flagella, contracting muscle fibers to create movement, and reproduction. a living cells primary tasks of obtaining, transforming, and using energy to do work may seem simple. however, the second law of thermodynamics explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. none of the energy transfers weve discussed, along with all energy transfers and transformations in the universe, is completely efficient. in every energy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. in most cases, this form is heat energy. thermodynamically, heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not doing work. for example, when an airplane flies through the air, some of the energy of the flying plane is lost as heat energy due to friction with the surrounding air. this friction actually heats the air by temporarily increasing the speed of air molecules. likewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions. this is good for warm-blooded creatures like us, because heat energy helps to maintain our body temperature. strictly speaking, no energy transfer is completely efficient, because some energy is lost in an unusable form. an important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder (also known as randomness). the more energy that is lost by a system to its surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is. scientists refer to the measure of randomness or disorder within a system as entropy. high entropy means high disorder and low energy ([link]). to better understand entropy, think of a students bedroom. if no energy or work were put into it, the room would quickly become messy. it would exist in a very disordered state, one of high entropy. energy must be put into the system, in the form of the student doing work and putting everything away, in order to bring the room back to a state of cleanliness and order. this state is one of low entropy. similarly, a car or house must be constantly maintained with work in order to keep it in an ordered state. left alone, the entropy of the house or car gradually increases through rust and degradation. molecules and chemical reactions have varying amounts of entropy as well. for example, as chemical reactions reach a state of equilibrium, entropy increases, and as molecules at a high concentration in one place diffuse and spread out, entropy also increases. set up a simple experiment to understand how energy is transferred and how a change in entropy results.  take a block of ice. this is water in solid form, so it has a high structural order. this means that the molecules cannot move very much and are in a fixed position. the temperature of the ice is 0c. as a result, the entropy of the system is low. allow the ice to melt at room temperature. what is the state of molecules in the liquid water now? how did the energy transfer take place? is the entropy of the system higher or lower? why? heat the water to its boiling point. what happens to the entropy of the system when the water is heated?  all physical systems can be thought of in this way: living things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to be maintained in a state of low entropy. as living systems take in energy-storing molecules and transform them through chemical reactions, they lose some amount of usable energy in the process, because no reaction is completely efficient. they also produce waste and by-products that arent useful energy sources. this process increases the entropy of the systems surroundings. since all energy transfers result in the loss of some usable energy, the second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe. even though living things are highly ordered and maintain a state of low entropy, the entropy of the universe in total is constantly increasing due to the loss of usable energy with each energy transfer that occurs. essentially, living things are in a continuous uphill battle against this constant increase in universal entropy. in studying energy, scientists use the term system to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers. everything outside of the system is called the surroundings. single cells are biological systems. systems can be thought of as having a certain amount of order. it takes energy to make a system more ordered. the more ordered a system is, the lower its entropy. entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. as a system becomes more disordered, the lower its energy and the higher its entropy become. a series of laws, called the laws of thermodynamics, describe the properties and processes of energy transfer. the first law states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. this means that energy cant be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. the second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form, such as heat energy, resulting in a more disordered system. in other words, no energy transfer is completely efficient and tends toward disorder.","[('energy system', 'energy systems'),

29,stax-bio,6,Metabolism,4,m44427,ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate,"even exergonic, energy-releasing reactions require a small amount of activation energy in order to proceed. however, consider endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input, because their products have more free energy than their reactants. within the cell, where does energy to power such reactions come from? the answer lies with an energy-supplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or atp. atp is a small, relatively simple molecule ([link]), but within some of its bonds, it contains the potential for a quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work. this molecule can be thought of as the primary energy currency of cells in much the same way that money is the currency that people exchange for things they need. atp is used to power the majority of energy-requiring cellular reactions. as its name suggests, adenosine triphosphate is comprised of adenosine bound to three phosphate groups ([link]). adenosine is a nucleoside consisting of the nitrogenous base adenine and a five-carbon sugar, ribose. the three phosphate groups, in order of closest to furthest from the ribose sugar, are labeled alpha, beta, and gamma. together, these chemical groups constitute an energy powerhouse. however, not all bonds within this molecule exist in a particularly high-energy state. both bonds that link the phosphates are equally high-energy bonds (phosphoanhydride bonds)  that, when broken, release sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes. these high-energy bonds are the bonds between the second and third (or beta and gamma) phosphate groups and between the first and second phosphate groups. the reason that these bonds are considered high-energy is because the products of such bond breakingadenosine diphosphate (adp) and one inorganic phosphate group (pi)have considerably lower free energy than the reactants: atp and a water molecule. because this reaction takes place with the use of a water molecule, it is considered a hydrolysis reaction. in other words, atp is hydrolyzed into adp in the following reaction: like most chemical reactions, the hydrolysis of atp to adp is reversible. the reverse reaction regenerates atp from adp + pi. indeed, cells rely on the regeneration of atp just as people rely on the regeneration of spent money through some sort of income. since atp hydrolysis releases energy, atp regeneration must require an input of free energy. the formation of atp is expressed in this equation: two prominent questions remain with regard to the use of atp as an energy source. exactly how much free energy is released with the hydrolysis of atp, and how is that free energy used to do cellular work? the calculated g  for the hydrolysis of one mole of atp into adp and pi is 7.3 kcal/mole (30.5 kj/mol). since this calculation is true under standard conditions, it would be expected that a different value exists under cellular conditions. in fact, the g  for the hydrolysis of one mole of atp in a living cell is almost double the value at standard conditions: 14 kcal/mol (57 kj/mol). atp is a highly unstable molecule. unless quickly used to perform work, atp spontaneously dissociates into adp + pi, and the free energy released during this process is lost as heat. the second question posed above, that is, how the energy released by atp hydrolysis is used to perform work inside the cell, depends on a strategy called energy coupling. cells couple the exergonic reaction of atp hydrolysis with endergonic reactions, allowing them to proceed. one example of energy coupling using atp involves a transmembrane ion pump that is extremely important for cellular function. this sodium-potassium pump (na+/k+ pump) drives sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell ([link]). a large percentage of a cells atp is spent powering this pump, because cellular processes bring a great deal of sodium into the cell and potassium out of the cell. the pump works constantly to stabilize cellular concentrations of sodium and potassium. in order for the pump to turn one cycle (exporting three na+ ions and importing two k+ ions), one molecule of atp must be hydrolyzed. when atp is hydrolyzed, its gamma phosphate doesnt simply float away, but is actually transferred onto the pump protein. this process of a phosphate group binding to a molecule is called phosphorylation. as with most cases of atp hydrolysis, a phosphate from atp is transferred onto another molecule. in a phosphorylated state, the na+/k+ pump has more free energy and is triggered to undergo a conformational change. this change allows it to release na+ to the outside of the cell. it then binds extracellular k+, which, through another conformational change, causes the phosphate to detach from the pump. this release of phosphate triggers the k+ to be released to the inside of the cell. essentially, the energy released from the hydrolysis of atp is coupled with the energy required to power the pump and transport na+ and k+ ions. atp performs cellular work using this basic form of energy coupling through phosphorylation. often during cellular metabolic reactions, such as the synthesis and breakdown of nutrients, certain molecules must be altered slightly in their conformation to become substrates for the next step in the reaction series. one example is during the very first steps of cellular respiration, when a molecule of the sugar glucose is broken down in the process of glycolysis. in the first step of this process, atp is required for the phosphorylation of glucose, creating a high-energy but unstable intermediate. this phosphorylation reaction powers a conformational change that allows the phosphorylated glucose molecule to be converted to the phosphorylated sugar fructose. fructose is a necessary intermediate for glycolysis to move forward. here, the exergonic reaction of atp hydrolysis is coupled with the endergonic reaction of converting glucose into a phosphorylated intermediate in the pathway. once again, the energy released by breaking a phosphate bond within atp was used for the phosphorylation of another molecule, creating an unstable intermediate and powering an important conformational change. atp is the primary energy-supplying molecule for living cells. atp is made up of a nucleotide, a five-carbon sugar, and three phosphate groups. the bonds that connect the phosphates (phosphoanhydride bonds) have high-energy content. the energy released from the hydrolysis of atp into adp + pi is used to perform cellular work. cells use atp to perform work by coupling the exergonic reaction of atp hydrolysis with endergonic reactions. atp donates its phosphate group to another molecule via a process known as phosphorylation. the phosphorylated molecule is at a higher-energy state and is less stable than its unphosphorylated form, and this added energy from the addition of the phosphate allows the molecule to undergo its endergonic reaction.","[('atp formation', 'atp formations'), ('energy currency', 'energy currencies'), ('cellular energy', 'cellular energies'), ('atp hydrolysi', 'atp hydrolyses', 'atp hydrolysis'), ('atp', 'atps'), ('sodium-potassium pump', 'sodium-potassium pumps'), ('phosphorylation', 'phosphorylations'), ('adenosine triphosphate', 'adenosine triphosphates'), ('metabolism', 'metabolisms')]"
30,stax-bio,6,Metabolism,5,m44429,Enzymes,"a substance that helps a chemical reaction to occur is a catalyst, and the special molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions are called enzymes. almost all enzymes are proteins, made up of chains of amino acids, and they perform the critical task of lowering the activation energies of chemical reactions inside the cell.  enzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules, and holding them in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and bond-forming processes take place more readily. it is important to remember that enzymes dont change the g  of a reaction. in other words, they dont change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic. this is because they dont change the free energy of the reactants or products. they only reduce the activation energy required to reach the transition state ([link]). the chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are the enzymes substrates. there may be one or more substrates, depending on the particular chemical reaction. in some reactions, a single-reactant substrate is broken down into multiple products. in others, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule. two reactants might also enter a reaction, both become modified, and leave the reaction as two products. the location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzymes active site. the active site is where the action happens, so to speak. since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid residues (also called side chains, or r groups) within the active site. each residue is characterized by different properties. residues can be large or small, weakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral. the unique combination of amino acid residues, their positions, sequences, structures, and properties, creates a very specific chemical environment within the active site. this specific environment is suited to bind, albeit briefly, to a specific chemical substrate (or substrates). due to this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates (which adapts to find the best fit between the transition state and the active site), enzymes are known for their specificity. the best fit results from the shape and the amino acid functional groups attraction to the substrate. there is a specifically matched enzyme for each substrate and, thus, for each chemical reaction; however, there is flexibility as well. the fact that active sites are so perfectly suited to provide specific environmental conditions also means that they are subject to influences by the local environment. it is true that increasing the environmental temperature generally increases reaction rates, enzyme-catalyzed or otherwise. however, increasing or decreasing the temperature outside of an optimal range can affect chemical bonds within the active site in such a way that they are less well suited to bind substrates. high temperatures will eventually cause enzymes, like other biological molecules, to denature, a process that changes the natural properties of a substance. likewise, the ph of the local environment can also affect enzyme function. active site amino acid residues have their own acidic or basic properties that are optimal for catalysis. these residues are sensitive to changes in ph that can impair the way substrate molecules bind. enzymes are suited to function best within a certain ph range, and, as with temperature, extreme ph values (acidic or basic) of the environment can cause enzymes to denature. for many years, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate binding took place in a simple lock-and-key fashion. this model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step. however, current research supports a more refined view called induced fit ([link]). the induced-fit model expands upon the lock-and-key model by describing a more dynamic interaction between enzyme and substrate. as the enzyme and substrate come together, their interaction causes a mild shift in the enzymes structure that confirms an ideal binding arrangement between the enzyme and the transition state of the substrate. this ideal binding maximizes the enzymes ability to catalyze its reaction. when an enzyme binds its substrate, an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. this complex lowers the activation energy of the reaction and promotes its rapid progression in one of many ways. on a basic level, enzymes promote chemical reactions that involve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an optimal orientation. the appropriate region (atoms and bonds) of one molecule is juxtaposed to the appropriate region of the other molecule with which it must react. another way in which enzymes promote the reaction of their substrates is by creating an optimal environment within the active site for the reaction to occur. certain chemical reactions might proceed best in a slightly acidic or non-polar environment. the chemical properties that emerge from the particular arrangement of amino acid residues within an active site create the perfect environment for an enzymes specific substrates to react. youve learned that the activation energy required for many reactions includes the energy involved in manipulating or slightly contorting chemical bonds so that they can easily break and allow others to reform. enzymatic action can aid this process. the enzyme-substrate complex can lower the activation energy by contorting substrate molecules in such a way as to facilitate bond-breaking, helping to reach the transition state. finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical reaction itself. the amino acid residues can provide certain ions or chemical groups that actually form covalent bonds with substrate molecules as a necessary step of the reaction process. in these cases, it is important to remember that the enzyme will always return to its original state at the completion of the reaction. one of the hallmark properties of enzymes is that they remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze. after an enzyme is done catalyzing a reaction, it releases its product(s). it would seem ideal to have a scenario in which all of the enzymes encoded in an organisms genome existed in abundant supply and functioned optimally under all cellular conditions, in all cells, at all times. in reality, this is far from the case. a variety of mechanisms ensure that this does not happen. cellular needs and conditions vary from cell to cell, and change within individual cells over time. the required enzymes and energetic demands of stomach cells are different from those of fat storage cells, skin cells, blood cells, and nerve cells. furthermore, a digestive cell works much harder to process and break down nutrients during the time that closely follows a meal compared with many hours after a meal. as these cellular demands and conditions vary, so do the amounts and functionality of different enzymes. since the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy, and enzymes lower and determine activation energies for chemical reactions, the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes within a cell ultimately determine which reactions will proceed and at which rates. this determination is tightly controlled. in certain cellular environments, enzyme activity is partly controlled by environmental factors, like ph and temperature. there are other mechanisms through which cells control the activity of enzymes and determine the rates at which various biochemical reactions will occur. enzymes can be regulated in ways that either promote or reduce their activity. there are many different kinds of molecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms exist for doing so. in some cases of enzyme inhibition, for example, an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding. when this happens, the enzyme is inhibited through competitive inhibition, because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for active site binding ([link]). on the other hand, in noncompetitive inhibition, an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than an allosteric site and still manages to block substrate binding to the active site. some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. this type of inhibition is called allosteric inhibition ([link]). most allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide, meaning that they have more than one protein subunit. when an allosteric inhibitor binds to an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits are changed slightly such that they bind their substrates with less efficiency. there are allosteric activators as well as inhibitors. allosteric activators bind to locations on an enzyme away from the active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzymes active site(s) for its substrate(s). drug discovery by looking for inhibitors of key enzymes in specific pathwaysenzymes are key components of metabolic pathways. understanding how enzymes work and how they can be regulated is a key principle behind the development of many of the pharmaceutical drugs ([link]) on the market today. biologists working in this field collaborate with other scientists, usually chemists, to design drugs. consider statins for examplewhich is the name given to the class of drugs that reduces cholesterol levels. these compounds are essentially inhibitors of the enzyme hmg-coa reductase. hmg-coa reductase is the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol from lipids in the body. by inhibiting this enzyme, the levels of cholesterol synthesized in the body can be reduced. similarly, acetaminophen, popularly marketed under the brand name tylenol, is an inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase. while it is effective in providing relief from fever and inflammation (pain), its mechanism of action is still not completely understood. how are drugs developed? one of the first challenges in drug development is identifying the specific molecule that the drug is intended to target. in the case of statins, hmg-coa reductase is the drug target. drug targets are identified through painstaking research in the laboratory. identifying the target alone is not sufficient; scientists also need to know how the target acts inside the cell and which reactions go awry in the case of disease. once the target and the pathway are identified, then the actual process of drug design begins. during this stage, chemists and biologists work together to design and synthesize molecules that can either block or activate a particular reaction. however, this is only the beginning: both if and when a drug prototype is successful in performing its function, then it must undergo many tests from in vitro experiments to clinical trials before it can get fda approval to be on the market. many enzymes dont work optimally, or even at all, unless bound to other specific non-protein helper molecules, either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds or permanently through stronger covalent bonds. two types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes. binding to these molecules promotes optimal conformation and function for their respective enzymes. cofactors are inorganic ions such as iron (fe++) and magnesium (mg++). one example of an enzyme that requires a metal ion as a cofactor is the enzyme that builds dna molecules, dna polymerase, which requires bound zinc ion (zn++) to function. coenzymes are organic helper molecules, with a basic atomic structure made up of carbon and hydrogen, which are required for enzyme action. the most common sources of coenzymes are dietary vitamins ([link]). some vitamins are precursors to coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes. vitamin c is a coenzyme for multiple enzymes that take part in building the important connective tissue component, collagen. an important step in the breakdown of glucose to yield energy is catalysis by a multi-enzyme complex called pyruvate dehydrogenase. pyruvate dehydrogenase is a complex of several enzymes that actually requires one cofactor (a magnesium ion) and five different organic coenzymes to catalyze its specific chemical reaction. therefore, enzyme function is, in part, regulated by an abundance of various cofactors and coenzymes, which are supplied primarily by the diets of most organisms. in eukaryotic cells, molecules such as enzymes are usually compartmentalized into different organelles. this allows for yet another level of regulation of enzyme activity. enzymes required only for certain cellular processes can be housed separately along with their substrates, allowing for more efficient chemical reactions. examples of this sort of enzyme regulation based on location and proximity include the enzymes involved in the latter stages of cellular respiration, which take place exclusively in the mitochondria, and the enzymes involved in the digestion of cellular debris and foreign materials, located within lysosomes. molecules can regulate enzyme function in many ways. a major question remains, however: what are these molecules and where do they come from? some are cofactors and coenzymes, ions, and organic molecules, as youve learned. what other molecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation, such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and noncompetitive inhibition? the answer is that a wide variety of molecules can perform these roles. some of these molecules include pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical drugs, toxins, and poisons from the environment. perhaps the most relevant sources of enzyme regulatory molecules, with respect to cellular metabolism, are the products of the cellular metabolic reactions themselves. in a most efficient and elegant way, cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity. feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further production ([link]). the cell responds to the abundance of specific products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions. such reaction products may inhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their production through the mechanisms described above. the production of both amino acids and nucleotides is controlled through feedback inhibition. additionally, atp is an allosteric regulator of some of the enzymes involved in the catabolic breakdown of sugar, the process that produces atp. in this way, when atp is abundant, the cell can prevent its further production. remember that atp is an unstable molecule that can spontaneously dissociate into adp. if too much atp were present in a cell, much of it would go to waste. on the other hand, adp serves as a positive allosteric regulator (an allosteric activator) for some of the same enzymes that are inhibited by atp. thus, when relative levels of adp are high compared to atp, the cell is triggered to produce more atp through the catabolism of sugar. enzymes are chemical catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions at physiological temperatures by lowering their activation energy. enzymes are usually proteins consisting of one or more polypeptide chains. enzymes have an active site that provides a unique chemical environment, made up of certain amino acid r groups (residues). this unique environment is perfectly suited to convert particular chemical reactants for that enzyme, called substrates, into unstable intermediates called transition states. enzymes and substrates are thought to bind with an induced fit, which means that enzymes undergo slight conformational adjustments upon substrate contact, leading to full, optimal binding. enzymes bind to substrates and catalyze reactions in four different ways: bringing substrates together in an optimal orientation, compromising the bond structures of substrates so that bonds can be more easily broken, providing optimal environmental conditions for a reaction to occur, or participating directly in their chemical reaction by forming transient covalent bonds with the substrates. enzyme action must be regulated so that in a given cell at a given time, the desired reactions are being catalyzed and the undesired reactions are not. enzymes are regulated by cellular conditions, such as temperature and ph. they are also regulated through their location within a cell, sometimes being compartmentalized so that they can only catalyze reactions under certain circumstances. inhibition and activation of enzymes via other molecules are other important ways that enzymes are regulated. inhibitors can act competitively, noncompetitively, or allosterically; noncompetitive inhibitors are usually allosteric. activators can also enhance the function of enzymes allosterically. the most common method by which cells regulate the enzymes in metabolic pathways is through feedback inhibition. during feedback inhibition, the products of a metabolic pathway serve as inhibitors (usually allosteric) of one or more of the enzymes (usually the first committed enzyme of the pathway) involved in the pathway that produces them.","[('enzyme active site', 'enzyme active sites', 'enzymes active site', 'enzymes active sites'), ('substrate

32,stax-bio,7,Cellular Respiration,1,m44431,Energy in Living Systems,"energy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways. most of these pathways are combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions. oxidation and reduction occur in tandem. an oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom in a compound, and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reaction. because oxidation and reduction usually occur together, these pairs of reactions are called oxidation reduction reactions, or redox reactions. the removal of an electron from a molecule, oxidizing it, results in a decrease in potential energy in the oxidized compound. the electron (sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom), does not remain unbonded, however, in the cytoplasm of a cell. rather, the electron is shifted to a second compound, reducing the second compound. the shift of an electron from one compound to another removes some potential energy from the first compound (the oxidized compound) and increases the potential energy of the second compound (the reduced compound). the transfer of electrons between molecules is important because most of the energy stored in atoms and used to fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons. the transfer of energy in the form of electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an incremental fashionin small packages rather than in a single, destructive burst. this chapter focuses on the extraction of energy from food; you will see that as you track the path of the transfers, you are tracking the path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways. in living systems, a small class of compounds functions as electron shuttles: they bind and carry high-energy electrons between compounds in pathways. the principal electron carriers we will consider are derived from the b vitamin group and are derivatives of nucleotides. these compounds can be easily reduced (that is, they accept electrons) or oxidized (they lose electrons). nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad) ([link]) is derived from vitamin b3, niacin. nad+ is the oxidized form of the molecule; nadh is the reduced form of the molecule after it has accepted two electrons and a proton (which together are the equivalent of a hydrogen atom with an extra electron). nad+ can accept electrons from an organic molecule according to the general equation: when electrons are added to a compound, they are reduced. a compound that reduces another is called a reducing agent. in the above equation, rh is a reducing agent, and nad+ is reduced to nadh. when electrons are removed from compound, it oxidized. a compound that oxidizes another is called an oxidizing agent. in the above equation, nad+ is an oxidizing agent, and rh is oxidized to r. similarly, flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad+) is derived from vitamin b2, also called riboflavin. its reduced form is fadh2. a second variation of nad, nadp, contains an extra phosphate group. both nad+ and fad+ are extensively used in energy extraction from sugars, and nadp plays an important role in anabolic reactions and photosynthesis. a living cell cannot store significant amounts of free energy. excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell, which would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell. rather, a cell must be able to handle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store energy safely and release it for use only as needed. living cells accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate (atp). atp is often called the energy currency of the cell, and, like currency, this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. how? it functions similarly to a rechargeable battery. when atp is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released. the energy is used to do work by the cell, usually by the released phosphate binding to another molecule, activating it. for example, in the mechanical work of muscle contraction, atp supplies the energy to move the contractile muscle proteins. recall the active transport work of the sodium-potassium pump in cell membranes. atp alters the structure of the integral protein that functions as the pump, changing its affinity for sodium and potassium. in this way, the cell performs work, pumping ions against their electrochemical gradients. at the heart of atp is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (amp), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to a ribose molecule and to a single phosphate group ([link]). ribose is a five-carbon sugar found in rna, and amp is one of the nucleotides in rna. the addition of a second phosphate group to this core molecule results in the formation of adenosine diphosphate (adp); the addition of a third phosphate group forms adenosine triphosphate (atp). the addition of a phosphate group to a molecule requires energy. phosphate groups are negatively charged and thus repel one another when they are arranged in series, as they are in adp and atp. this repulsion makes the adp and atp molecules inherently unstable. the release of one or two phosphate groups from atp, a process called dephosphorylation, releases energy. hydrolysis is the process of breaking complex macromolecules apart. during hydrolysis, water is split, or lysed, and the resulting hydrogen atom (h+) and a hydroxyl group (oh-) are added to the larger molecule. the hydrolysis of atp produces adp, together with an inorganic phosphate ion (pi), and the release of free energy. to carry out life processes, atp is continuously broken down into adp, and like a rechargeable battery, adp is continuously regenerated into atp by the reattachment of a third phosphate group. water, which was broken down into its hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group during atp hydrolysis, is regenerated when a third phosphate is added to the adp molecule, reforming atp. obviously, energy must be infused into the system to regenerate atp. where does this energy come from? in nearly every living thing on earth, the energy comes from the metabolism of glucose. in this way, atp is a direct link between the limited set of exergonic pathways of glucose catabolism and the multitude of endergonic pathways that power living cells. recall that, in some chemical reactions, enzymes may bind to several substrates that react with each other on the enzyme, forming an intermediate complex. an intermediate complex is a temporary structure, and it allows one of the substrates (such as atp) and reactants to more readily react with each other; in reactions involving atp, atp is one of the substrates and adp is a product. during an endergonic chemical reaction, atp forms an intermediate complex with the substrate and enzyme in the reaction. this intermediate complex allows the atp to transfer its third phosphate group, with its energy, to the substrate, a process called phosphorylation. phosphorylation refers to the addition of the phosphate (~p). this is illustrated by the following generic reaction: when the intermediate complex breaks apart, the energy is used to modify the substrate and convert it into a product of the reaction. the adp molecule and a free phosphate ion are released into the medium and are available for recycling through cell metabolism. atp is generated through two mechanisms during the breakdown of glucose. a few atp molecules are generated (that is, regenerated from adp) as a direct result of the chemical reactions that occur in the catabolic pathways. a phosphate group is removed from an intermediate reactant in the pathway, and the free energy of the reaction is used to add the third phosphate to an available adp molecule, producing atp ([link]). this very direct method of phosphorylation is called substrate-level phosphorylation. most of the atp generated during glucose catabolism, however, is derived from a much more complex process, chemiosmosis, which takes place in mitochondria ([link]) within a eukaryotic cell or the plasma membrane of a prokaryotic cell. chemiosmosis, a process of atp production in cellular metabolism, is used to generate 90 percent of the atp made during glucose catabolism and is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight. the production of atp using the process of chemiosmosis is called oxidative phosphorylation because of the involvement of oxygen in the process. what happens when the critical reactions of cellular respiration do not proceed correctly? mitochondrial diseases are genetic disorders of metabolism. mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial dna, and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells. in type 2 diabetes, for instance, the oxidation efficiency of nadh is reduced, impacting oxidative phosphorylation but not the other steps of respiration. symptoms of mitochondrial diseases can include muscle weakness, lack of coordination, stroke-like episodes, and loss of vision and hearing. most affected people are diagnosed in childhood, although there are some adult-onset diseases. identifying and treating mitochondrial disorders is a specialized medical field. the educational preparation for this profession requires a college education, followed by medical school with a specialization in medical genetics. medical geneticists can be board certified by the american board of medical genetics and go on to become associated with professional organizations devoted to the study of mitochondrial diseases, such as the mitochondrial medicine society and the society for inherited metabolic disease. atp functions as the energy currency for cells. it allows the cell to store energy briefly and transport it within the cell to support endergonic chemical reactions. the structure of atp is that of an rna nucleotide with three phosphates attached. as atp is used for energy, a phosphate group or two are detached, and either adp or amp is produced. energy derived from glucose catabolism is used to convert adp into atp. when atp is used in a reaction, the third phosphate is temporarily attached to a substrate in a process called phosphorylation. the two processes of atp regeneration that are used in conjunction with glucose catabolism are substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation through the process of chemiosmosis.","[('dephosphorylation', 'dephosphorylations'), ('nadh', 'nadhs'), ('chemisosmosi', 'chemisosmoses', 'chemisosmosis'), ('energy transfer', 'energy transfers'), ('hydrolysi', 'hydrolyses', 'hydrolysis'), ('substrate phosphorylation', 'substrate phosphorylations'), ('amp', 'amps'), ('oxidative phosphorylation', 'oxidative phosphorylations'), ('nadp', 'nadps'), ('fadh', 'fadhs'), ('energy', 'energies'), ('fad', 'fads'), ('redox reaction', 'redox reactions'), ('cellular respiration', 'cellular respirations'), ('phosphorylation', 'phosphorylations'), ('adenosine triphosphate', 'adenosine triphosphates'), ('phosphate group', 'phosphate groups'), ('atp', 'atps'), ('nad', 'nads'), ('mitochondrial disease', 'mitochondrial diseases'), ('metabolic pathway', 'metabolic pathways'), ('glucose metabolism', 'glucose metabolisms')]"
33,stax-bio,7,Cellular Respiration,2,m44432,Glycolysis,"you have read that nearly all of the energy used by living cells comes to them in the bonds of the sugar, glucose. glycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism. nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism. the process does not use oxygen and is therefore anaerobic. glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. glucose enters heterotrophic cells in two ways. one method is through secondary active transport in which the transport takes place against the glucose concentration gradient. the other mechanism uses a group of integral proteins called glut proteins, also known as glucose transporter proteins. these transporters assist in the facilitated diffusion of glucose. glycolysis begins with the six carbon ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-carbon sugar called pyruvate. glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. the first part of the glycolysis pathway traps the glucose molecule in the cell and uses energy to modify it so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into the two three-carbon molecules. the second part of glycolysis extracts energy from the molecules and stores it in the form of atp and nadh, the reduced form of nad. step 1. the first step in glycolysis ([link]) is catalyzed by hexokinase, an enzyme with broad specificity that catalyzes the phosphorylation of six-carbon sugars. hexokinase phosphorylates glucose using atp as the source of the phosphate, producing glucose-6-phosphate, a more reactive form of glucose. this reaction prevents the phosphorylated glucose molecule from continuing to interact with the glut proteins, and it can no longer leave the cell because the negatively charged phosphate will not allow it to cross the hydrophobic interior of the plasma membrane. step 2. in the second step of glycolysis, an isomerase converts glucose-6-phosphate into one of its isomers, fructose-6-phosphate. an isomerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule into one of its isomers. (this change from phosphoglucose to phosphofructose allows the eventual split of the sugar into two three-carbon molecules.). step 3. the third step is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. a second atp molecule donates a high-energy phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, producing fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. in this pathway, phosphofructokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme. it is active when the concentration of adp is high; it is less active when adp levels are low and the concentration of atp is high. thus, if there is sufficient atp in the system, the pathway slows down. this is a type of end product inhibition, since atp is the end product of glucose catabolism. step 4. the newly added high-energy phosphates further destabilize fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. the fourth step in glycolysis employs an enzyme, aldolase, to cleave 1,6-bisphosphate into two three-carbon isomers: dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. step 5. in the fifth step, an isomerase transforms the dihydroxyacetone-phosphate into its isomer, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. thus, the pathway will continue with two molecules of a single isomer. at this point in the pathway, there is a net investment of energy from two atp molecules in the breakdown of one glucose molecule. so far, glycolysis has cost the cell two atp molecules and produced two small, three-carbon sugar molecules. both of these molecules will proceed through the second half of the pathway, and sufficient energy will be extracted to pay back the two atp molecules used as an initial investment and produce a profit for the cell of two additional atp molecules and two even higher-energy nadh molecules. step 6. the sixth step in glycolysis ([link]) oxidizes the sugar (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), extracting high-energy electrons, which are picked up by the electron carrier nad+, producing nadh. the sugar is then phosphorylated by the addition of a second phosphate group, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. note that the second phosphate group does not require another atp molecule. here again is a potential limiting factor for this pathway. the continuation of the reaction depends upon the availability of the oxidized form of the electron carrier, nad+. thus, nadh must be continuously oxidized back into nad+ in order to keep this step going. if nad+ is not available, the second half of glycolysis slows down or stops. if oxygen is available in the system, the nadh will be oxidized readily, though indirectly, and the high-energy electrons from the hydrogen released in this process will be used to produce atp. in an environment without oxygen, an alternate pathway (fermentation) can provide the oxidation of nadh to nad+. step 7. in the seventh step, catalyzed by phosphoglycerate kinase (an enzyme named for the reverse reaction), 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate donates a high-energy phosphate to adp, forming one molecule of atp. (this is an example of substrate-level phosphorylation.) a carbonyl group on the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is oxidized to a carboxyl group, and 3-phosphoglycerate is formed. step 8. in the eighth step, the remaining phosphate group in 3-phosphoglycerate moves from the third carbon to the second carbon, producing 2-phosphoglycerate (an isomer of 3-phosphoglycerate). the enzyme catalyzing this step is a mutase (isomerase). step 9. enolase catalyzes the ninth step. this enzyme causes 2-phosphoglycerate to lose water from its structure; this is a dehydration reaction, resulting in the formation of a double bond that increases the potential energy in the remaining phosphate bond and produces phosphoenolpyruvate (pep). step 10. the last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase (the enzyme in this case is named for the reverse reaction of pyruvates conversion into pep) and results in the production of a second atp molecule by substrate-level phosphorylation and the compound pyruvic acid (or its salt form, pyruvate). many enzymes in enzymatic pathways are named for the reverse reactions, since the enzyme can catalyze both forward and reverse reactions (these may have been described initially by the reverse reaction that takes place in vitro, under non-physiological conditions). glycolysis starts with glucose and ends with two pyruvate molecules, a total of four atp molecules and two molecules of nadh. two atp molecules were used in the first half of the pathway to prepare the six-carbon ring for cleavage, so the cell has a net gain of two atp molecules and 2 nadh molecules for its use. if the cell cannot catabolize the pyruvate molecules further, it will harvest only two atp molecules from one molecule of glucose. mature mammalian red blood cells are not capable of aerobic respirationthe process in which organisms convert energy in the presence of oxygenand glycolysis is their sole source of atp. if glycolysis is interrupted, these cells lose their ability to maintain their sodium-potassium pumps, and eventually, they die. the last step in glycolysis will not occur if pyruvate kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of pyruvate, is not available in sufficient quantities. in this situation, the entire glycolysis pathway will proceed, but only two atp molecules will be made in the second half. thus, pyruvate kinase is a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis.	 glycolysis is the first pathway used in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy. it was probably one of the earliest metabolic pathways to evolve and is used by nearly all of the organisms on earth. glycolysis consists of two parts: the first part prepares the six-carbon ring of glucose for cleavage into two three-carbon sugars. atp is invested in the process during this half to energize the separation. the second half of glycolysis extracts atp and high-energy electrons from hydrogen atoms and attaches them to nad+. two atp molecules are invested in the first half and four atp molecules are formed by substrate phosphorylation during the second half. this produces a net gain of two atp and two nadh molecules for the cell.","[('phosphofructokinase', 'phosphofructokinases'), ('hexokinase', 'hexokinases'), ('pyruvate kinase', 'pyruvate kinases'), ('pyruvate', 'pyruvates'), ('glucose breakdown', 'glucose breakdowns'), ('aerobic respiration', 'aerobic respirations'), ('pyruvic acid', 'pyruvic acids'), ('isomerase', 'isomerases'), ('cellular respiration', 'cellular respirations'), ('aldolase', 'aldolases'), ('enolase', 'enolases'), ('glycolysi', 'glycolyses', 'glycolysis')]"
34,stax-bio,7,Cellular Respiration,3,m44433,Oxidation of Pyruvate and the Citric Acid Cycle,"if oxygen is available, aerobic respiration will go forward. in eukaryotic cells, the pyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolysis are transported into mitochondria, which are the sites of cellular respiration. there, pyruvate will be transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by a carrier compound called coenzyme a (coa). the resulting compound is called acetyl coa. coa is made from vitamin b5, pantothenic acid. acetyl coa can be used in a variety of ways by the cell, but its major function is to deliver the acetyl group derived from pyruvate to the next stage of the pathway in glucose catabolism. in order for pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, to enter the next pathway, it must undergo several changes. the conversion is a three-step process ([link]). step 1. a carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate, releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide into the surrounding medium. the result of this step is a two-carbon hydroxyethyl group bound to the enzyme (pyruvate dehydrogenase). this is the first of the six carbons from the original glucose molecule to be removed. this step proceeds twice (remember: there are two pyruvate molecules produced at the end of glycolsis) for every molecule of glucose metabolized; thus, two of the six carbons will have been removed at the end of both steps. step 2. the hydroxyethyl group is oxidized to an acetyl group, and the electrons are picked up by nad+, forming nadh. the high-energy electrons from nadh will be used later to generate atp. step 3. the enzyme-bound acetyl group is transferred to coa, producing a molecule of acetyl coa. note that during the second stage of glucose metabolism, whenever a carbon atom is removed, it is bound to two oxygen atoms, producing carbon dioxide, one of the major end products of cellular respiration. in the presence of oxygen, acetyl coa delivers its acetyl group to a four-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form citrate, a six-carbon molecule with three carboxyl groups; this pathway will harvest the remainder of the extractable energy from what began as a glucose molecule. this single pathway is called by different names: the citric acid cycle (for the first intermediate formedcitric acid, or citratewhen acetate joins to the oxaloacetate), the tca cycle (since citric acid or citrate and isocitrate are tricarboxylic acids), and the krebs cycle, after hans krebs, who first identified the steps in the pathway in the 1930s in pigeon flight muscles. like the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coa, the citric acid cycle takes place in the matrix of mitochondria. almost all of the enzymes of the citric acid cycle are soluble, with the single exception of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. unlike glycolysis, the citric acid cycle is a closed loop: the last part of the pathway regenerates the compound used in the first step. the eight steps of the cycle are a series of redox, dehydration, hydration, and decarboxylation reactions that produce two carbon dioxide molecules, one gtp/atp, and reduced forms of nadh and fadh2 ([link]). this is considered an aerobic pathway because the nadh and fadh2 produced must transfer their electrons to the next pathway in the system, which will use oxygen. if this transfer does not occur, the oxidation steps of the citric acid cycle also do not occur. note that the citric acid cycle produces very little atp directly and does not directly consume oxygen. step 1. prior to the start of the first step, a transitional phase occurs during which pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl coa. then, the first step of the cycle begins: this is a condensation step, combining the two-carbon acetyl group with a four-carbon oxaloacetate molecule to form a six-carbon molecule of citrate. coa is bound to a sulfhydryl group (-sh) and diffuses away to eventually combine with another acetyl group. this step is irreversible because it is highly exergonic. the rate of this reaction is controlled by negative feedback and the amount of atp available. if atp levels increase, the rate of this reaction decreases. if atp is in short supply, the rate increases. step 2. in step two, citrate loses one water molecule and gains another as citrate is converted into its isomer, isocitrate. step 3. in step three, isocitrate is oxidized, producing a five-carbon molecule, -ketoglutarate, together with a molecule of co2 and two electrons, which reduce nad+ to nadh. this step is also regulated by negative feedback from atp and nadh, and a positive effect of adp. steps 3 and 4. steps three and four are both oxidation and decarboxylation steps, which release electrons that reduce nad+ to nadh and release carboxyl groups that form co2  molecules. -ketoglutarate is the product of step three, and a succinyl group is the product of step four. coa binds the succinyl group to form succinyl coa. the enzyme that catalyzes step four is regulated by feedback inhibition of atp, succinyl coa, and nadh. step 5. in step five, a phosphate group is substituted for coenzyme a, and a high-energy bond is formed. this energy is used in substrate-level phosphorylation (during the conversion of the succinyl group to succinate) to form either guanine triphosphate (gtp) or atp. there are two forms of the enzyme, called isoenzymes, for this step, depending upon the type of animal tissue in which they are found. one form is found in tissues that use large amounts of atp, such as heart and skeletal muscle. this form produces atp. the second form of the enzyme is found in tissues that have a high number of anabolic pathways, such as liver. this form produces gtp. gtp is energetically equivalent to atp; however, its use is more restricted. in particular, protein synthesis primarily uses gtp. step 6. step six is a dehydration process that converts succinate into fumarate. two hydrogen atoms are transferred to fad, producing fadh2. the energy contained in the electrons of these atoms is insufficient to reduce nad+ but adequate to reduce fad. unlike nadh, this carrier remains attached to the enzyme and transfers the electrons to the electron transport chain directly. this process is made possible by the localization of the enzyme catalyzing this step inside the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. step 7. water is added to fumarate during step seven, and malate is produced. the last step in the citric acid cycle regenerates oxaloacetate by oxidizing malate. another molecule of nadh is produced in the process. two carbon atoms come into the citric acid cycle from each acetyl group, representing four out of the six carbons of one glucose molecule. two carbon dioxide molecules are released on each turn of the cycle; however, these do not necessarily contain the most recently added carbon atoms. the two acetyl carbon atoms will eventually be released on later turns of the cycle; thus, all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are eventually incorporated into carbon dioxide. each turn of the cycle forms three nadh molecules and one fadh2 molecule. these carriers will connect with the last portion of aerobic respiration to produce atp molecules. one gtp or atp is also made in each cycle. several of the intermediate compounds in the citric acid cycle can be used in synthesizing non-essential amino acids; therefore, the cycle is amphibolic (both catabolic and anabolic). in the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is transformed into an acetyl group attached to a carrier molecule of coenzyme a. the resulting acetyl coa can enter several pathways, but most often, the acetyl group is delivered to the citric acid cycle for further catabolism. during the conversion of pyruvate into the acetyl group, a molecule of carbon dioxide and two high-energy electrons are removed. the carbon dioxide accounts for two (conversion of two pyruvate molecules) of the six carbons of the original glucose molecule. the electrons are picked up by nad+, and the nadh carries the electrons to a later pathway for atp production. at this point, the glucose molecule that originally entered cellular respiration has been completely oxidized. chemical potential energy stored within the glucose molecule has been transferred to electron carriers or has been used to synthesize a few atps. the citric acid cycle is a series of redox and decarboxylation reactions that remove high-energy electrons and carbon dioxide. the electrons temporarily stored in molecules of nadh and fadh2 are used to generate atp in a subsequent pathway. one molecule of either gtp or atp is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation on each turn of the cycle. there is no comparison of the cyclic pathway with a linear one.","[('pyruvate oxidation', 'pyruvate oxidations'), ('krebs cycle', 'krebs cycles'), ('citric acid cycle', 'citric acid cycles', 'citric acids cycle', 'citric acids cycles'), ('linear pathway', 'linear pathways'), ('fumarate', 'fumarates'), ('succinyl coa', 'succinyl coas'), ('tca cycle', 'tca cycles'), ('acetyl coa', 'acetyl coas'), ('gtp', 'gtps'), ('coenzyme a', 'coenzyme some'), ('circular pathway', 'circular pathways'), ('cellular respiration', 'cellular respirations')]"
35,stax-bio,7,Cellular Respiration,4,m44437,Oxidative Phosphorylation,"you have just read about two pathways in glucose catabolismglycolysis and the citric acid cyclethat generate atp. most of the atp generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated directly from these pathways. rather, it is derived from a process that begins with moving electrons through a series of electron transporters that undergo redox reactions. this causes hydrogen ions to accumulate within the matrix space. therefore, a concentration gradient forms in which hydrogen ions diffuse out of the matrix space by passing through atp synthase. the current of hydrogen ions powers the catalytic action of atp synthase, which phosphorylates adp, producing atp. the electron transport chain ([link]) is the last component of aerobic respiration and is the only part of glucose metabolism that uses atmospheric oxygen. oxygen continuously diffuses into plants; in animals, it enters the body through the respiratory system. electron transport is a series of redox reactions that resemble a relay race or bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next, to the endpoint of the chain where the electrons reduce molecular oxygen, producing water. there are four complexes composed of proteins, labeled i through iv in  [link], and the aggregation of these four complexes, together with associated mobile, accessory electron carriers, is called the electron transport chain. the electron transport chain is present in multiple copies in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and the plasma membrane of prokaryotes. to start, two electrons are carried to the first complex aboard nadh. this complex, labeled i, is composed of flavin mononucleotide (fmn) and an iron-sulfur (fe-s)-containing protein. fmn, which is derived from vitamin b2, also called riboflavin, is one of several prosthetic groups or co-factors in the electron transport chain. a prosthetic group is a non-protein molecule required for the activity of a protein. prosthetic groups are organic or inorganic, non-peptide molecules bound to a protein that facilitate its function; prosthetic groups include co-enzymes, which are the prosthetic groups of enzymes. the enzyme in complex i is nadh dehydrogenase and is a very large protein, containing 45 amino acid chains. complex i can pump four hydrogen ions across the membrane from the matrix into the intermembrane space, and it is in this way that the hydrogen ion gradient is established and maintained between the two compartments separated by the inner mitochondrial membrane. complex ii directly receives fadh2, which does not pass through complex i. the compound connecting the first and second complexes to the third is ubiquinone (q). the q molecule is lipid soluble and freely moves through the hydrophobic core of the membrane. once it is reduced, (qh2), ubiquinone delivers its electrons to the next complex in the electron transport chain. q receives the electrons derived from nadh from complex i and the electrons derived from fadh2 from complex ii, including succinate dehydrogenase. this enzyme and fadh2 form a small complex that delivers electrons directly to the electron transport chain, bypassing the first complex. since these electrons bypass and thus do not energize the proton pump in the first complex, fewer atp molecules are made from the fadh2 electrons. the number of atp molecules ultimately obtained is directly proportional to the number of protons pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane. the third complex is composed of cytochrome b, another fe-s protein, rieske center (2fe-2s center), and cytochrome c proteins; this complex is also called cytochrome oxidoreductase. cytochrome proteins have a prosthetic group of heme. the heme molecule is similar to the heme in hemoglobin, but it carries electrons, not oxygen. as a result, the iron ion at its core is reduced and oxidized as it passes the electrons, fluctuating between different oxidation states: fe++ (reduced) and fe+++ (oxidized). the heme molecules in the cytochromes have slightly different characteristics due to the effects of the different proteins binding them, giving slightly different characteristics to each complex. complex iii pumps protons through the membrane and passes its electrons to cytochrome c for transport to the fourth complex of proteins and enzymes (cytochrome c is the acceptor of electrons from q; however, whereas q carries pairs of electrons, cytochrome c can accept only one at a time). the fourth complex is composed of cytochrome proteins c, a, and a3. this complex contains two heme groups (one in each of the two cytochromes, a, and a3) and three copper ions (a pair of cua and one cub in cytochrome a3). the cytochromes hold an oxygen molecule very tightly between the iron and copper ions until the oxygen is completely reduced. the reduced oxygen then picks up two hydrogen ions from the surrounding medium to make water (h2o). the removal of the hydrogen ions from the system contributes to the ion gradient used in the process of chemiosmosis. in chemiosmosis, the free energy from the series of redox reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions (protons) across the membrane. the uneven distribution of h+ ions across the membrane establishes both concentration and electrical gradients (thus, an electrochemical gradient), owing to the hydrogen ions positive charge and their aggregation on one side of the membrane. if the membrane were open to diffusion by the hydrogen ions, the ions would tend to diffuse back across into the matrix, driven by their electrochemical gradient. recall that many ions cannot diffuse through the nonpolar regions of phospholipid membranes without the aid of ion channels.  similarly, hydrogen ions in the matrix space can only pass through the inner mitochondrial membrane through an integral membrane protein called atp synthase ([link]). this complex protein acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it, down their electrochemical gradient. the turning of parts of this molecular machine facilitates the addition of a phosphate to adp, forming atp, using the potential energy of the hydrogen ion gradient. chemiosmosis ([link]) is used to generate 90 percent of the atp made during aerobic glucose catabolism; it is also the method used in the light reactions of photosynthesis to harness the energy of sunlight in the process of photophosphorylation. recall that the production of atp using the process of chemiosmosis in mitochondria is called oxidative phosphorylation. the overall result of these reactions is the production of atp from the energy of the electrons removed from hydrogen atoms. these atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule. at the end of the pathway, the electrons are used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions. the extra electrons on the oxygen attract hydrogen ions (protons) from the surrounding medium, and water is formed. the number of atp molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies. for example, the number of hydrogen ions that the electron transport chain complexes can pump through the membrane varies between species. another source of variance stems from the shuttle of electrons across the membranes of the mitochondria. (the nadh generated from glycolysis cannot easily enter mitochondria.) thus, electrons are picked up on the inside of mitochondria by either nad+ or fad+. as you have learned earlier, these fad+ molecules can transport fewer ions; consequently, fewer atp molecules are generated when fad+ acts as a carrier. nad+ is used as the electron transporter in the liver and fad+ acts in the brain. another factor that affects the yield of atp molecules generated from glucose is the fact that intermediate compounds in these pathways are used for other purposes. glucose catabolism connects with the pathways that build or break down all other biochemical compounds in cells, and the result is somewhat messier than the ideal situations described thus far. for example, sugars other than glucose are fed into the glycolytic pathway for energy extraction. moreover, the five-carbon sugars that form nucleic acids are made from intermediates in glycolysis. certain nonessential amino acids can be made from intermediates of both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, are also made from intermediates in these pathways, and both amino acids and triglycerides are broken down for energy through these pathways. overall, in living systems, these pathways of glucose catabolism extract about 34 percent of the energy contained in glucose. the electron transport chain is the portion of aerobic respiration that uses free oxygen as the final electron acceptor of the electrons removed from the intermediate compounds in glucose catabolism. the electron transport chain is composed of four large, multiprotein complexes embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and two small diffusible electron carriers shuttling electrons between them. the electrons are passed through a series of redox reactions, with a small amount of free energy used at three points to transport hydrogen ions across a membrane. this process contributes to the gradient used in chemiosmosis. the electrons passing through the electron transport chain gradually lose energy, high-energy electrons donated to the chain by either nadh or fadh2 complete the chain, as low-energy electrons reduce oxygen molecules and form water. the level of free energy of the electrons drops from about 60 kcal/mol in nadh or 45 kcal/mol in fadh2 to about 0 kcal/mol in water. the end products of the electron transport chain are water and atp. a number of intermediate compounds of the citric acid cycle can be diverted into the anabolism of other biochemical molecules, such as nonessential amino acids, sugars, and lipids. these same molecules can serve as energy sources for the glucose pathways.","[('electron transport chain', 'electron transport chains', 'electron transports chain', 'electron transports chains'), ('atp synthase', 'atp synthases'), ('ubiquinone', 'ubiquinones'), ('atp yield', 'atp yields'), ('complex iius', 'complex iiis', 'complex iii'), ('chemiosmosi', 'chemiosmoses', 'chemiosmosis'), ('oxidative phosphorylation', 'oxidative phosphorylations'), ('prosthetic', 'prosthetics'), ('cellular respiration', 'cellular respirations'), ('complex iv', 'complex ivs'), ('complex i', 'complex is'), ('complex ius', 'complex iis', 'complex ii')]"
36,stax-bio,7,Cellular Respiration,5,m44444,Metabolism without Oxygen,"in aerobic respiration, the final electron acceptor is an oxygen molecule, o2. if aerobic respiration occurs, then atp will be produced using the energy of high-energy electrons carried by nadh or fadh2 to the electron transport chain. if aerobic respiration does not occur, nadh must be reoxidized to nad+ for reuse as an electron carrier for the glycolytic pathway to continue. how is this done? some living systems use an organic molecule as the final electron acceptor. processes that use an organic molecule to regenerate nad+ from nadh are collectively referred to as fermentation. in contrast, some living systems use an inorganic molecule as a final electron acceptor. both methods are called anaerobic cellular respiration in which organisms convert energy for their use in the absence of oxygen. certain prokaryotes, including some species of bacteria and archaea, use anaerobic respiration. for example, the group of archaea called methanogens reduces carbon dioxide to methane to oxidize nadh. these microorganisms are found in soil and in the digestive tracts of ruminants, such as cows and sheep. similarly, sulfate-reducing bacteria and archaea, most of which are anaerobic ( [link]), reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide to regenerate nad+ from nadh. the fermentation method used by animals and certain bacteria, like those in yogurt, is lactic acid fermentation ( [link]). this type of fermentation is used routinely in mammalian red blood cells and in skeletal muscle that has an insufficient oxygen supply to allow aerobic respiration to continue (that is, in muscles used to the point of fatigue). in muscles, lactic acid accumulation must be removed by the blood circulation and the lactate brought to the liver for further metabolism. the chemical reactions of lactic acid fermentation are the following: the enzyme used in this reaction is lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). the reaction can proceed in either direction, but the reaction from left to right is inhibited by acidic conditions. such lactic acid accumulation was once believed to cause muscle stiffness, fatigue, and soreness, although more recent research disputes this hypothesis. once the lactic acid has been removed from the muscle and circulated to the liver, it can be reconverted into pyruvic acid and further catabolized for energy. another familiar fermentation process is alcohol fermentation ( [link]) that produces ethanol, an alcohol. the first chemical reaction of alcohol fermentation is the following (co2 does not participate in the second reaction): the first reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase, a cytoplasmic enzyme, with a coenzyme of thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp, derived from vitamin b1 and also called thiamine). a carboxyl group is removed from pyruvic acid, releasing carbon dioxide as a gas. the loss of carbon dioxide reduces the size of the molecule by one carbon, making acetaldehyde. the second reaction is catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase to oxidize nadh to nad+ and reduce acetaldehyde to ethanol. the fermentation of pyruvic acid by yeast produces the ethanol found in alcoholic beverages. ethanol tolerance of yeast is variable, ranging from about 5 percent to 21 percent, depending on the yeast strain and environmental conditions. other fermentation methods occur in bacteria. many prokaryotes are facultatively anaerobic. this means that they can switch between aerobic respiration and fermentation, depending on the availability of oxygen. certain prokaryotes, like clostridia, are obligate anaerobes. obligate anaerobes live and grow in the absence of molecular oxygen. oxygen is a poison to these microorganisms and kills them on exposure. it should be noted that all forms of fermentation, except lactic acid fermentation, produce gas. the production of particular types of gas is used as an indicator of the fermentation of specific carbohydrates, which plays a role in the laboratory identification of the bacteria. various methods of fermentation are used by assorted organisms to ensure an adequate supply of nad+ for the sixth step in glycolysis. without these pathways, that step would not occur and no atp would be harvested from the breakdown of glucose. if nadh cannot be oxidized through aerobic respiration, another electron acceptor is used. most organisms will use some form of fermentation to accomplish the regeneration of nad+, ensuring the continuation of glycolysis. the regeneration of nad+ in fermentation is not accompanied by atp production; therefore, the potential of nadh to produce atp using an electron transport chain is not utilized.","[('anaerobic cellular respiration', 'anaerobic cellular respirations'), ('fermentation', 'fermentations'), ('lactic acid fermentation', 'lactic acid fermentations', 'lactic acids fermentation', 'lactic acids fermentations'), ('lactate dehydrogenase', 'lactate dehydrogenases'), ('cellular respiration', 'cellular respirations'), ('metabolism without oxygen', 'metabolism without oxygens', 'metabolisms without oxygen', 'metabolisms without oxygens'), ('bacterial fermentation', 'bacterial fermentations'), ('alcohol fermentation', 'alcohol fermentations')]"
37,stax-bio,7,Cellular Respiration,6,m44441,"Connections of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Lipid Metabolic Pathways","you have learned about the catabolism of glucose, which provides energy to living cells. but living things consume more than glucose for food. how does a turkey sandwich end up as atp in your cells? this happens because all of the catabolic pathways for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids eventually connect into glycolysis and the citric acid cycle pathways (see  [link]). metabolic pathways should be thought of as porousthat is, substances enter from other pathways, and intermediates leave for other pathways. these pathways are not closed systems. many of the substrates, intermediates, and products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways. glycogen, a polymer of glucose, is an energy storage molecule in animals. when there is adequate atp present, excess glucose is shunted into glycogen for storage. glycogen is made and stored in both liver and muscle. the glycogen will be hydrolyzed into glucose monomers (g-1-p) if blood sugar levels drop. the presence of glycogen as a source of glucose allows atp to be produced for a longer period of time during exercise. glycogen is broken down into g-1-p and converted into g-6-p in both muscle and liver cells, and this product enters the glycolytic pathway. sucrose is a disaccharide with a molecule of glucose and a molecule of fructose bonded together with a glycosidic linkage. fructose is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose (which is part of the milk sugar, the disaccharide lactose), which are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. the catabolism of both fructose and galactose produces the same number of atp molecules as glucose. proteins are hydrolyzed by a variety of enzymes in cells. most of the time, the amino acids are recycled into the synthesis of new proteins. if there are excess amino acids, however, or if the body is in a state of starvation, some amino acids will be shunted into the pathways of glucose catabolism ([link]). each amino acid must have its amino group removed prior to entry into these pathways. the amino group is converted into ammonia. in mammals, the liver synthesizes urea from two ammonia molecules and a carbon dioxide molecule. thus, urea is the principal waste product in mammals produced from the nitrogen originating in amino acids, and it leaves the body in urine. the lipids that are connected to the glucose pathways are cholesterol and triglycerides. cholesterol is a lipid that contributes to cell membrane flexibility and is a precursor of steroid hormones. the synthesis of cholesterol starts with acetyl groups and proceeds in only one direction. the process cannot be reversed. triglycerides are a form of long-term energy storage in animals. triglycerides are made of glycerol and three fatty acids. animals can make most of the fatty acids they need. triglycerides can be both made and broken down through parts of the glucose catabolism pathways. glycerol can be phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate, which continues through glycolysis. fatty acids are catabolized in a process called beta-oxidation that takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria and converts their fatty acid chains into two carbon units of acetyl groups. the acetyl groups are picked up by coa to form acetyl coa that proceeds into the citric acid cycle. pathways of photosynthesis and cellular metabolismthe processes of photosynthesis and cellular metabolism consist of several very complex pathways. it is generally thought that the first cells arose in an aqueous environmenta soup of nutrientsprobably on the surface of some porous clays. if these cells reproduced successfully and their numbers climbed steadily, it follows that the cells would begin to deplete the nutrients from the medium in which they lived as they shifted the nutrients into the components of their own bodies. this hypothetical situation would have resulted in natural selection favoring those organisms that could exist by using the nutrients that remained in their environment and by manipulating these nutrients into materials upon which they could survive. selection would favor those organisms that could extract maximal value from the nutrients to which they had access. an early form of photosynthesis developed that harnessed the suns energy using water as a source of hydrogen atoms, but this pathway did not produce free oxygen (anoxygenic photosynthesis). (early photosynthesis did not produce free oxygen because it did not use water as the source of hydrogen ions; instead, it used materials like hydrogen sulfide and consequently produced sulfur). it is thought that glycolysis developed at this time and could take advantage of the simple sugars being produced, but these reactions were unable to fully extract the energy stored in the carbohydrates.  the development of glycolysis probably predated the evolution of photosynthesis, as it was well suited to extract energy from materials spontaneously accumulating in the primeval soup. a later form of photosynthesis used water as a source of electrons and hydrogen, and generated free oxygen. over time, the atmosphere became oxygenated, but not before the oxygen released oxidized metals in the ocean and created a rust layer in the sediment, permitting the dating of the rise of the first oxygenic photosynthesizers. living things adapted to exploit this new atmosphere that allowed aerobic respiration as we know it to evolve. when the full process of oxygenic photosynthesis developed and the atmosphere became oxygenated, cells were finally able to use the oxygen expelled by photosynthesis to extract considerably more energy from the sugar molecules using the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. the breakdown and synthesis of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids connect with the pathways of glucose catabolism. the simple sugars are galactose, fructose, glycogen, and pentose. these are catabolized during glycolysis. the amino acids from proteins connect with glucose catabolism through pyruvate, acetyl coa, and components of the citric acid cycle. cholesterol synthesis starts with acetyl groups, and the components of triglycerides come from glycerol-3-phosphate from glycolysis and acetyl groups produced in the mitochondria from pyruvate.","[('lipid metabolic pathway', 'lipid metabolic pathways', 'lipid metabolics pathway', 'lipid metabolics pathways'), ('cellular metabolism', 'cellular metabolisms'), ('protein metabolic pathway', 'protein metabolic pathways', 'protein metabolics pathway', 'protein metabolics pathways', 'proteins metabolic pathway', 'proteins metabolic pathways', 'proteins metabolics pathway', 'proteins metabolics pathways'), ('photosynthesi', 'photosyntheses', 'photosynthesis'), ('carbohydrate metabolic pathway', 'carbohydrate metabolic pathways', 'carbohydrate metabolics pathway', 'carbohydrate metabolics pathways', 'carbohydrates metabolic pathway', 'carbohydrates metabolic pathways', 'carbohydrates metabolics pathway', 'carbohydrates metabolics pathways'), ('cellular respiration', 'cellular respirations'), ('glycogen', 'glycogens'), ('glycolysi', 'glycolyses', 'glycolysis')]"
38,stax-bio,7,Cellular Respiration,7,m44442,Regulation of Cellular Respiration,"cellular respiration must be regulated in order to provide balanced amounts of energy in the form of atp. the cell also must generate a number of intermediate compounds that are used in the anabolism and catabolism of macromolecules.  without controls, metabolic reactions would quickly come to a stand still as the forward and backward reactions reached a state of equilibrium. resources would be used inappropriately. a cell does not need the maximum amount of atp that it can make all the time: at times, the cell needs to shunt some of the intermediates to pathways for amino acid, protein, glycogen, lipid, and nucleic acid production. in short, the cell needs to control its metabolism. a variety of mechanisms is used to control cellular respiration. some type of control exists at each stage of glucose metabolism. access of glucose to the cell can be regulated using the glut proteins that transport glucose ([link]). different forms of the glut protein control passage of glucose into the cells of specific tissues. some reactions are controlled by having two different enzymesone each for the two directions of a reversible reaction. reactions that are catalyzed by only one enzyme can go to equilibrium, stalling the reaction. in contrast, if two different enzymes (each specific for a given direction) are necessary for a reversible reaction, the opportunity to control the rate of the reaction increases, and equilibrium is not reached. a number of enzymes involved in each of the pathwaysin particular, the enzyme catalyzing the first committed reaction of the pathwayare controlled by attachment of a molecule to an allosteric site on the protein. the molecules most commonly used in this capacity are the nucleotides atp, adp, amp, nad+, and nadh. these regulators, allosteric effectors, may increase or decrease enzyme activity, depending on the prevailing conditions. the allosteric effector alters the steric structure of the enzyme, usually affecting the configuration of the active site. this alteration of the proteins (the enzymes) structure either increases or decreases its affinity for its substrate, with the effect of increasing or decreasing the rate of the reaction. the attachment signals to the enzyme. this binding can increase or decrease the enzymes activity, providing feedback. this feedback type of control is effective as long as the chemical affecting it is attached to the enzyme. once the overall concentration of the chemical decreases, it will diffuse away from the protein, and the control is relaxed. enzymes, proteins, electron carriers, and pumps that play roles in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain tend to catalyze non-reversible reactions. in other words, if the initial reaction takes place, the pathway is committed to proceeding with the remaining reactions. whether a particular enzyme activity is released depends upon the energy needs of the cell (as reflected by the levels of atp, adp, and amp). the control of glycolysis begins with the first enzyme in the pathway, hexokinase ([link]). this enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose, which helps to prepare the compound for cleavage in a later step. the presence of the negatively charged phosphate in the molecule also prevents the sugar from leaving the cell. when hexokinase is inhibited, glucose diffuses out of the cell and does not become a substrate for the respiration pathways in that tissue. the product of the hexokinase reaction is glucose-6-phosphate, which accumulates when a later enzyme, phosphofructokinase, is inhibited. phosphofructokinase is the main enzyme controlled in glycolysis. high levels of atp, citrate, or a lower, more acidic ph decrease the enzymes activity. an increase in citrate concentration can occur because of a blockage in the citric acid cycle. fermentation, with its production of organic acids like lactic acid, frequently accounts for the increased acidity in a cell; however, the products of fermentation do not typically accumulate in cells. the last step in glycolysis is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. the pyruvate produced can proceed to be catabolized or converted into the amino acid alanine. if no more energy is needed and alanine is in adequate supply, the enzyme is inhibited. the enzymes activity is increased when fructose-1,6-bisphosphate levels increase. (recall that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an intermediate in the first half of glycolysis.) the regulation of pyruvate kinase involves phosphorylation by a kinase (pyruvate kinase kinase), resulting in a less-active enzyme. dephosphorylation by a phosphatase reactivates it. pyruvate kinase is also regulated by atp (a negative allosteric effect). if more energy is needed, more pyruvate will be converted into acetyl coa through the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase. if either acetyl groups or nadh accumulate, there is less need for the reaction and the rate decreases. pyruvate dehydrogenase is also regulated by phosphorylation: a kinase phosphorylates it to form an inactive enzyme, and a phosphatase reactivates it. the kinase and the phosphatase are also regulated. the citric acid cycle is controlled through the enzymes that catalyze the reactions that make the first two molecules of nadh ([link]). these enzymes are isocitrate dehydrogenase and -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. when adequate atp and nadh levels are available, the rates of these reactions decrease. when more atp is needed, as reflected in rising adp levels, the rate increases. -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase will also be affected by the levels of succinyl coaa subsequent intermediate in the cyclecausing a decrease in activity. a decrease in the rate of operation of the pathway at this point is not necessarily negative, as the increased levels of the -ketoglutarate not used by the citric acid cycle can be used by the cell for amino acid (glutamate) synthesis. specific enzymes of the electron transport chain are unaffected by feedback inhibition, but the rate of electron transport through the pathway is affected by the levels of adp and atp. greater atp consumption by a cell is indicated by a buildup of adp. as atp usage decreases, the concentration of adp decreases, and now, atp begins to build up in the cell. this change is the relative concentration of adp to atp triggers the cell to slow down the electron transport chain.  for a summary of feedback controls in cellular respiration, see  [link]. cellular respiration is controlled by a variety of means. the entry of glucose into a cell is controlled by the transport proteins that aid glucose passage through the cell membrane. most of the control of the respiration processes is accomplished through the control of specific enzymes in the pathways. this is a type of negative feedback, turning the enzymes off. the enzymes respond most often to the levels of the available nucleosides atp, adp, amp, nad+, and fad. other intermediates of the pathway also affect certain enzymes in the systems.","[('electron transport chain', 'electron transport chains', 'electron transports chain', 'electron transports chains'), ('citric acid cycle', 'citric acid cycles', 'citric acids cycle', 'citric acids cycles'), ('feedback inhibition', 'feedback inhibitions'), ('insulin', 'insulins'), ('glycolysi regulation', 'glycolysi regulations'), ('regulation', 'regulations'), ('glut protein', 'glut proteins'), ('glucose', 'glucose'), ('cellular respiration', 'cellular respirations')]"

40,stax-bio,8,Photosynthesis,1,m44447,Overview of Photosynthesis,"photosynthesis is essential to all life on earth; both plants and animals depend on it. it is the only biological process that can capture energy that originates in outer space (sunlight) and convert it into chemical compounds (carbohydrates) that every organism uses to power its metabolism. in brief, the energy of sunlight is captured and used to energize electrons, which are then stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules. how long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds? the energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by photosynthesis almost 200 million years ago. plants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis ([link]). because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called photoautotrophs (literally, self-feeders using light). other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most other bacteria, are termed heterotrophs (other feeders), because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. a third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars, not by using sunlights energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds; hence, they are referred to as chemoautotrophs. the importance of photosynthesis is not just that it can capture sunlights energy. a lizard sunning itself on a cold day can use the suns energy to warm up. photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to store the energy in solar radiation (the photo- part) as high-energy electrons in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the -synthesis part). those carbohydrates are the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of atp via respiration. therefore, photosynthesis powers 99 percent of earths ecosystems. when a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer ([link]), the wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer, and finally to wolf. photosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires sunlight, carbon dioxide (which is low in energy), and water as substrates ([link]). after the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (ga3p), simple carbohydrate molecules (which are high in energy) that can subsequently be converted into glucose, sucrose, or any of dozens of other sugar molecules. these sugar molecules contain energy and the energized carbon that all living things need to survive. the following is the chemical equation for photosynthesis ([link]): although the equation looks simple, the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite complex. before learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures involved. in plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. the process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll. the gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. the stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes. in all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. for plants, chloroplast-containing cells exist in the mesophyll. chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane). within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids. embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a pigment (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. the thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen. as shown in [link], a stack of thylakoids is called a granum, and the liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or bed (not to be confused with stoma or mouth, an opening on the leaf epidermis). photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light independent-reactions. in the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. in the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drive the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use light as a reactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function. in addition, several enzymes of the light-independent reactions are activated by light. the light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store the energy: these are referred to as energy carriers. the energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent reactions to light-independent reactions can be thought of as full because they are rich in energy. after the energy is released, the empty energy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy. [link] illustrates the components inside the chloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place. photosynthesis at the grocery store major grocery stores in the united states are organized into departments, such as dairy, meats, produce, bread, cereals, and so forth. each aisle ([link]) contains hundreds, if not thousands, of different products for customers to buy and consume. although there is a large variety, each item links back to photosynthesis. meats and dairy link, because the animals were fed plant-based foods. the breads, cereals, and pastas come largely from starchy grains, which are the seeds of photosynthesis-dependent plants. what about desserts and drinks? all of these products contain sugarsucrose is a plant product, a disaccharide, a carbohydrate molecule, which is built directly from photosynthesis. moreover, many items are less obviously derived from plants: for instance, paper goods are generally plant products, and many plastics (abundant as products and packaging) are derived from algae. virtually every spice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf, root, bark, flower, fruit, or stem. ultimately, photosynthesis connects to every meal and every food a person consumes. the process of photosynthesis transformed life on earth. by harnessing energy from the sun, photosynthesis evolved to allow living things access to enormous amounts of energy. because of photosynthesis, living things gained access to sufficient energy that allowed them to build new structures and achieve the biodiversity evident today. only certain organisms, called photoautotrophs, can perform photosynthesis; they require the presence of chlorophyll, a specialized pigment that absorbs certain portions of the visible spectrum and can capture energy from sunlight. photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to assemble carbohydrate molecules and release oxygen as a waste product into the atmosphere. eukaryotic autotrophs, such as plants and algae, have organelles called chloroplasts in which photosynthesis takes place, and starch accumulates. in prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the process is less localized and occurs within folded membranes, extensions of the plasma membrane, and in the cytoplasm.","[('energy', 'energies'), ('photosynthesi', 'photosyntheses', 'photosynthesis'), ('stroma', 'stromas'), ('heterotroph', 'heterotrophs'), ('grana', 'granas'), ('photoautotroph', 'photoautotrophs'), ('mesophyll', 'mesophylls'), ('solar dependence', 'solar dependences'), ('chloroplast', 'chloroplasts'), ('light-dependent reaction', 'light-dependent reactions'), ('autotroph', 'autotrophs'), ('pigment', 'pigments'), ('thylakoid', 'thylakoids'), ('photosynthesi reactant', 'photosynthesi reactantss', 'photosynthesi reactants'), ('chemosynthetic organism', 'chemosynthetic organisms'), ('granum', 'granums'), ('chlorophyll', 'chlorophylls'), ('light-independent reaction', 'light-independent reactions'), ('photosynthesi product', 'photosynthesi productss', 'photosynthesi products'), ('food production', 'food productions'), ('stomatum', 'stomatas', 'stomata')]"
41,stax-bio,8,Photosynthesis,2,m44448,The Light-Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis,"how can light be used to make food? when a person turns on a lamp, electrical energy becomes light energy. like all other forms of kinetic energy, light can travel, change form, and be harnessed to do work. in the case of photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy, which photoautotrophs use to build carbohydrate molecules ([link]). however, autotrophs only use a few specific components of sunlight. the sun emits an enormous amount of electromagnetic radiation (solar energy). humans can see only a fraction of this energy, which portion is therefore referred to as visible light. the manner in which solar energy travels is described as waves. scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength, the distance between consecutive points of a wave. a single wave is measured from two consecutive points, such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough ([link]). visible light constitutes only one of many types of electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun and other stars. scientists differentiate the various types of radiant energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum. the electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of radiation ([link]). the difference between wavelengths relates to the amount of energy carried by them. each type of electromagnetic radiation travels at a particular wavelength. the longer the wavelength (or the more stretched out it appears in the diagram), the less energy is carried. short, tight waves carry the most energy. this may seem illogical, but think of it in terms of a piece of moving a heavy rope. it takes little effort by a person to move a rope in long, wide waves. to make a rope move in short, tight waves, a person would need to apply significantly more energy. the electromagnetic spectrum ([link]) shows several types of electromagnetic radiation originating from the sun, including x-rays and ultraviolet (uv) rays. the higher-energy waves can penetrate tissues and damage cells and dna, explaining why both x-rays and uv rays can be harmful to living organisms. light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light. organic pigments, whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb. energy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state. energy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching. so retinal pigments can only see (absorb) 700 nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light. for the same reasons, plants pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation. the visible light seen by humans as white light actually exists in a rainbow of colors. certain objects, such as a prism or a drop of water, disperse white light to reveal the colors to the human eye. the visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum shows the rainbow of colors, with violet and blue having shorter wavelengths, and therefore higher energy. at the other end of the spectrum toward red, the wavelengths are longer and have lower energy ([link]). different kinds of pigments exist, and each has evolved to absorb only certain wavelengths (colors) of visible light. pigments reflect or transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear in the corresponding color. chlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae; each class has multiple types of pigment molecules. there are five major chlorophylls: a, b, c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll. chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion. with dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. the carotenoids found in fruitsuch as the red of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (-carotene)are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers. in photosynthesis, carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. when a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage. therefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as heat. each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is the absorption spectrum. the graph in [link] shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and a type of carotenoid pigment called -carotene (which absorbs blue and green light). notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks and troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption. chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not green. because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green. carotenoids absorb in the short-wavelength blue region, and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths. many photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments; using them, the organism can absorb energy from a wider range of wavelengths. not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight. some organisms grow underwater where light intensity and quality decrease and change with depth. other organisms grow in competition for light. plants on the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees absorb most of the sunlight and scatter the remaining solar radiation ([link]). when studying a photosynthetic organism, scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption spectra. an instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a substance can absorb. spectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption. by extracting pigments from leaves and placing these samples into a spectrophotometer, scientists can identify which wavelengths of light an organism can absorb. additional methods for the identification of plant pigments include various types of chromatography that separate the pigments by their relative affinities to solid and mobile phases. the overall function of light-dependent reactions is to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of nadph and atp. this chemical energy supports the light-independent reactions and fuels the assembly of sugar molecules. the light-dependent reactions are depicted in [link]. protein complexes and pigment molecules work together to produce nadph and atp. the actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called a photosystem, two types of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane, photosystem ii (psii) and photosystem i (psi) ([link]). the two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize (that is, the source of the low-energy electron supply) and what they reduce (the place to which they deliver their energized electrons). both photosystems have the same basic structure; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place. each photosystem is serviced by the light-harvesting complex, which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids. the absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or packet of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state. in short, the light energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet. the energy is transferred from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until eventually (after about a millionth of a second), it is delivered to the reaction center. up to this point, only energy has been transferred between molecules, not electrons. the reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property. those two chlorophylls can undergo oxidation upon excitation; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact. it is at this step in the reaction center, this step in photosynthesis, that light energy is converted into an excited electron. all of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier nadph for delivery to the calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long-term storage in the form of a carbohydrate.psii and psi are two major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which also includes the cytochrome complex. the cytochrome complex, an enzyme composed of two protein complexes, transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone (pq) to the protein plastocyanin (pc), thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from psii to psi.
 the reaction center of psii (called p680) delivers its high-energy electrons, one at the time, to the primary electron acceptor, and through the electron transport chain (pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine) to psi. p680s missing electron is replaced by extracting a low-energy electron from water; thus, water is split and psii is re-reduced after every photoact. splitting one h2o molecule releases two electrons, two hydrogen atoms, and one atom of oxygen. splitting two molecules is required to form one molecule of diatomic o2 gas. about 10 percent of the oxygen is used by mitochondria in the leaf to support oxidative phosphorylation. the remainder escapes to the atmosphere where it is used by aerobic organisms to support respiration. as electrons move through the proteins that reside between psii and psi, they lose energy. that energy is used to move hydrogen atoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen. those hydrogen atoms, plus the ones produced by splitting water, accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used synthesize atp in a later step. because the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at psi, they must be re-energized by psi, hence, another photon is absorbed by the psi antenna. that energy is relayed to the psi reaction center (called p700). p700 is oxidized and sends a high-energy electron to nadp+ to form nadph. thus, psii captures the energy to create proton gradients to make atp, and psi captures the energy to reduce nadp+ into nadph. the two photosystems work in concert, in part, to guarantee that the production of nadph will roughly equal the production of atp. other mechanisms exist to fine tune that ratio to exactly match the chloroplasts constantly changing energy needs. as in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration, the buildup of hydrogen ions inside the thylakoid lumen creates a concentration gradient. the passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high concentration (in the thylakoid lumen) to low concentration (in the stroma) is harnessed to create atp, just as in the electron transport chain of cellular respiration. the ions build up energy because of diffusion and because they all have the same electrical charge, repelling each other. to release this energy, hydrogen ions will rush through any opening, similar to water jetting through a hole in a dam. in the thylakoid, that opening is a passage through a specialized protein channel called the atp synthase. the energy released by the hydrogen ion stream allows atp synthase to attach a third phosphate group to adp, which forms a molecule of atp ([link]). the flow of hydrogen ions through atp synthase is called chemiosmosis because the ions move from an area of high to an area of low concentration through a semi-permeable structure. the pigments of the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions, absorb energy from sunlight. a photon strikes the antenna pigments of photosystem ii to initiate photosynthesis. the energy travels to the reaction center that contains chlorophyll a to the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid interior. this action builds up a high concentration of ions. the ions flow through atp synthase via chemiosmosis to form molecules of atp, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. photosystem i absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an nadph molecule, another energy and reducing power carrier for the light-independent reactions.","[('photosystem i', 'photosystem is'), ('antenna molecule', 'antenna molecules'), ('absorption spectrum', 'absorption spectra'), ('absorption', 'absorptions'), ('photon', 'photons'), ('electromagnetic spectrum', 'electromagnetic spectra'), ('light-dependent reaction', 'light-dependent reactions'), ('chlorophyll b', 'chlorophyll bs'), ('electron transport chain', 'electron transport chains', 'electron transports chain', 'electron transports chains'), ('nadp', 'nadps'), ('reaction center', 'reaction centers'), ('atp', 'atps'), ('light wavelength', 'light wavelengthss', 'light wavelengths'), ('light energy', 'light energies'), ('photosystem ius', 'photosystem iis', 'photosystem ii'), ('nadph', 'nadphs'), ('pigment', 'pigments'), ('primary electron acceptor', 'primary electron acceptors', 'primary electrons acceptor', 'primary electrons acceptors'), ('chlorophyll a', 'chlorophyll some'), ('adp', 'adps'), ('cytochrome complex', 'cytochrome complexes'), ('visible light', 'visible lights'), ('photosynthesi', 'photosyntheses', 'photosynthesis'), ('wavelength', 'wavelengths')]"
42,stax-bio,8,Photosynthesis,3,m44449,Using Light Energy to Make Organic Molecules,"after the energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy and temporarily stored in atp and nadph molecules, the cell has the fuel needed to build carbohydrate molecules for long-term energy storage. the products of the light-dependent reactions, atp and nadph, have lifespans in the range of millionths of seconds, whereas the products of the light-independent reactions (carbohydrates and other forms of reduced carbon) can survive for hundreds of millions of years. the carbohydrate molecules made will have a backbone of carbon atoms. where does the carbon come from? it comes from carbon dioxide, the gas that is a waste product of respiration in microbes, fungi, plants, and animals. in plants, carbon dioxide (co2) enters the leaves through stomata, where it diffuses over short distances through intercellular spaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells. once in the mesophyll cells, co2 diffuses into the stroma of the chloroplastthe site of light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. these reactions actually have several names associated with them. another term, the calvin cycle, is named for the man who discovered it, and because these reactions function as a cycle. others call it the calvin-benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery. the most outdated name is dark reactions, because light is not directly required ([link]). however, the term dark reaction can be misleading because it implies incorrectly that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light, which is why most scientists and instructors no longer use it. the light-independent reactions of the calvin cycle can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and regeneration. in the stroma, in addition to co2, two other components are present to initiate the light-independent reactions: an enzyme called ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), and three molecules of ribulose bisphosphate (rubp), as shown in [link]. rubp has five atoms of carbon, flanked by two phosphates. rubisco catalyzes a reaction between co2 and rubp. for each co2 molecule that reacts with one rubp, two molecules of another compound (3-pga) form. pga has three carbons and one phosphate. each turn of the cycle involves only one rubp and one carbon dioxide and forms two molecules of 3-pga. the number of carbon atoms remains the same, as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions (3 atoms from 3co2 + 15 atoms from 3rubp = 18 atoms in 3 atoms of 3-pga). this process is called carbon fixation, because co2 is fixed from an inorganic form into organic molecules. atp and nadph are used to convert the six molecules of 3-pga into six molecules of a chemical called glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (g3p). that is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-pga. recall that a reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule. six molecules of both atp and nadph are used. for atp, energy is released with the loss of the terminal phosphate atom, converting it into adp; for nadph, both energy and a hydrogen atom are lost, converting it into nadp+. both of these molecules return to the nearby light-dependent reactions to be reused and reenergized. interestingly, at this point, only one of the g3p molecules leaves the calvin cycle and is sent to the cytoplasm to contribute to the formation of other compounds needed by the plant. because the g3p exported from the chloroplast has three carbon atoms, it takes three turns of the calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one g3p. but each turn makes two g3ps, thus three turns make six g3ps. one is exported while the remaining five g3p molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate rubp, which enables the system to prepare for more co2 to be fixed. three more molecules of atp are used in these regeneration reactions. photosynthesisduring the evolution of photosynthesis, a major shift occurred from the bacterial type of photosynthesis that involves only one photosystem and is typically anoxygenic (does not generate oxygen) into modern oxygenic (does generate oxygen) photosynthesis, employing two photosystems. this modern oxygenic photosynthesis is used by many organismsfrom giant tropical leaves in the rainforest to tiny cyanobacterial cellsand the process and components of this photosynthesis remain largely the same. photosystems absorb light and use electron transport chains to convert energy into the chemical energy of atp and nadh. the subsequent light-independent reactions then assemble carbohydrate molecules with this energy. photosynthesis in desert plants has evolved adaptations that conserve water. in the harsh dry heat, every drop of water must be used to survive. because stomata must open to allow for the uptake of co2, water escapes from the leaf during active photosynthesis. desert plants have evolved processes to conserve water and deal with harsh conditions. a more efficient use of co2 allows plants to adapt to living with less water. some plants such as cacti ([link]) can prepare materials for photosynthesis during the night by a temporary carbon fixation/storage process, because opening the stomata at this time conserves water due to cooler temperatures. in addition, cacti have evolved the ability to carry out low levels of photosynthesis without opening stomata at all, an extreme mechanism to face extremely dry periods. whether the organism is a bacterium, plant, or animal, all living things access energy by breaking down carbohydrate molecules. but if plants make carbohydrate molecules, why would they need to break them down, especially when it has been shown that the gas organisms release as a waste product (co2) acts as a substrate for the formation of more food in photosynthesis? remember, living things need energy to perform life functions. in addition, an organism can either make its own food or eat another organismeither way, the food still needs to be broken down. finally, in the process of breaking down food, called cellular respiration, heterotrophs release needed energy and produce waste in the form of co2 gas. in nature, there is no such thing as waste. every single atom of matter and energy is conserved, recycling over and over infinitely. substances change form or move from one type of molecule to another, but their constituent atoms never disappear ([link]). co2 is no more a form of waste than oxygen is wasteful to photosynthesis. both are byproducts of reactions that move on to other reactions. photosynthesis absorbs light energy to build carbohydrates
in chloroplasts, and aerobic cellular respiration releases energy by using oxygen to metabolize carbohydrates in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. both processes use electron transport chains to capture the energy necessary to drive other reactions. these two powerhouse processes, photosynthesis and cellular respiration, function in biological, cyclical harmony to allow organisms to access life-sustaining energy that originates millions of miles away in a burning star humans call the sun. using the energy carriers formed in the first steps of photosynthesis, the light-independent reactions, or the calvin cycle, take in co2 from the environment. an enzyme, rubisco, catalyzes a reaction with co2 and another molecule, rubp. after three cycles, a three-carbon molecule of g3p leaves the cycle to become part of a carbohydrate molecule. the remaining g3p molecules stay in the cycle to be regenerated into rubp, which is then ready to react with more co2. photosynthesis forms an energy cycle with the process of cellular respiration. plants need both photosynthesis and respiration for their ability to function in both the light and dark, and to be able to interconvert essential metabolites. therefore, plants contain both chloroplasts and mitochondria.","[('rubp', 'rubps'), ('photosynthesi', 'photosyntheses', 'photosynthesis'), ('calvin cycle', 'calvin cycles'), ('energy cycle', 'energy cycles'), ('rubisco', 'rubiscoes'), ('organic molecule', 'organic molecules'), ('prokaryote', 'prokaryotes'), ('dark reaction', 'dark reactions'), ('reduction', 'reductions'), ('calvin-benson cycle', 'calvin-benson cycles'), ('fixation', 'fixations'), ('regeneration', 'regenerations'), ('carbon fixation', 'carbon fixations')]"

44,stax-bio,9,Cell Communication,1,m44451,Signaling Molecules and Cellular Receptors,"there are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells. communication between cells is called intercellular signaling, and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling. an easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the latin origin of the prefixes: inter- means ""between"" (for example, intersecting lines are those that cross each other) and intra- means ""inside"" (like intravenous). chemical signals are released by signaling cells in the form of small, usually volatile or soluble molecules called ligands. a ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule, in some cases, delivering a signal in the process. ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules. ligands interact with proteins in target cells, which are cells that are affected by chemical signals; these proteins are also called receptors. ligands and receptors exist in several varieties; however, a specific ligand will have a specific receptor that typically binds only that ligand. there are four categories of chemical signaling found in multicellular organisms: paracrine signaling, endocrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions ([link]). the main difference between the different categories of signaling is the distance that the signal travels through the organism to reach the target cell. not all cells are affected by the same signals. signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals. paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix. these types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short amount of time. in order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by neighboring cells. removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again. one example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. a nerve cell consists of a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. the junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse. a synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. when these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). the neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which are called chemical synapses ([link]). the small distance between nerve cells allows the signal to travel quickly; this enables an immediate response, such as, take your hand off the stove! when the neurotransmitter binds the receptor on the surface of the postsynaptic cell, the electrochemical potential of the target cell changes, and the next electrical impulse is launched. the neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal. signals from distant cells are called endocrine signals, and they originate from endocrine cells. (in the body, many endocrine cells are located in endocrine glands, such as the thyroid gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland.) these types of signals usually produce a slower response but have a longer-lasting effect. the ligands released in endocrine signaling are called hormones, signaling molecules that are produced in one part of the body but affect other body regions some distance away. hormones travel the large distances between endocrine cells and their target cells via the bloodstream, which is a relatively slow way to move throughout the body. because of their form of transport, hormones get diluted and are present in low concentrations when they act on their target cells. this is different from paracrine signaling, in which local concentrations of ligands can be very high. autocrine signals are produced by signaling cells that can also bind to the ligand that is released. this means the signaling cell and the target cell can be the same or a similar cell (the prefix auto- means self, a reminder that the signaling cell sends a signal to itself). this type of signaling often occurs during the early development of an organism to ensure that cells develop into the correct tissues and take on the proper function. autocrine signaling also regulates pain sensation and inflammatory responses.  further, if a cell is infected with a virus, the cell can signal itself to undergo programmed cell death, killing the virus in the process. in some cases, neighboring cells of the same type are also influenced by the released ligand. in embryological development, this process of stimulating a group of neighboring cells may help to direct the differentiation of identical cells into the same cell type, thus ensuring the proper developmental outcome. gap junctions in animals and plasmodesmata in plants are connections between the plasma membranes of neighboring cells. these water-filled channels allow small signaling molecules, called intracellular mediators, to diffuse between the two cells. small molecules, such as calcium ions (ca2+), are able to move between cells, but large molecules like proteins and dna cannot fit through the channels. the specificity of the channels ensures that the cells remain independent but can quickly and easily transmit signals. the transfer of signaling molecules communicates the current state of the cell that is directly next to the target cell; this allows a group of cells to coordinate their response to a signal that only one of them may have received. in plants, plasmodesmata are ubiquitous, making the entire plant into a giant, communication network. receptors are protein molecules in the target cell or on its surface that bind ligand. there are two types of receptors, internal receptors and cell-surface receptors. internal receptors, also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors, are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond to hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane. once inside the cell, many of these molecules bind to proteins that act as regulators of mrna synthesis (transcription) to mediate gene expression. gene expression is the cellular process of transforming the information in a cell's dna into a sequence of amino acids, which ultimately forms a protein. when the ligand binds to the internal receptor, a conformational change is triggered that exposes a dna-binding site on the protein. the ligand-receptor complex moves into the nucleus, then binds to specific regulatory regions of the chromosomal dna and promotes the initiation of transcription ([link]). transcription is the process of copying the information in a cells dna into a special form of rna called messenger rna (mrna); the cell uses information in the mrna (which moves out into the cytoplasm and associates with ribosomes) to link specific amino acids in the correct order, producing a protein.  internal receptors can directly influence gene expression without having to pass the signal on to other receptors or messengers. cell-surface receptors, also known as transmembrane receptors, are cell surface, membrane-anchored (integral) proteins that bind to external ligand molecules. this type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction, in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intercellular signal. ligands that interact with cell-surface receptors do not have to enter the cell that they affect. cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because they are specific to individual cell types. because cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a malfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences. errors in the protein structures of certain receptor molecules have been shown to play a role in hypertension (high blood pressure), asthma, heart disease, and cancer. each cell-surface receptor has three main components: an external ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning region, and an intracellular domain inside the cell. the ligand-binding domain is also called the extracellular domain. the size and extent of each of these domains vary widely, depending on the type of receptor. how viruses recognize a hostunlike living cells, many viruses do not have a plasma membrane or any of the structures necessary to sustain life. some viruses are simply composed of an inert protein shell containing dna or rna. to reproduce, viruses must invade a living cell, which serves as a host, and then take over the hosts cellular apparatus. but how does a virus recognize its host? viruses often bind to cell-surface receptors on the host cell. for example, the virus that causes human influenza (flu) binds specifically to receptors on membranes of cells of the respiratory system. chemical differences in the cell-surface receptors among hosts mean that a virus that infects a specific species (for example, humans) cannot infect another species (for example, chickens). however, viruses have very small amounts of dna or rna compared to humans, and, as a result, viral reproduction can occur rapidly. viral reproduction invariably produces errors that can lead to changes in newly produced viruses; these changes mean that the viral proteins that interact with cell-surface receptors may evolve in such a way that they can bind to receptors in a new host. such changes happen randomly and quite often in the reproductive cycle of a virus, but the changes only matter if a virus with new binding properties comes into contact with a suitable host. in the case of influenza, this situation can occur in settings where animals and people are in close contact, such as poultry and swine farms.1 once a virus jumps to a new host, it can spread quickly. scientists watch newly appearing viruses (called emerging viruses) closely in the hope that such monitoring can reduce the likelihood of global viral epidemics. cell-surface receptors are involved in most of the signaling in multicellular organisms. there are three general categories of cell-surface receptors: ion channel-linked receptors, g-protein-linked receptors, and enzyme-linked receptors. ion channel-linked receptors bind a ligand and open a channel through the membrane that allows specific ions to pass through. to form a channel, this type of cell-surface receptor has an extensive membrane-spanning region. in order to interact with the phospholipid fatty acid tails that form the center of the plasma membrane, many of the amino acids in the membrane-spanning region are hydrophobic in nature. conversely, the amino acids that line the inside of the channel are hydrophilic to allow for the passage of water or ions. when a ligand binds to the extracellular region of the channel, there is a conformational change in the proteins structure that allows ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen to pass through ([link]). g-protein-linked receptors bind a ligand and activate a membrane protein called a g-protein. the activated g-protein then interacts with either an ion channel or an enzyme in the membrane ([link]). all g-protein-linked receptors have seven transmembrane domains, but each receptor has its own specific extracellular domain and g-protein-binding site. cell signaling using g-protein-linked receptors occurs as a cyclic series of events. before the ligand binds, the inactive g-protein can bind to a newly revealed site on the receptor specific for its binding. once the g-protein binds to the receptor, the resultant shape change activates the g-protein, which releases gdp and picks up gtp.  the subunits of the g-protein then split into the  subunit and the  subunit.  one or both of these g-protein fragments may be able to activate other proteins as a result.  after awhile, the gtp on the active  subunit of the g-protein is hydrolyzed to gdp and the  subunit is deactivated.  the subunits reassociate to form the inactive g-protein and the cycle begins anew. g-protein-linked receptors have been extensively studied and much has been learned about their roles in maintaining health. bacteria that are pathogenic to humans can release poisons that interrupt specific g-protein-linked receptor function, leading to illnesses such as pertussis, botulism, and cholera. in cholera ([link]), for example, the water-borne bacterium vibrio cholerae produces a toxin, choleragen, that binds to cells lining the small intestine. the toxin then enters these intestinal cells, where it modifies a g-protein that controls the opening of a chloride channel and causes it to remain continuously active, resulting in large losses of fluids from the body and potentially fatal dehydration as a result. enzyme-linked receptors are cell-surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme. in some cases, the intracellular domain of the receptor itself is an enzyme. other enzyme-linked receptors have a small intracellular domain that interacts directly with an enzyme. the enzyme-linked receptors normally have large extracellular and intracellular domains, but the membrane-spanning region consists of a single alpha-helical region of the peptide strand. when a ligand binds to the extracellular domain, a signal is transferred through the membrane, activating the enzyme. activation of the enzyme sets off a chain of events within the cell that eventually leads to a response.  one example of this type of enzyme-linked receptor is the tyrosine kinase receptor ([link]). a kinase is an enzyme that  transfers phosphate groups from atp to another protein. the tyrosine kinase receptor transfers phosphate groups to tyrosine molecules (tyrosine residues). first, signaling molecules bind to the extracellular domain of two nearby tyrosine kinase receptors. the two neighboring receptors then bond together, or dimerize. phosphates are then added to tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of the receptors (phosphorylation). the phosphorylated residues can then transmit the signal to the next messenger within the cytoplasm. produced by signaling cells and the subsequent binding to receptors in target cells, ligands act as chemical signals that travel to the target cells to coordinate responses. the types of molecules that serve as ligands are incredibly varied and range from small proteins to small ions like calcium (ca2+). small hydrophobic ligands can directly diffuse through the plasma membrane and interact with internal receptors. important members of this class of ligands are the steroid hormones. steroids are lipids that have a hydrocarbon skeleton with four fused rings; different steroids have different functional groups attached to the carbon skeleton. steroid hormones include the female sex hormone, estradiol, which is a type of estrogen; the male sex hormone, testosterone; and cholesterol, which is an important structural component of biological membranes and a precursor of steriod hormones ([link]). other hydrophobic hormones include thyroid hormones and vitamin d. in order to be soluble in blood, hydrophobic ligands must bind to carrier proteins while they are being transported through the bloodstream. water-soluble ligands are polar and therefore cannot pass through the plasma membrane unaided; sometimes, they are too large to pass through the membrane at all. instead, most water-soluble ligands bind to the extracellular domain of cell-surface receptors. this group of ligands is quite diverse and includes small molecules, peptides, and proteins. nitric oxide (no) is a gas that also acts as a ligand. it is able to diffuse directly across the plasma membrane, and one of its roles is to interact with receptors in smooth muscle and induce relaxation of the tissue. no has a very short half-life and therefore only functions over short distances. nitroglycerin, a treatment for heart disease, acts by triggering the release of no, which causes blood vessels to dilate (expand), thus restoring blood flow to the heart. no has become better known recently because the pathway that it affects is targeted by prescription medications for erectile dysfunction, such as viagra (erection involves dilated blood vessels). cells communicate by both inter- and intracellular signaling. signaling cells secrete ligands that bind to target cells and initiate a chain of events within the target cell. the four categories of signaling in multicellular organisms are paracrine signaling, endocrine signaling, autocrine signaling, and direct signaling across gap junctions. paracrine signaling takes place over short distances. endocrine signals are carried long distances through the bloodstream by hormones, and autocrine signals are received by the same cell that sent the signal or other nearby cells of the same kind. gap junctions allow small molecules, including signaling molecules, to flow between neighboring cells. internal receptors are found in the cell cytoplasm. here, they bind ligand molecules that cross the plasma membrane; these receptor-ligand complexes move to the nucleus and interact directly with cellular dna. cell-surface receptors transmit a signal from outside the cell to the cytoplasm. ion channel-linked receptors, when bound to their ligands, form a pore through the plasma membrane through which certain ions can pass. g-protein-linked receptors interact with a g-protein on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, promoting the exchange of bound gdp for gtp and interacting with other enzymes or ion channels to transmit a signal. enzyme-linked receptors transmit a signal from outside the cell to an intracellular domain of a membrane-bound enzyme. ligand binding causes activation of the enzyme. small hydrophobic ligands (like steroids) are able to penetrate the plasma membrane and bind to internal receptors. water-soluble hydrophilic ligands are unable to pass through the membrane; instead, they bind to cell-surface receptors, which transmit the signal to the inside of the cell. a. b. sigalov, the school of nature. iv. learning from viruses, self/nonself 1, no. 4 (2010): 282-298. y. cao, x.

45,stax-bio,9,Cell Communication,2,m44452,Propagation of the Signal,"once a ligand binds to a receptor, the signal is transmitted through the membrane and into the cytoplasm. continuation of a signal in this manner is called signal transduction. signal transduction only occurs with cell-surface receptors because internal receptors are able to interact directly with dna in the nucleus to initiate protein synthesis. when a ligand binds to its receptor, conformational changes occur that affect the receptors intracellular domain. conformational changes of the extracellular domain upon ligand binding can propagate through the membrane region of the receptor and lead to activation of the intracellular domain or its associated proteins. in some cases, binding of the ligand causes dimerization of the receptor, which means that two receptors bind to each other to form a stable complex called a dimer. a dimer is a chemical compound formed when two molecules (often identical) join together. the binding of the receptors in this manner enables their intracellular domains to come into close contact and activate each other. after the ligand binds to the cell-surface receptor, the activation of the receptors intracellular components sets off a chain of events that is called a signaling pathway or a signaling cascade. in a signaling pathway, second messengers, enzymes, and activated proteins interact with specific proteins, which are in turn activated in a chain reaction that eventually leads to a change in the cells environment ([link]). the events in the cascade occur in a series, much like a current flows in a river. interactions that occur before a certain point are defined as upstream events, and events after that point are called downstream events. signaling pathways can get very complicated very quickly because most cellular proteins can affect different downstream events, depending on the conditions within the cell. a single pathway can branch off toward different endpoints based on the interplay between two or more signaling pathways, and the same ligands are often used to initiate different signals in different cell types. this variation in response is due to differences in protein expression in different cell types. another complicating element is signal integration of the pathways, in which signals from two or more different cell-surface receptors merge to activate the same response in the cell. this process can ensure that multiple external requirements are met before a cell commits to a specific response. the effects of extracellular signals can also be amplified by enzymatic cascades. at the initiation of the signal, a single ligand binds to a single receptor. however, activation of a receptor-linked enzyme can activate many copies of a component of the signaling cascade, which amplifies the signal. the induction of a signaling pathway depends on the modification of a cellular component by an enzyme. there are numerous enzymatic modifications that can occur, and they are recognized in turn by the next component downstream. the following are some of the more common events in intracellular signaling. one of the most common chemical modifications that occurs in signaling pathways is the addition of a phosphate group (po43) to a molecule such as a protein in a process called phosphorylation. the phosphate can be added to a nucleotide such as gmp to form gdp or gtp. phosphates are also often added to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of proteins, where they replace the hydroxyl group of the amino acid ([link]). the transfer of the phosphate is catalyzed by an enzyme called a kinase. various kinases are named for the substrate they phosphorylate. phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues often activates enzymes. phosphorylation of tyrosine residues can either affect the activity of an enzyme or create a binding site that interacts with downstream components in the signaling cascade. phosphorylation may activate or inactivate enzymes, and the reversal of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation by a phosphatase, will reverse the effect. second messengers are small molecules that propagate a signal after it has been initiated by the binding of the signaling molecule to the receptor. these molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins. calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. the free concentration of calcium ions (ca2+) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (atp) to remove it. for signaling purposes, ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. when signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic ca2+. the response to the increase in ca2+ varies, depending on the cell type involved. for example, in the -cells of the pancreas, ca2+ signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in ca2+ leads to muscle contractions. another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic amp (camp). cyclic amp is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from atp ([link]). the main role of camp in cells is to bind to and activate an enzyme called camp-dependent kinase (a-kinase). a-kinase regulates many vital metabolic pathways: it phosphorylates serine and threonine residues of its target proteins, activating them in the process. a-kinase is found in many different types of cells, and the target proteins in each kind of cell are different. differences give rise to the variation of the responses to camp in different cells. present in small concentrations in the plasma membrane, inositol phospholipids are lipids that can also be converted into second messengers. because these molecules are membrane components, they are located near membrane-bound receptors and can easily interact with them. phosphatidylinositol (pi) is the main phospholipid that plays a role in cellular signaling. enzymes known as kinases phosphorylate pi to form pi-phosphate (pip) and pi-bisphosphate (pip2). the enzyme phospholipase c cleaves pip2 to form diacylglycerol (dag) and inositol triphosphate (ip3) ([link]).  these products of the cleavage of pip2 serve as second messengers. diacylglycerol (dag) remains in the plasma membrane and activates protein kinase c (pkc), which then phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in its target proteins. ip3 diffuses into the cytoplasm and binds to ligand-gated calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum to release ca2+ that continues the signal cascade. ligand binding to the receptor allows for signal transduction through the cell. the chain of events that conveys the signal through the cell is called a signaling pathway or cascade. signaling pathways are often very complex because of the interplay between different proteins. a major component of cell signaling cascades is the phosphorylation of molecules by enzymes known as kinases. phosphorylation adds a phosphate group to serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues in a protein, changing their shapes, and activating or inactivating the protein. small molecules like nucleotides can also be phosphorylated. second messengers are small, non-protein molecules that are used to transmit a signal within a cell. some examples of second messengers are calcium ions (ca2+), cyclic amp (camp), diacylglycerol (dag), and inositol triphosphate (ip3).","[('cell communication', 'cell communications'),

46,stax-bio,9,Cell Communication,3,m44453,Response to the Signal,"inside the cell, ligands bind to their internal receptors, allowing them to directly affect the cells dna and protein-producing machinery. using signal transduction pathways, receptors in the plasma membrane produce a variety of effects on the cell. the results of signaling pathways are extremely varied and depend on the type of cell involved as well as the external and internal conditions. a small sampling of responses is described below. some signal transduction pathways regulate the transcription of rna. others regulate the translation of proteins from mrna. an example of a protein that regulates translation in the nucleus is the map kinase erk. erk is activated in a phosphorylation cascade when epidermal growth factor (egf) binds the egf receptor (see [link]). upon phosphorylation, erk enters the nucleus and activates a protein kinase that, in turn, regulates protein translation ([link]). the second kind of protein with which pkc can interact is a protein that acts as an inhibitor. an inhibitor is a molecule that binds to a protein and prevents it from functioning or reduces its function. in this case, the inhibitor is a protein called i-b, which binds to the regulatory protein nf-b. (the symbol  represents the greek letter kappa.) when i-b is bound to nf-b, the complex cannot enter the nucleus of the cell, but when i-b is phosphorylated by pkc, it can no longer bind nf-b, and nf-b (a transcription factor) can enter the nucleus and initiate rna transcription. in this case, the effect of phosphorylation is to inactivate an inhibitor and thereby activate the process of transcription. the result of another signaling pathway affects muscle cells. the activation of -adrenergic receptors in muscle cells by adrenaline leads to an increase in cyclic amp (camp) inside the cell. also known as epinephrine, adrenaline is a hormone (produced by the adrenal gland attached to the kidney) that readies the body for short-term emergencies. cyclic amp activates pka (protein kinase a), which in turn phosphorylates two enzymes. the first enzyme promotes the degradation of glycogen by activating intermediate glycogen phosphorylase kinase (gpk) that in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase (gp) that catabolizes glycogen into glucose. (recall that your body converts excess glucose to glycogen for short-term storage. when energy is needed, glycogen is quickly reconverted to glucose.) phosphorylation of the second enzyme, glycogen synthase (gs), inhibits its ability to form glycogen from glucose. in this manner, a muscle cell obtains a ready pool of glucose by activating its formation via glycogen degradation and by inhibiting the use of glucose to form glycogen, thus preventing a futile cycle of glycogen degradation and synthesis. the glucose is then available for use by the muscle cell in response to a sudden surge of adrenalinethe fight or flight reflex. cell signaling pathways also play a major role in cell division. cells do not normally divide unless they are stimulated by signals from other cells. the ligands that promote cell growth are called growth factors. most growth factors bind to cell-surface receptors that are linked to tyrosine kinases. these cell-surface receptors are called receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks). activation of rtks initiates a signaling pathway that includes a g-protein called ras, which activates the map kinase pathway described earlier. the enzyme map kinase then stimulates the expression of proteins that interact with other cellular components to initiate cell division. cancer biologistcancer biologists study the molecular origins of cancer with the goal of developing new prevention methods and treatment strategies that will inhibit the growth of tumors without harming the normal cells of the body. as mentioned earlier, signaling pathways control cell growth. these signaling pathways are controlled by signaling proteins, which are, in turn, expressed by genes. mutations in these genes can result in malfunctioning signaling proteins. this prevents the cell from regulating its cell cycle, triggering unrestricted cell division and cancer. the genes that regulate the signaling proteins are one type of oncogene which is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. the gene encoding ras is an oncogene that was originally discovered when mutations in the ras protein were linked to cancer. further studies have indicated that 30 percent of cancer cells have a mutation in the ras gene that leads to uncontrolled growth. if left unchecked, uncontrolled cell division can lead tumor formation and metastasis, the growth of cancer cells in new locations in the body. cancer biologists have been able to identify many other oncogenes that contribute to the development of cancer. for example, her2 is a cell-surface receptor that is present in excessive amounts in 20 percent of human breast cancers. cancer biologists realized that gene duplication led to her2 overexpression in 25 percent of breast cancer patients and developed a drug called herceptin (trastuzumab). herceptin is a monoclonal antibody that targets her2 for removal by the immune system. herceptin therapy helps to control signaling through her2. the use of herceptin in combination with chemotherapy has helped to increase the overall survival rate of patients with metastatic breast cancer. more information on cancer biology research can be found at the national cancer institute website (http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer/targetedtherapies). when a cell is damaged, superfluous, or potentially dangerous to an organism, a cell can initiate a mechanism to trigger programmed cell death, or apoptosis. apoptosis allows a cell to die in a controlled manner that prevents the release of potentially damaging molecules from inside the cell. there are many internal checkpoints that monitor a cells health; if abnormalities are observed, a cell can spontaneously initiate the process of apoptosis. however, in some cases, such as a viral infection or uncontrolled cell division due to cancer, the cells normal checks and balances fail. external signaling can also initiate apoptosis. for example, most normal animal cells have receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix, a network of glycoproteins that provides structural support for cells in an organism. the binding of cellular receptors to the extracellular matrix initiates a signaling cascade within the cell. however, if the cell moves away from the extracellular matrix, the signaling ceases, and the cell undergoes apoptosis. this system keeps cells from traveling through the body and proliferating out of control, as happens with tumor cells that metastasize. another example of external signaling that leads to apoptosis occurs in t-cell development. t-cells are immune cells that bind to foreign macromolecules and particles, and target them for destruction by the immune system. normally, t-cells do not target self proteins (those of their own organism), a process that can lead to autoimmune diseases. in order to develop the ability to discriminate between self and non-self, immature t-cells undergo screening to determine whether they bind to so-called self proteins. if the t-cell receptor binds to self proteins, the cell initiates apoptosis to remove the potentially dangerous cell. apoptosis is also essential for normal embryological development. in vertebrates, for example, early stages of development include the formation of web-like tissue between individual fingers and toes ([link]). during the course of normal development, these unneeded cells must be eliminated, enabling fully separated fingers and toes to form. a cell signaling mechanism triggers apoptosis, which destroys the cells between the developing digits. the aberrant signaling often seen in tumor cells is proof that the termination of a signal at the appropriate time can be just as important as the initiation of a signal. one method of stopping a specific signal is to degrade the ligand or remove it so that it can no longer access its receptor. one reason that hydrophobic hormones like estrogen and testosterone trigger long-lasting events is because they bind carrier proteins. these proteins allow the insoluble molecules to be soluble in blood, but they also protect the hormones from degradation by circulating enzymes. inside the cell, many different enzymes reverse the cellular modifications that result from signaling cascades. for example, phosphatases are enzymes that remove the phosphate group attached to proteins by kinases in a process called dephosphorylation. cyclic amp (camp) is degraded into amp by phosphodiesterase, and the release of calcium stores is reversed by the ca2+ pumps that are located in the external and internal membranes of the cell. the initiation of a signaling pathway is a response to external stimuli. this response can take many different forms, including protein synthesis, a change in the cells metabolism, cell growth, or even cell death. many pathways influence the cell by initiating gene expression, and the methods utilized are quite numerous. some pathways activate enzymes that interact with dna transcription factors. others modify proteins and induce them to change their location in the cell. depending on the status of the organism, cells can respond by storing energy as glycogen or fat, or making it available in the form of glucose. a signal transduction pathway allows muscle cells to respond to immediate requirements for energy in the form of glucose. cell growth is almost always stimulated by external signals called growth factors. uncontrolled cell growth leads to cancer, and mutations in the genes encoding protein components of signaling pathways are often found in tumor cells. programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is important for removing damaged or unnecessary cells. the use of cellular signaling to organize the dismantling of a cell ensures that harmful molecules from the cytoplasm are not released into the spaces between cells, as they are in uncontrolled death, necrosis. apoptosis also ensures the efficient recycling of the components of the dead cell. termination of the cellular signaling cascade is very important so that the response to a signal is appropriate in both timing and intensity. degradation of signaling molecules and dephosphorylation of phosphorylated intermediates of the pathway by phosphatases are two ways to terminate signals within the cell.","[('t-cell', 't-cells'), ('cell communication', 'cell communications'), ('phosphatase',

47,stax-bio,9,Cell Communication,4,m44454,Signaling in Single-Celled Organisms,"within-cell signaling allows bacteria to respond to environmental cues, such as nutrient levels, some single-celled organisms also release molecules to signal to each other. yeasts are eukaryotes (fungi), and the components and processes found in yeast signals are similar to those of cell-surface receptor signals in multicellular organisms. budding yeasts ([link]) are able to participate in a process that is similar to sexual reproduction that entails two haploid cells (cells with one-half the normal number of chromosomes) combining to form a diploid cell (a cell with two sets of each chromosome, which is what normal body cells contain). in order to find another haploid yeast cell that is prepared to mate, budding yeasts secrete a signaling molecule called mating factor. when mating factor binds to cell-surface receptors in other yeast cells that are nearby, they stop their normal growth cycles and initiate a cell signaling cascade that includes protein kinases and gtp-binding proteins that are similar to g-proteins. signaling in bacteria enables bacteria to monitor extracellular conditions, ensure that there are sufficient amounts of nutrients, and ensure that hazardous situations are avoided. there are circumstances, however, when bacteria communicate with each other. the first evidence of bacterial communication was observed in a bacterium that has a symbiotic relationship with hawaiian bobtail squid. when the population density of the bacteria reaches a certain level, specific gene expression is initiated, and the bacteria produce bioluminescent proteins that emit light. because the number of cells present in the environment (cell density) is the determining factor for signaling, bacterial signaling was named quorum sensing. in politics and business, a quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present to vote on an issue. quorum sensing uses autoinducers as signaling molecules. autoinducers are signaling molecules secreted by bacteria to communicate with other bacteria of the same kind. the secreted autoinducers can be small, hydrophobic molecules such as acyl-homoserine lactone, (ahl) or larger peptide-based molecules; each type of molecule has a different mode of action. when ahl enters target bacteria, it binds to transcription factors, which then switch gene expression on or off ([link]). the peptide autoinducers stimulate more complicated signaling pathways that include bacterial kinases. the changes in bacteria following exposure to autoinducers can be quite extensive. the pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa has 616 different genes that respond to autoinducers. some species of bacteria that use quorum sensing form biofilms, complex colonies of bacteria (often containing several species) that exchange chemical signals to coordinate the release of toxins that will attack the host. bacterial biofilms ([link]) can sometimes be found on medical equipment; when biofilms invade implants such as hip or knee replacements or heart pacemakers, they can cause life-threatening infections. research on the details of quorum sensing has led to advances in growing bacteria for industrial purposes. recent discoveries suggest that it may be possible to exploit bacterial signaling pathways to control bacterial growth; this process could replace or supplement antibiotics that are no longer effective in certain situations. cellular communication in yeaststhe first life on our planet consisted of single-celled prokaryotic organisms that had limited interaction with each other. while some external signaling occurs between different species of single-celled organisms, the majority of signaling within bacteria and yeasts concerns only other members of the same species. the evolution of cellular communication is an absolute necessity for the development of multicellular organisms, and this innovation is thought to have required approximately 2.5 billion years to appear in early life forms. yeasts are single-celled eukaryotes, and therefore have a nucleus and organelles characteristic of more complex life forms. comparisons of the genomes of yeasts, nematode worms, fruit flies, and humans illustrate the evolution of increasingly complex signaling systems that allow for the efficient inner workings that keep humans and other complex life forms functioning correctly. kinases are a major component of cellular communication, and studies of these enzymes illustrate the evolutionary connectivity of different species. yeasts have 130 types of kinases. more complex organisms such as nematode worms and fruit flies have 454 and 239 kinases, respectively. of the 130 kinase types in yeast, 97 belong to the 55 subfamilies of kinases that are found in other eukaryotic organisms. the only obvious deficiency seen in yeasts is the complete absence of tyrosine kinases. it is hypothesized that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is needed to control the more sophisticated functions of development, differentiation, and cellular communication used in multicellular organisms. because yeasts contain many of the same classes of signaling proteins as humans, these organisms are ideal for studying signaling cascades. yeasts multiply quickly and are much simpler organisms than humans or other multicellular animals. therefore, the signaling cascades are also simpler and easier to study, although they contain similar counterparts to human signaling.1 watch this collection of interview clips with biofilm researchers in what are bacterial biofilms?

 yeasts and multicellular organisms have similar signaling mechanisms. yeasts use cell-surface receptors and signaling cascades to communicate information on mating with other yeast cells. the signaling molecule secreted by yeasts is called mating factor. bacterial signaling is called quorum sensing. bacteria secrete signaling molecules called autoinducers that are either small, hydrophobic molecules or peptide-based signals. the hydrophobic autoinducers, such as ahl, bind transcription factors and directly affect gene expression. the peptide-based molecules bind kinases and initiate signaling cascades in the cells. g. manning, g.d. plowman, t. hunter, s. sudarsanam, evolution of protein kinase signaling from yeast to man, trends in biochemical sciences 27, no. 10 (2002): 514520.","[('cell communication', 'cell communications'), ('quorum sensing', 'quorum sensings'), ('single-celled yeast', 'single-celled yeasts'), ('autoinducer', 'autoinducers'), ('mating factor', 'mating factors')]"
48,stax-bio,10,Cell Reproduction,0,m44457,Introduction,"a human, as well as every sexually reproducing organism, begins life as a fertilized egg (embryo) or zygote. trillions of cell divisions subsequently occur in a controlled manner to produce a complex, multicellular human. in other words, that original single cell is the ancestor of every other cell in the body. once a being is fully grown, cell reproduction is still necessary to repair or regenerate tissues. for example, new blood and skin cells are constantly being produced. all multicellular organisms use cell division for growth and the maintenance and repair of cells and tissues. cell division is tightly regulated, and the occasional failure of regulation can have life-threatening consequences. single-celled organisms use cell division as their method of reproduction.","[('inhibition of cell division', 'inhibition of cell division', 'inhibition of cells division', 'inhibition of cells division', 'inhibitions of cell division', 'inhibitions of cell division', 'inhibitions of cells division', 'inhibitions of cells division'), ('ftsz', 'ftszs'), ('genomic dna', 'genomic dnas'), ('chromosome compaction', 'chromosome compactions'), ('retinoblastoma protein', 'retinoblastoma proteins'), ('telophase', 'telophases'), ('mitotic spindle', 'mitotic spindles'), ('prophase', 'prophases'), ('tumor suppressor', 'tumor suppressors'), ('checkpoint', 'checkpoints'), ('origin', 'origins'), ('sister chromatid', 'sister chromatids'), ('g2', 'g2s'), ('prokaryotic genome', 'prokaryotic genomes'), ('cell cycle regulation', 'cell cycle regulations', 'cell cycles regulation', 'cell cycles regulations', 'cells cycle regulation', 'cells cycle regulations', 'cells cycles regulation', 'cells cycles regulations'), ('histone', 'histones'), ('cell cycle checkpoint', 'cell cycle checkpoints', 'cell cycles checkpoint', 'cell cycles checkpoints', 'cells cycle checkpoint', 'cells cycle checkpoints', 'cells cycles checkpoint', 'cells cycles checkpoints'), ('g1 phase', 'g1 phases'), ('gamete', 'gametes'), ('double helix', 'double helixes'), ('eukaryotic genome', 'eukaryotic genomes'), ('interphase', 'interphases'), ('oncogene', 'oncogenes'), ('locu', 'locuss', 'locus'), ('cyclin', 'cyclins'), ('metaphase plate', 'metaphase plates'), ('nucleosome', 'nucleosomes'), ('cell motion', 'cell motions'), ('cell plate', 'cell plates'), ('rb', 'rbs'), ('tumor suppressor gene', 'tumor suppressor genes', 'tumor suppressors gene', 'tumor suppressors genes', 'tumors suppressor gene', 'tumors suppressor genes', 'tumors suppressors gene', 'tumors suppressors genes'), ('p21', 'p21s'), ('cyclin-dependent kinase', 'cyclin-dependent kinases'), ('second gap', 'second gaps'), ('cell cycle', 'cell cycles'), ('dna', 'dnas'), ('haploid', 'haploids'), ('genome', 'genomes'), ('condensin', 'condensins'), ('gene', 'genes'), ('g2 checkpoint', 'g2 checkpoints'), ('initiation of cell division', 'initiation of cell division', 'initiation of cells division', 'initiation of cells division', 'initiations of cell division', 'initiations of cell division', 'initiations of cells division', 'initiations of cells division'), ('cell cycle control', 'cell cycle controls', 'cell cycles control', 'cell cycles controls', 'cells cycle control', 'cells cycle controls', 'cells cycles control', 'cells cycles controls'), ('golgi apparatu', 'golgi ', 'golgi apparatus'), ('cell reproduction', 'cell reproductions'), ('first gap', 'first gaps'), ('p53', 'p53s'), ('prometaphase', 'prometaphases'), ('proto-oncogene', 'proto-oncogenes'), ('g0 phase', 'g0 phases'), ('quiescent', 'quiescents'), ('g2 phase', 'g2 phases'), ('negative regulation', 'negative regulations'), ('cell division', 'cell divisions'), ('metaphase', 'metaphases'), ('g1 checkpoint', 'g1 checkpoints'), ('chromosome', 'chromosomes'), ('spindle checkpoint', 'spindle checkpoints'), ('trait', 'traits'), ('homologous chromosome', 'homologous chromosomes'), ('centriole', 'centrioles'), ('cytoplasm', 'cytoplasms'), ('prokaryotic cell division', 'prokaryotic cell divisions', 'prokaryotic cells division', 'prokaryotic cells divisions'), ('binary fission', 'binary fissions'), ('kinetochore', 'kinetochores'), ('mutation', 'mutations'), ('cancer', 'cancers'), ('diploid', 'diploids'), ('cytokinesi', 'cytokineses', 'cytokinesis'), ('histone protein', 'histone proteins'), ('anaphase', 'anaphases'), ('s phase', 's phases'), ('somatic cell', 'somatic cells'), ('mitosi', 'mitoses', 'mitosis'), ('cleavage furrow', 'cleavage furrows'), ('mitotic phase', 'mitotic phases'), ('g1', 'g1s'), ('centromere', 'centromeres'), ('septum', 'septums'), ('karyokinesi', 'karyokineses', 'karyokinesis'), ('chromatid', 'chromatids'), ('cdk', 'cdks'), ('m checkpoint', 'm checkpoints')]"
49,stax-bio,10,Cell Reproduction,1,m44459,Cell Division,"the continuity of life from one cell to another has its foundation in the reproduction of cells by way of the cell cycle. the cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events that describes the stages of a cells life from the division of a single parent cell to the production of two new daughter cells. the mechanisms involved in the cell cycle are highly regulated. before discussing the steps a cell must undertake to replicate, a deeper understanding of the structure and function of a cells genetic information is necessary. a cells dna, packaged as a double-stranded dna molecule, is called its genome. in prokaryotes, the genome is composed of a single, double-stranded dna molecule in the form of a loop or circle ([link]). the region in the cell containing this genetic material is called a nucleoid. some prokaryotes also have smaller loops of dna called plasmids that are not essential for normal growth.  bacteria can exchange these plasmids with other bacteria, sometimes receiving beneficial new genes that the recipient can add to their chromosomal dna. antibiotic resistance is one trait that often spreads through a bacterial colony through plasmid exchange. in eukaryotes, the genome consists of several double-stranded linear dna molecules ([link]). each species of eukaryotes has a characteristic number of chromosomes in the nuclei of its cells. human body cells have 46 chromosomes, while human gametes (sperm or eggs) have 23 chromosomes each. a typical body cell, or somatic cell, contains two matched sets of chromosomes, a configuration known as diploid. the letter n is used to represent a single set of chromosomes; therefore, a diploid organism is designated 2n. human cells that contain one set of chromosomes are called gametes, or sex cells; these are eggs and sperm, and are designated 1n, or haploid. matched pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism are called homologous (same knowledge) chromosomes. homologous chromosomes are the same length and have specific nucleotide segments called genes in exactly the same location, or locus. genes, the functional units of chromosomes, determine specific characteristics by coding for specific proteins. traits are the variations of those characteristics. for example, hair color is a characteristic with traits that are blonde, brown, or black. each copy of a homologous pair of chromosomes originates from a different parent; therefore, the genes themselves are not identical. the variation of individuals within a species is due to the specific combination of the genes inherited from both parents. even a slightly altered sequence of nucleotides within a gene can result in an alternative trait. for example, there are three possible gene sequences on the human chromosome that code for blood type: sequence a, sequence b, and sequence o. because all diploid human cells have two copies of the chromosome that determines blood type, the blood type (the trait) is determined by which two versions of the marker gene are inherited. it is possible to have two copies of the same gene sequence on both homologous chromosomes, with one on each (for example, aa, bb, or oo), or two different sequences, such as ab. minor variations of traits, such as blood type, eye color, and handedness, contribute to the natural variation found within a species. however, if the entire dna sequence from any pair of human homologous chromosomes is compared, the difference is less than one percent. the sex chromosomes, x and y, are the single exception to the rule of homologous chromosome uniformity: other than a small amount of homology that is necessary to accurately produce gametes, the genes found on the x and y chromosomes are different. if the dna from all 46 chromosomes in a human cell nucleus was laid out end to end, it would measure approximately two meters; however, its diameter would be only 2 nm. considering that the size of a typical human cell is about 10 m (100,000 cells lined up to equal one meter), dna must be tightly packaged to fit in the cells nucleus. at the same time, it must also be readily accessible for the genes to be expressed. during some stages of the cell cycle, the long strands of dna are condensed into compact chromosomes. there are a number of ways that chromosomes are compacted. in the first level of compaction, short stretches of the dna double helix wrap around a core of eight histone proteins at regular intervals along the entire length of the chromosome ([link]). the dna-histone complex is called chromatin. the beadlike, histone dna complex is called a nucleosome, and dna connecting the nucleosomes is called linker dna. a dna molecule in this form is about seven times shorter than the double helix without the histones, and the beads are about 10 nm in diameter, in contrast with the 2-nm diameter of a dna double helix. the next level of compaction occurs as the nucleosomes and the linker dna between them are coiled into a 30-nm chromatin fiber. this coiling further shortens the chromosome so that it is now about 50 times shorter than the extended form. in the third level of packing, a variety of fibrous proteins is used to pack the chromatin. these fibrous proteins also ensure that each chromosome in a non-dividing cell occupies a particular area of the nucleus that does not overlap with that of any other chromosome (see the top image in [link]). dna replicates in the s phase of interphase. after replication, the chromosomes are composed of two linked sister chromatids. when fully compact, the pairs of identically packed chromosomes are bound to each other by cohesin proteins. the connection between the sister chromatids is closest in a region called the centromere. the conjoined sister chromatids, with a diameter of about 1 m, are visible under a light microscope. the centromeric region is highly condensed and thus will appear as a constricted area. this animation illustrates the different levels of chromosome packing.

 prokaryotes have a single circular chromosome composed of double-stranded dna, whereas eukaryotes have multiple, linear chromosomes composed of chromatin surrounded by a nuclear membrane. the 46 chromosomes of human somatic cells are composed of 22 pairs of autosomes (matched pairs) and a pair of sex chromosomes, which may or may not be matched. this is the 2n or diploid state. human gametes have 23 chromosomes or one complete set of chromosomes; a set of chromosomes is complete with either one of the sex chromosomes. this is the n or haploid state.  genes are segments of dna
that code for a specific protein. an organisms traits are determined by the genes inherited from each parent. duplicated chromosomes are composed of two sister chromatids. chromosomes are compacted using a variety of mechanisms during certain stages of the cell cycle. several classes of protein are involved in the organization and packing of the chromosomal dna into a highly condensed structure. the condensing complex compacts chromosomes, and the resulting condensed structure is necessary for chromosomal segregation during mitosis.","[('eukaryotic genome', 'eukaryotic genomes'), ('nucleosome', 'nucleosomes'), ('sister chromatid', 'sister chromatids'), ('gamete', 'gametes'), ('double helix', 'double helixes'), ('centromere', 'centromeres'), ('locu', 'locuss', 'locus'), ('genome', 'genomes'), ('gene', 'genes'), ('cell cycle', 'cell cycles'), ('prokaryotic genome', 'prokaryotic genomes'), ('haploid', 'haploids'), ('cell division', 'cell divisions'), ('dna', 'dnas'), ('chromosome', 'chromosomes'), ('histone protein', 'histone proteins'), ('cell reproduction', 'cell reproductions'), ('somatic cell', 'somatic cells'), ('diploid', 'diploids'), ('genomic dna', 'genomic dnas'), ('chromosome compaction', 'chromosome compactions'), ('trait', 'traits'), ('histone', 'histones'), ('homologous chromosome', 'homologous chromosomes'), ('chromatid', 'chromatids')]"
50,stax-bio,10,Cell Reproduction,2,m44460,The Cell Cycle,"the cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells. cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, dna replication, and division that produces two identical (clone) cells. the cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase ([link]). during interphase, the cell grows and dna is replicated. during the mitotic phase, the replicated dna and cytoplasmic contents are separated, and the cell divides. during interphase, the cell undergoes normal growth processes while also preparing for cell division. in order for a cell to move from interphase into the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. the three stages of interphase are called g1, s, and g2. the first stage of interphase is called the g1 phase (first gap) because, from a microscopic aspect, little change is visible. however, during the g1 stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. the cell is accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal dna and the associated proteins as well as accumulating sufficient energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus. throughout interphase, nuclear dna remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. in the s phase, dna replication can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of dna moleculessister chromatidsthat are firmly attached to the centromeric region. the centrosome is duplicated during the s phase. the two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. at the center of each animal cell, the centrosomes of animal cells are associated with a pair of rod-like objects, the centrioles, which are at right angles to each other. centrioles help organize cell division. centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of other eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi. in the g2 phase, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation. some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic phase. there may be additional cell growth during g2. the final preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able to enter the first stage of mitosis. the mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and move into two new, identical daughter cells. the first portion of the mitotic phase is called karyokinesis, or nuclear division. the second portion of the mitotic phase, called cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into the two daughter cells. karyokinesis, also known as mitosis, is divided into a series of phasesprophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophasethat result in the division of the cell nucleus ([link]). karyokinesis is also called mitosis. during prophase, the first phase, the nuclear envelope starts to dissociate into small vesicles, and the membranous organelles (such as the golgi complex or golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum), fragment and disperse toward the periphery of the cell. the nucleolus disappears (disperses). the centrosomes begin to move to opposite poles of the cell. microtubules that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen. the sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly with the aid of condensin proteins and become visible under a light microscope. during prometaphase, the first change phase, many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance. the remnants of the nuclear envelope fragment. the mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and stretch across the length of the former nuclear area. chromosomes become more condensed and discrete. each sister chromatid develops a protein structure called a kinetochore in the centromeric region ([link]). the proteins of the kinetochore attract and bind mitotic spindle microtubules. as the spindle microtubules extend from the centrosomes, some of these microtubules come into contact with and firmly bind to the kinetochores. once a mitotic fiber attaches to a chromosome, the chromosome will be oriented until the kinetochores of sister chromatids face the opposite poles. eventually, all the sister chromatids will be attached via their kinetochores to microtubules from opposing poles. spindle microtubules that do not engage the chromosomes are called polar microtubules. these microtubules overlap each other midway between the two poles and contribute to cell elongation. astral microtubules are located near the poles, aid in spindle orientation, and are required for the regulation of mitosis. during metaphase, the change phase, all the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate, or the equatorial plane, midway between the two poles of the cell. the sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other by cohesin proteins. at this time, the chromosomes are maximally condensed. during anaphase, the upward phase, the cohesin proteins degrade, and the sister chromatids separate at the centromere. each chromatid, now called a chromosome, is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule is attached. the cell becomes visibly elongated (oval shaped) as the polar microtubules slide against each other at the metaphase plate where they overlap. during telophase, the distance phase, the chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense (unravel), relaxing into a chromatin configuration. the mitotic spindles are depolymerized into tubulin monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeletal components for each daughter cell. nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes, and nucleosomes appear within the nuclear area. cytokinesis, or cell motion, is the second main stage of the mitotic phase during which cell division is completed via the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells. division is not complete until the cell components have been apportioned and completely separated into the two daughter cells. although the stages of mitosis are similar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant cells. in cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis follows the onset of anaphase. a contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. the actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure. this fissure, or crack, is called the cleavage furrow. the furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane is cleaved in two ([link]). in plant cells, a new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. during interphase, the golgi apparatus accumulates enzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell. during telophase, these golgi vesicles are transported on microtubules to form a phragmoplast (a vesicular structure) at the metaphase plate. there, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a cell plate. as more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell walls at the periphery of the cell. enzymes use the glucose that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall. the golgi membranes become parts of the plasma membrane on either side of the new cell wall ([link]). not all cells adhere to the classic cell cycle pattern in which a newly formed daughter cell immediately enters the preparatory phases of interphase, closely followed by the mitotic phase. cells in g0 phase are not actively preparing to divide. the cell is in a quiescent (inactive) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle. some cells enter g0 temporarily until an external signal triggers the onset of g1. other cells that never or rarely divide, such as mature cardiac muscle and nerve cells, remain in g0 permanently. determine the time spent in cell cycle stages problem: how long does a cell spend in interphase compared to each stage of mitosis? background: a prepared microscope slide of blastula cross-sections will show cells arrested in various stages of the cell cycle. it is not visually possible to separate the stages of interphase from each other, but the mitotic stages are readily identifiable. if 100 cells are examined, the number of cells in each identifiable cell cycle stage will give an estimate of the time it takes for the cell to complete that stage. problem statement: given the events included in all of interphase and those that take place in each stage of mitosis, estimate the length of each stage based on a 24-hour cell cycle. before proceeding, state your hypothesis. test your hypothesis: test your hypothesis by doing the following:  place a fixed and stained microscope slide of whitefish blastula cross-sections under the scanning objective of a light microscope. locate and focus on one of the sections using the scanning objective of your microscope. notice that the section is a circle composed of dozens of closely packed individual cells. switch to the low-power objective and refocus. with this objective, individual cells are visible. switch to the high-power objective and slowly move the slide left to right, and up and down to view all the cells in the section ([link]). as you scan, you will notice that most of the cells are not undergoing mitosis but are in the interphase period of the cell cycle. slowly scan whitefish blastula cells with the high-power objective as illustrated in image (a) to identify their mitotic stage.

 record your observations: make a table similar to [link] in which you record your observations. analyze your data/report your results: to find the length of time whitefish blastula cells spend in each stage, multiply the percent (recorded as a decimal) by 24 hours. make a table similar to [link] to illustrate your data. draw a conclusion: did your results support your estimated times? were any of the outcomes unexpected? if so, discuss which events in that stage might contribute to the calculated time. the cell cycle is an orderly sequence of events. cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages. in eukaryotes, the cell cycle consists of a long preparatory period, called interphase. interphase is divided into g1, s, and g2 phases. the mitotic phase begins with karyokinesis (mitosis), which consists of five stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. the final stage of the mitotic phase is cytokinesis, during which the cytoplasmic components of the daughter cells are separated either by an actin ring (animal cells) or by cell plate formation (plant cells).","[('cell cycle', 'cell cycles'), ('mitotic spindle', 'mitotic spindles'), ('second gap', 'second gaps'), ('metaphase plate', 'metaphase plates'), ('kinetochore', 'kinetochores'), ('g1 phase', 'g1 phases'), ('centriole', 'centrioles'), ('interphase', 'interphases'), ('quiescent', 'quiescents'), ('metaphase', 'metaphases'), ('cell plate', 'cell plates'), ('prophase', 'prophases'), ('karyokinesi', 'karyokineses', 'karyokinesis'), ('g0 phase', 'g0 phases'), ('mitotic phase', 'mitotic phases'), ('first gap', 'first gaps'), ('golgi apparatu', 'golgi ', 'golgi apparatus'), ('prometaphase', 'prometaphases'), ('condensin', 'condensins'), ('cell motion', 'cell motions'), ('cytoplasm', 'cytoplasms'), ('cell reproduction', 'cell reproductions'), ('telophase', 'telophases'), ('cytokinesi', 'cytokineses', 'cytokinesis'), ('g2 phase', 'g2 phases'), ('s phase', 's phases'), ('mitosi', 'mitoses', 'mitosis'), ('cleavage furrow', 'cleavage furrows'), ('anaphase', 'anaphases')]"
51,stax-bio,10,Cell Reproduction,3,m44466,Control of the Cell Cycle,"the length of the cell cycle is highly variable, even within the cells of a single organism. in humans, the frequency of cell turnover ranges from a few hours in early embryonic development, to an average of two to five days for epithelial cells, and to an entire human lifetime spent in g0 by specialized cells, such as cortical neurons or cardiac muscle cells. there is also variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle. when fast-dividing mammalian cells are grown in culture (outside the body under optimal growing conditions), the length of the cycle is about 24 hours. in rapidly dividing human cells with a 24-hour cell cycle, the g1 phase lasts approximately nine hours, the s phase lasts 10 hours, the g2 phase lasts about four and one-half hours, and the m phase lasts approximately one-half hour. in early embryos of fruit flies, the cell cycle is completed in about eight minutes. the timing of events in the cell cycle is controlled by mechanisms that are both internal and external to the cell. both the initiation and inhibition of cell division are triggered by events external to the cell when it is about to begin the replication process. an event may be as simple as the death of a nearby cell or as sweeping as the release of growth-promoting hormones, such as human growth hormone (hgh). a lack of hgh can inhibit cell division, resulting in dwarfism, whereas too much hgh can result in gigantism. crowding of cells can also inhibit cell division. another factor that can initiate cell division is the size of the cell; as a cell grows, it becomes inefficient due to its decreasing surface-to-volume ratio. the solution to this problem is to divide. whatever the source of the message, the cell receives the signal, and a series of events within the cell allows it to proceed into interphase. moving forward from this initiation point, every parameter required during each cell cycle phase must be met or the cycle cannot progress. it is essential that the daughter cells produced be exact duplicates of the parent cell. mistakes in the duplication or distribution of the chromosomes lead to mutations that may be passed forward to every new cell produced from an abnormal cell. to prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide, there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell cycle checkpoints. a checkpoint is one of several points in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which the progression of a cell to the next stage in the cycle can be halted until conditions are favorable. these checkpoints occur near the end of g1, at the g2/m transition, and during metaphase ([link]). the g1 checkpoint determines whether all conditions are favorable for cell division to proceed. the g1 checkpoint, also called the restriction point (in yeast), is a point at which the cell irreversibly commits to the cell division process. external influences, such as growth factors, play a large role in carrying the cell past the g1 checkpoint. in addition to adequate reserves and cell size, there is a check for genomic dna damage at the g1 checkpoint. a cell that does not meet all the requirements will not be allowed to progress into the s phase. the cell can halt the cycle and attempt to remedy the problematic condition, or the cell can advance into g0 and await further signals when conditions improve. the g2 checkpoint bars entry into the mitotic phase if certain conditions are not met. as at the g1 checkpoint, cell size and protein reserves are assessed. however, the most important role of the g2 checkpoint is to ensure that all of the chromosomes have been replicated and that the replicated dna is not damaged. if the checkpoint mechanisms detect problems with the dna, the cell cycle is halted, and the cell attempts to either complete dna replication or repair the damaged dna. the m checkpoint occurs near the end of the metaphase stage of karyokinesis. the m checkpoint is also known as the spindle checkpoint, because it determines whether all the sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle microtubules. because the separation of the sister chromatids during anaphase is an irreversible step, the cycle will not proceed until the kinetochores of each pair of sister chromatids are firmly anchored to at least two spindle fibers arising from opposite poles of the cell. in addition to the internally controlled checkpoints, there are two groups of intracellular molecules that regulate the cell cycle. these regulatory molecules either promote progress of the cell to the next phase (positive regulation) or halt the cycle (negative regulation). regulator molecules may act individually, or they can influence the activity or production of other regulatory proteins. therefore, the failure of a single regulator may have almost no effect on the cell cycle, especially if more than one mechanism controls the same event. conversely, the effect of a deficient or non-functioning regulator can be wide-ranging and possibly fatal to the cell if multiple processes are affected. two groups of proteins, called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), are responsible for the progress of the cell through the various checkpoints. the levels of the four cyclin proteins fluctuate throughout the cell cycle in a predictable pattern ([link]). increases in the concentration of cyclin proteins are triggered by both external and internal signals. after the cell moves to the next stage of the cell cycle, the cyclins that were active in the previous stage are degraded. cyclins regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to cdks. to be fully active, the cdk/cyclin complex must also be phosphorylated in specific locations. like all kinases, cdks are enzymes (kinases) that phosphorylate other proteins. phosphorylation activates the protein by changing its shape. the proteins phosphorylated by cdks are involved in advancing the cell to the next phase. ([link]). the levels of cdk proteins are relatively stable throughout the cell cycle; however, the concentrations of cyclin fluctuate and determine when cdk/cyclin complexes form. the different cyclins and cdks bind at specific points in the cell cycle and thus regulate different checkpoints. since the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are based on the timing of the cell cycle and not on specific events, regulation of the cell cycle usually occurs by either the cdk molecules alone or the cdk/cyclin complexes. without a specific concentration of fully activated cyclin/cdk complexes, the cell cycle cannot proceed through the checkpoints. although the cyclins are the main regulatory molecules that determine the forward momentum of the cell cycle, there are several other mechanisms that fine-tune the progress of the cycle with negative, rather than positive, effects. these mechanisms essentially block the progression of the cell cycle until problematic conditions are resolved. molecules that prevent the full activation of cdks are called cdk inhibitors. many of these inhibitor molecules directly or indirectly monitor a particular cell cycle event. the block placed on cdks by inhibitor molecules will not be removed until the specific event that the inhibitor monitors is completed. the second group of cell cycle regulatory molecules are negative regulators. negative regulators halt the cell cycle. remember that in positive regulation, active molecules cause the cycle to progress. the best understood negative regulatory molecules are retinoblastoma protein (rb), p53, and p21. retinoblastoma proteins are a  group of tumor-suppressor proteins common in many cells. the 53 and 21 designations refer to the functional molecular masses of the proteins (p) in kilodaltons. much of what is known about cell cycle regulation comes from research conducted with cells that have lost regulatory control. all three of these regulatory proteins were discovered to be damaged or non-functional in cells that had begun to replicate uncontrollably (became cancerous). in each case, the main cause of the unchecked progress through the cell cycle was a faulty copy of the regulatory protein. rb, p53, and p21 act primarily at the g1 checkpoint. p53 is a multi-functional protein that has a major impact on the commitment of a cell to division because it acts when there is damaged dna in cells that are undergoing the preparatory processes during g1. if damaged dna is detected, p53 halts the cell cycle and recruits enzymes to repair the dna. if the dna cannot be repaired, p53 can trigger apoptosis, or cell suicide, to prevent the duplication of damaged chromosomes. as p53 levels rise, the production of p21 is triggered. p21 enforces the halt in the cycle dictated by p53 by binding to and inhibiting the activity of the cdk/cyclin complexes. as a cell is exposed to more stress, higher levels of p53 and p21 accumulate, making it less likely that the cell will move into the s phase. rb exerts its regulatory influence on other positive regulator proteins. chiefly, rb monitors cell size. in the active, dephosphorylated state, rb binds to proteins called transcription factors, most commonly, e2f ([link]). transcription factors turn on specific genes, allowing the production of proteins encoded by that gene. when rb is bound to e2f, production of proteins necessary for the g1/s transition is blocked. as the cell increases in size, rb is slowly phosphorylated until it becomes inactivated. rb releases e2f, which can now turn on the gene that produces the transition protein, and this particular block is removed. for the cell to move past each of the checkpoints, all positive regulators must be turned on, and all negative regulators must be turned off. each step of the cell cycle is monitored by internal controls called checkpoints. there are three major checkpoints in the cell cycle: one near the end of g1, a second at the g2/m transition, and the third during metaphase. positive regulator molecules allow the cell cycle to advance to the next stage. negative regulator molecules monitor cellular conditions and can halt the cycle until specific requirements are met.","[('inhibition of cell division', 'inhibition of cell division', 'inhibition of cells division', 'inhibition of cells division', 'inhibitions of cell

52,stax-bio,10,Cell Reproduction,4,m44463,Cancer and the Cell Cycle,"cancer comprises many different diseases caused by a common mechanism: uncontrolled cell growth. despite the redundancy and overlapping levels of cell cycle control, errors do occur. one of the critical processes monitored by the cell cycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of dna during the s phase. even when all of the cell cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells. if changes to the dna nucleotide sequence occur within a coding portion of a gene and are not corrected, a gene mutation results. all cancers start when a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that plays a key role in cell reproduction. the change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor: perhaps a slight delay in the binding of cdk to cyclin or an rb protein that detaches from its target dna while still phosphorylated. even minor mistakes, however, may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily. over and over, small uncorrected errors are passed from the parent cell to the daughter cells and amplified as each generation produces more non-functional proteins from uncorrected dna damage. eventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases. uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor (-oma) can result. the genes that code for the positive cell cycle regulators are called proto-oncogenes. proto-oncogenes are normal genes that, when mutated in certain ways, become oncogenes, genes that cause a cell to become cancerous. consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene. in most instances, the alteration of the dna sequence will result in a less functional (or non-functional) protein. the result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing the cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward. if a cell cannot reproduce, the mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal. occasionally, however, a gene mutation causes a change that increases the activity of a positive regulator. for example, a mutation that allows cdk to be activated without being partnered with cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are met. if the resulting daughter cells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated and no harm would come to the organism. however, if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions, subsequent generations of cells will probably accumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle. the cdk gene in the above example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes. in addition to the cell cycle regulatory proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell cycle checkpoints. an oncogene is any gene that, when altered, leads to an increase in the rate of cell cycle progression. like proto-oncogenes, many of the negative cell cycle regulatory proteins were discovered in cells that had become cancerous. tumor suppressor genes are segments of dna that code for negative regulator proteins, the type of regulators that, when activated, can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division. the collective function of the best-understood tumor suppressor gene proteins, rb, p53, and p21, is to put up a roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain events are completed. a cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if there is a problem. tumor suppressors are similar to brakes in a vehicle: malfunctioning brakes can contribute to a car crash. mutated p53 genes have been identified in more than one-half of all human tumor cells. this discovery is not surprising in light of the multiple roles that the p53 protein plays at the g1 checkpoint. a cell with a faulty p53 may fail to detect errors present in the genomic dna ([link]). even if a partially functional p53 does identify the mutations, it may no longer be able to signal the necessary dna repair enzymes. either way, damaged dna will remain uncorrected. at this point, a functional p53
will deem the cell unsalvageable and trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis). the damaged version of p53 found in cancer cells, however, cannot trigger apoptosis. the loss of p53 function has other repercussions for the cell cycle. mutated p53 might lose its ability to trigger p21 production. without adequate levels of p21, there is no effective block on cdk activation. essentially, without a fully functional p53, the g1 checkpoint is severely compromised and the cell proceeds directly from g1 to s regardless of internal and external conditions. at the completion of this shortened cell cycle, two daughter cells are produced that have inherited the mutated p53 gene. given the non-optimal conditions under which the parent cell reproduced, it is likely that the daughter cells will have acquired other mutations in addition to the faulty tumor suppressor gene. cells such as these daughter cells quickly accumulate both oncogenes and non-functional tumor suppressor genes. again, the result is tumor growth. watch an animation of how cancer results from errors in the cell cycle.

 cancer is the result of unchecked cell division caused by a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle. the loss of control begins with a change in the dna sequence of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules. faulty instructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should. any disruption of the monitoring system can allow other mistakes to be passed on to the daughter cells. each successive cell division will give rise to daughter cells with even more accumulated damage. eventually, all checkpoints become nonfunctional, and rapidly reproducing cells crowd out normal cells, resulting in a tumor or leukemia (blood cancer).","[('cell reproduction', 'cell reproductions'), ('tumor suppressor', 'tumor suppressors'), ('cell cycle', 'cell cycles'), ('proto-oncogene', 'proto-oncogenes'), ('mutation', 'mutations'), ('cancer', 'cancers'), ('tumor suppressor gene', 'tumor suppressor genes', 'tumor suppressors gene', 'tumor suppressors genes', 'tumors suppressor gene', 'tumors suppressor genes', 'tumors suppressors gene', 'tumors suppressors genes'), ('cell cycle regulation', 'cell cycle regulations', 'cell cycles regulation', 'cell cycles regulations', 'cells cycle regulation', 'cells cycle regulations', 'cells cycles regulation', 'cells cycles regulations'), ('oncogene', 'oncogenes')]"
53,stax-bio,10,Cell Reproduction,5,m44467,Prokaryotic Cell Division,"prokaryotes, such as bacteria, propagate by binary fission. for unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method to produce new individuals. in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. in unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals. to achieve the outcome of cloned offspring, certain steps are essential. the genomic dna must be replicated and then allocated into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the machinery to sustain life. in bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular dna chromosome; therefore, the process of cell division is simplified. karyokinesis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus and thus no need to direct one copy of the multiple chromosomes into each daughter cell. this type of cell division is called binary (prokaryotic) fission. due to the relative simplicity of the prokaryotes, the cell division process, called binary fission, is a less complicated and much more rapid process than cell division in eukaryotes. the single, circular dna chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell ([link]). although the dna of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size, there are no histone proteins and thus no nucleosomes in prokaryotes. the packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to the cohesin and condensin proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes. the bacterial chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at about the midpoint of the cell. the starting point of replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane ([link]). replication of the dna is bidirectional, moving away from the origin on both strands of the loop simultaneously. as the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell wall attachment toward the opposite ends of the cell. as the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. after the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. the formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called ftsz directs the partition between the nucleoids. formation of the ftsz ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell wall materials to the site. a septum is formed between the nucleoids, extending gradually from the periphery toward the center of the cell. when the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate. mitotic spindle apparatusthe precise timing and formation of the mitotic spindle is critical to the success of eukaryotic cell division. prokaryotic cells, on the other hand, do not undergo karyokinesis and therefore have no need for a mitotic spindle. however, the ftsz protein that plays such a vital role in prokaryotic cytokinesis is structurally and functionally very similar to tubulin, the building block of the microtubules that make up the mitotic spindle fibers that are necessary for eukaryotes. ftsz proteins can form filaments, rings, and other three-dimensional structures that resemble the way tubulin forms microtubules, centrioles, and various cytoskeletal components. in addition, both ftsz and tubulin employ the same energy source, gtp (guanosine triphosphate), to rapidly assemble and disassemble complex structures. ftsz and tubulin are homologous structures derived from common evolutionary origins. in this example, ftsz is the ancestor protein to tubulin (a modern protein). while both proteins are found in extant organisms, tubulin function has evolved and diversified tremendously since evolving from its ftsz prokaryotic origin. a survey of mitotic assembly components found in present-day unicellular eukaryotes reveals crucial intermediary steps to the complex membrane-enclosed genomes of multicellular eukaryotes ([link]). in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division, the genomic dna is replicated and then each copy is allocated into a daughter cell. in addition, the cytoplasmic contents are divided evenly and distributed to the new cells. however, there are many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division. bacteria have a single, circular dna chromosome but no nucleus. therefore, mitosis is not necessary in bacterial cell division. bacterial cytokinesis is directed by a ring composed of a protein called ftsz. ingrowth of membrane and cell wall material from the periphery of the cells results in the formation of a septum that eventually constructs the separate cell walls of the daughter cells.","[('binary fission', 'binary fissions'), ('prokaryote cell division', 'prokaryote cell divisions', 'prokaryote cells division', 'prokaryote cells divisions', 'prokaryotes cell division', 'prokaryotes cell divisions', 'prokaryotes cells division', 'prokaryotes cells divisions'), ('ftsz', 'ftszs'), ('origin', 'origins'), ('prokaryotic cell division', 'prokaryotic cell divisions', 'prokaryotic cells division', 'prokaryotic cells divisions'), ('cell reproduction', 'cell reproductions'), ('septum', 'septums')]"
54,stax-bio,11,Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction,0,m44468,Introduction,"the ability to reproduce in kind is a basic characteristic of all living things. in kind means that the offspring of any organism closely resemble their parent or parents. hippopotamuses give birth to hippopotamus calves, joshua trees produce seeds from which joshua tree seedlings emerge, and adult flamingos lay eggs that hatch into flamingo chicks. in kind does not generally mean exactly the same. whereas many unicellular organisms and a few multicellular organisms can produce genetically identical clones of themselves through cell division, many single-celled organisms and most multicellular organisms reproduce regularly using another method. sexual reproduction is the production by parents of two haploid cells and the fusion of two haploid cells to form a single, unique diploid cell. in most plants and animals, through tens of rounds of mitotic cell division, this diploid cell will develop into an adult organism. haploid cells that are part of the sexual reproductive cycle are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis. sexual reproduction, specifically meiosis and fertilization, introduces variation into offspring that may account for the evolutionary success of sexual reproduction. the vast majority of eukaryotic organisms, both multicellular and unicellular, can or must employ some form of meiosis and fertilization to reproduce.","[('synapsi', 'synapses', 'synapsis'), ('prometaphase i', 'prometaphase is'), ('meiosi ius', 'meiosi iis', 'meiosi ii'), ('synaptonemal complex', 'synaptonemal complexes'), ('sporophyte', 'sporophytes'), ('centrosome', 'centrosomes'), ('reduction division', 'reduction divisions'), ('gametophyte', 'gametophytes'), ('metaphase ius', 'metaphase iis', 'metaphase ii'), ('second gap', 'second gaps'), ('ploidy level', 'ploidy levels'), ('interkinesi', 'interkineses', 'interkinesis'), ('kinetochore', 'kinetochores'), ('g1 phase', 'g1 phases'), ('prometaphase ius', 'prometaphase iis', 'prometaphase ii'), ('chiasmatum', 'chiasmatas', 'chiasmata'), ('meiosi', 'meioses', 'meiosis'), ('nuclear division', 'nuclear divisions'), ('sexual reproduction', 'sexual reproductions'), ('diploid dominant', 'diploid dominants'), ('gamete', 'gametes'), ('cell plate', 'cell plates'), ('wilkin and holliday', 'wilkin and hollidays', 'wilkins and holliday', 'wilkins and hollidays'), ('chromatid', 'chromatids'), ('alternation of generation', 'alternation of generations', 'alternation of generations', 'alternations of generation', 'alternations of generations', 'alternations of generations'), ('haploid', 'haploids'), ('germ cell', 'germ cells'), ('prophase i', 'prophase is'), ('red queen hypothesi', 'red queen hypotheses', 'red queen hypothesis', 'red queens hypothesi', 'red queens hypotheses', 'red queens hypothesis'), ('somatic cell', 'somatic cells'), ('telophase i', 'telophase is'), ('fertilization', 'fertilizations'), ('haploid dominant', 'haploid dominants'), ('first gap', 'first gaps'), ('anaphase ius', 'anaphase iis', 'anaphase ii'), ('sexual lifecycle', 'sexual lifecycles'), ('crossover', 'crossovers'), ('g2 phase', 'g2 phases'), ('metaphase i', 'metaphase is'), ('homologous chromosome', 'homologous chromosomes'), ('cohesin', 'cohesins'), ('chromosome', 'chromosomes'), ('s phase', 's phases'), ('non-sister chromatid', 'non-sister chromatids'), ('lifecycle', 'lifecycles'), ('meiosi i', 'meiosi is'), ('single nuclear division', 'single nuclear divisions'), ('genetic recombination', 'genetic recombinations'), ('spore', 'spores'), ('diploid', 'diploids'), ('cytokinesi', 'cytokineses', 'cytokinesis'), ('daughter nuclei', 'daughter nucleis'), ('anaphase i', 'anaphase is'), ('genetic variation', 'genetic variations'), ('marilee ramesh', 'marilee rameshes'), ('mitosi', 'mitoses', 'mitosis'), ('cleavage furrow', 'cleavage furrows'), ('chiasma', 'chiasmas'), ('centromere', 'centromeres'), ('prophase ius', 'prophase iis', 'prophase ii'), ('diploid zygote', 'diploid zygotes'), ('recombination nodule', 'recombination nodules')]"
55,stax-bio,11,Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction,1,m44469,The Process of Meiosis,"sexual reproduction requires fertilization, the union of two cells from two individual organisms. if those two cells each contain one set of chromosomes, then the resulting cell contains two sets of chromosomes. haploid cells contain one set of chromosomes. cells containing two sets of chromosomes are called diploid. the number of sets of chromosomes in a cell is called its ploidy level. if the reproductive cycle is to continue, then the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets before fertilization can occur again, or there will be a continual doubling in the number of chromosome sets in every generation. so, in addition to fertilization, sexual reproduction includes a nuclear division that reduces the number of chromosome sets. most animals and plants are diploid, containing two sets of chromosomes. in each somatic cell of the organism (all cells of a multicellular organism except the gametes or reproductive cells), the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome, called homologous chromosomes. somatic cells are sometimes referred to as body cells. homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing the same genes in identical locations along their length. diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome from each parent; all together, they are considered a full set of chromosomes. haploid cells, containing a single copy of each homologous chromosome, are found only within structures that give rise to either gametes or spores. spores are haploid cells that can produce a haploid organism or can fuse with another spore to form a diploid cell. all animals and most plants produce eggs and sperm, or gametes. some plants and all fungi produce spores. the nuclear division that forms haploid cells, which is called meiosis, is related to mitosis. as you have learned, mitosis is the part of a cell reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also genetically identical to the original parent nucleus. in mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei are at the same ploidy leveldiploid for most plants and animals. meiosis employs many of the same mechanisms as mitosis. however, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the nuclei that result at the end of a meiotic cell division are haploid. to achieve this reduction in chromosome number, meiosis consists of one round of chromosome duplication and two rounds of nuclear division. because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the same stage names are assigned. however, because there are two rounds of division, the major process and the stages are designated with a i or a ii. thus, meiosis i is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase i, prometaphase i, and so on. meiosis ii, in which the second round of meiotic division takes place, includes prophase ii, prometaphase ii, and so on. meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of the g1, s, and g2 phases, which are nearly identical to the phases preceding mitosis. the g1 phase, which is also called the first gap phase, is the first phase of the interphase and is focused on cell growth. the s phase is the second phase of interphase, during which the dna of the chromosomes is replicated. finally, the g2 phase, also called the second gap phase, is the third and final phase of interphase; in this phase, the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis. during dna duplication in the s phase, each chromosome is replicated to produce two identical copies, called sister chromatids, that are held together at the centromere by cohesin proteins. cohesin holds the chromatids together until anaphase ii. the centrosomes, which are the structures that organize the microtubules of the meiotic spindle, also replicate. this prepares the cell to enter prophase i, the first meiotic phase. early in prophase i, before the chromosomes can be seen clearly microscopically, the homologous chromosomes are attached at their tips to the nuclear envelope by proteins. as the nuclear envelope begins to break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair close to each other.  recall that, in mitosis, homologous chromosomes do not pair together. in mitosis, homologous chromosomes line up end-to-end so that when they divide, each daughter cell receives a sister chromatid from both members of the homologous pair. the synaptonemal complex, a lattice of proteins between the homologous chromosomes, first forms at specific locations and then spreads to cover the entire length of the chromosomes. the tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called synapsis. in synapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are aligned precisely with each other. the synaptonemal complex supports the exchange of chromosomal segments between non-sister homologous chromatids, a process called crossing over. crossing over can be observed visually after the exchange as chiasmata (singular = chiasma) ([link]). in species such as humans, even though the x and y sex chromosomes are not homologous (most of their genes differ), they have a small region of homology that allows the x and y chromosomes to pair up during prophase i. a partial synaptonemal complex develops only between the regions of homology. located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules. these assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossoveror genetic recombinationbetween the non-sister chromatids. near the recombination nodule on each chromatid, the double-stranded dna is cleaved, the cut ends are modified, and a new connection is made between the non-sister chromatids. as prophase i progresses, the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense. when the synaptonemal complex is gone, the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata. the chiasmata remain until anaphase i. the number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome. there must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis i, but there may be as many as 25. following crossover, the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed. at the end of prophase i, the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata ([link]) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible. the crossover events are the first source of genetic variation in the nuclei produced by meiosis. a single crossover event between homologous non-sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent dna between a maternal chromosome and a paternal chromosome. now, when that sister chromatid is moved into a gamete cell it will carry some dna from one parent of the individual and some dna from the other parent. the sister recombinant chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover. multiple crossovers in an arm of the chromosome have the same effect, exchanging segments of dna to create recombinant chromosomes. the key event in prometaphase i is the attachment of the spindle fiber microtubules to the kinetochore proteins at the centromeres. kinetochore proteins are multiprotein complexes that bind the centromeres of a chromosome to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. microtubules grow from centrosomes placed at opposite poles of the cell. the microtubules move toward the middle of the cell and attach to one of the two fused homologous chromosomes. the microtubules attach at each chromosomes' kinetochores. with each member of the homologous pair attached to opposite poles of the cell, in the next phase, the microtubules can pull the homologous pair apart. a spindle fiber that has attached to a kinetochore is called a kinetochore microtubule. at the end of prometaphase i, each tetrad is attached to microtubules from both poles, with one homologous chromosome facing each pole. the homologous chromosomes are still held together at chiasmata. in addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down entirely. during metaphase i, the homologous chromosomes are arranged in the center of the cell with the kinetochores facing opposite poles.  the homologous pairs orient themselves randomly at the equator. for example, if the two homologous members of chromosome 1 are labeled a and b, then the chromosomes could line up a-b, or b-a. this is important in determining the genes carried by a gamete, as each will only receive one of the two homologous chromosomes. recall that homologous chromosomes are not identical. they contain slight differences in their genetic information, causing each gamete to have a unique genetic makeup. this randomness is the physical basis for the creation of the second form of genetic variation in offspring. consider that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate sets, one from each parent. using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother. the father provides the other set of 23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg. every cell of the multicellular offspring has copies of the original two sets of homologous chromosomes. in prophase i of meiosis, the homologous chromosomes form the tetrads. in metaphase i, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell to form the metaphase plate. because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome, the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. any maternally inherited chromosome may face either pole. any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole. the orientation of each tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads. this eventthe random (or independent) assortment of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase plateis the second mechanism that introduces variation into the gametes or spores. in each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of the tetrads is different. the number of variations is dependent on the number of chromosomes making up a set. there are two possibilities for orientation at the metaphase plate; the possible number of alignments therefore equals 2n, where n is the number of chromosomes per set. humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million (223) possible genetically-distinct gametes. this number does not include the variability that was previously created in the sister chromatids by crossover. given these two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic composition ([link]). to summarize the genetic consequences of meiosis i, the maternal and paternal genes are recombined by crossover events that occur between each homologous pair during prophase i. in addition, the random assortment of tetrads on the metaphase plate produces a unique combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes that will make their way into the gametes. in anaphase i, the microtubules pull the linked chromosomes apart. the sister chromatids remain tightly bound together at the centromere. the chiasmata are broken in anaphase i as the microtubules attached to the fused kinetochores pull the homologous chromosomes apart ([link]). in telophase, the separated chromosomes arrive at opposite poles. the remainder of the typical telophase events may or may not occur, depending on the species. in some organisms, the chromosomes decondense and nuclear envelopes form around the chromatids in telophase i. in other organisms, cytokinesisthe physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cellsoccurs without reformation of the nuclei. in nearly all species of animals and some fungi, cytokinesis separates the cell contents via a cleavage furrow (constriction of the actin ring that leads to cytoplasmic division). in plants, a cell plate is formed during cell cytokinesis by golgi vesicles fusing at the metaphase plate. this cell plate will ultimately lead to the formation of cell walls that separate the two daughter cells. two haploid cells are the end result of the first meiotic division. the cells are haploid because at each pole, there is just one of each pair of the homologous chromosomes. therefore, only one full set of the chromosomes is present. this is why the cells are considered haploidthere is only one chromosome set, even though each homolog still consists of two sister chromatids.  recall that sister chromatids are merely duplicates of one of the two homologous chromosomes (except for changes that occurred during crossing over). in meiosis ii, these two sister chromatids will separate, creating four haploid daughter cells.  in some species, cells enter a brief interphase, or interkinesis, before entering meiosis ii. interkinesis lacks an s phase, so chromosomes are not duplicated. the two cells produced in meiosis i go through the events of meiosis ii in synchrony. during meiosis ii, the sister chromatids within the two daughter cells separate, forming four new haploid gametes. the mechanics of meiosis ii is similar to mitosis, except that each dividing cell has only one set of homologous chromosomes. therefore, each cell has half the number of sister chromatids to separate out as a diploid cell undergoing mitosis. if the chromosomes decondensed in telophase i, they condense again. if nuclear envelopes were formed, they fragment into vesicles. the centrosomes that were duplicated during interkinesis move away from each other toward opposite poles, and new spindles are formed. the nuclear envelopes are completely broken down, and the spindle is fully formed. each sister chromatid forms an individual kinetochore that attaches to microtubules from opposite poles. the sister chromatids are maximally condensed and aligned at the equator of the cell. the sister chromatids are pulled apart by the kinetochore microtubules and move toward opposite poles. non-kinetochore microtubules elongate the cell. the chromosomes arrive at opposite poles and begin to decondense. nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes. cytokinesis separates the two cells into four unique haploid cells. at this point, the newly formed nuclei are both haploid. the cells produced are genetically unique because of the random assortment of paternal and maternal homologs and because of the recombining of maternal and paternal segments of chromosomes (with their sets of genes) that occurs during crossover. the entire process of meiosis is outlined in [link]. mitosis and meiosis are both forms of division of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells. they share some similarities, but also exhibit distinct differences that lead to very different outcomes ([link]). mitosis is a single nuclear division that results in two nuclei that are usually partitioned into two new cells. the nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically identical to the original nucleus. they have the same number of sets of chromosomes, one set in the case of haploid cells and two sets in the case of diploid cells. in most plants and all animal species, it is typically diploid cells that undergo mitosis to form new diploid cells. in contrast, meiosis consists of two nuclear divisions resulting in four nuclei that are usually partitioned into four new cells. the nuclei resulting from meiosis are not genetically identical and they contain one chromosome set only. this is half the number of chromosome sets in the original cell, which is diploid. the main differences between mitosis and meiosis occur in meiosis i, which is a very different nuclear division than mitosis. in meiosis i, the homologous chromosome pairs become associated with each other, are bound together with the synaptonemal complex, develop chiasmata and undergo crossover between sister chromatids, and line up along the metaphase plate in tetrads with kinetochore fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog in a tetrad. all of these events occur only in meiosis i. when the chiasmata resolve and the tetrad is broken up with the homologs moving to one pole or another, the ploidy levelthe number of sets of chromosomes in each future nucleushas been reduced from two to one. for this reason, meiosis i is referred to as a reduction division. there is no such reduction in ploidy level during mitosis. meiosis ii is much more analogous to a mitotic division. in this case, the duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line up on the metaphase plate with divided kinetochores attached to kinetochore fibers from opposite poles. during anaphase ii, as in mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatidnow referred to as a chromosomeis pulled to one pole while the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. if it were not for the fact that there had been crossover, the two products of each individual meiosis ii division would be identical (like in mitosis). instead, they are different because there has always been at least one crossover per chromosome. meiosis ii is not a reduction division because although there are fewer copies of the genome in the resulting cells, there is still one set of chromosomes, as there was at the end of meiosis i. the mystery of the evolution of meiosissome characteristics of organisms are so widespread and fundamental that it is sometimes difficult to remember that they evolved like other simpler traits. meiosis is such an extraordinarily complex series of cellular events that biologists have had trouble hypothesizing and testing how it may have evolved. although meiosis is inextricably entwined with sexual reproduction and its advantages and disadvantages, it is important to separate the questions of the evolution of meiosis and the evolution of sex, because early meiosis may have been advantageous for different reasons than it is now. thinking outside the box and imagining what the early benefits from meiosis might have been is one approach to uncovering how it may have evolved. meiosis and mitosis share obvious cellular processes and it makes sense that meiosis evolved from mitosis. the difficulty lies in the clear differences between meiosis i and mitosis. adam wilkins and robin holliday1 summarized the unique events that needed to occur for the evolution of meiosis from mitosis. these steps are homologous chromosome pairing, crossover exchanges, sister chromatids remaining attached during anaphase, and suppression of dna replication in interphase. they argue that the first step is the hardest and most important, and that understanding how it evolved would make the evolutionary process clearer. they suggest genetic experiments that might shed light on the evolution of synapsis. there are other approaches to understanding the evolution of meiosis in progress. different forms of meiosis exist in single-celled protists. some appear to be simpler or more primitive forms of meiosis. comparing the meiotic divisions of different protists may shed light on the evolution of meiosis. marilee ramesh and colleagues2 compared the genes involved in meiosis in protists to understand when and where meiosis might have evolved. although research is still ongoing, recent scholarship into meiosis in protists suggests that some aspects of meiosis may have evolved later than others. this kind of genetic comparison can tell us what aspects of meiosis are the oldest and what cellular processes they may have borrowed from in earlier cells. sexual reproduction requires that diploid organisms produce haploid cells that can fuse during fertilization to form diploid offspring. as with mitosis, dna replication occurs prior to meiosis during the s-phase of the cell cycle. meiosis is a series of events that arrange and separate chromosomes and chromatids into daughter cells. during the interphases of meiosis, each chromosome is duplicated. in meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear division resulting in four nuclei and usually four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. the first separates homologs, and the secondlike mitosisseparates chromatids into individual chromosomes. during meiosis, variation in the daughter nuclei is introduced because of crossover in prophase i and random alignment of tetrads at metaphase i. the cells that are produced by meiosis are genetically unique. meiosis and mitosis share similarities, but have distinct outcomes. mitotic divisions are single nuclear divisions that produce daughter nuclei that are genetically identical and have the same number of chromosome sets as the original cell. meiotic divisions include two nuclear divisions that produce four daughter nuclei that are genetically different and have one chromosome set instead of the two sets of chromosomes in the parent cell. the main differences between the processes occur in the first division of meiosis, in which homologous chromosomes are paired and exchange non-sister chromatid segments. the homologous chromosomes separate into different nuclei during meiosis i, causing a reduction of ploidy level in the first division. the second division of meiosis is more similar to a mitotic division, except that the daughter cells do not contain identical genomes because of crossover. adam s. wilkins and

56,stax-bio,11,Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction,2,m44470,Sexual Reproduction,"sexual reproduction was an early evolutionary innovation after the appearance of eukaryotic cells. it appears to have been very successful because most eukaryotes are able to reproduce sexually, and in many animals, it is the only mode of reproduction. and yet, scientists recognize some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction. on the surface, creating offspring that are genetic clones of the parent appears to be a better system. if the parent organism is successfully occupying a habitat, offspring with the same traits would be similarly successful. there is also the obvious benefit to an organism that can produce offspring whenever circumstances are favorable by asexual budding, fragmentation, or asexual eggs. these methods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex. indeed, some organisms that lead a solitary lifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually. in addition, in asexual populations, every individual is capable of reproduction. in sexual populations, the males are not producing the offspring themselves, so in theory an asexual population could grow twice as fast. however, multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual reproduction are exceedingly rare. why is sexuality (and meiosis) so common? this is one of the important unanswered questions in biology and has been the focus of much research beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century. there are several possible explanations, one of which is that the variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important to the survival and reproduction of the population. thus, on average, a sexually reproducing population will leave more descendants than an otherwise similar asexually reproducing population. the only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. this is the ultimate source of variation in sexual organisms, but in addition, those different mutations are continually reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes and the genes are mixed into different combinations by crossovers during prophase i and random assortment at metaphase i. the red queen hypothesisit is not in dispute that sexual reproduction provides evolutionary advantages to organisms that employ this mechanism to produce offspring. but why, even in the face of fairly stable conditions, does sexual reproduction persist when it is more difficult and costly for individual organisms? variation is the outcome of sexual reproduction, but why are ongoing variations necessary? enter the red queen hypothesis, first proposed by leigh van valen in 1973.1 the concept was named in reference to the red queen's race in lewis carroll's book, through the looking-glass. all species co-evolve with other organisms; for example predators evolve with their prey, and parasites evolve with their hosts. each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species an edge over close competitors, predators, parasites, or even prey. the only method that will allow a co-evolving species to maintain its own share of the resources is to also continually improve its fitness. as one species gains an advantage, this increases selection on the other species; they must also develop an advantage or they will be outcompeted. no single species progresses too far ahead because genetic variation among the progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a mechanism to improve rapidly. species that cannot keep up become extinct. the red queens catchphrase was, it takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place. this is an apt description of co-evolution between competing species. fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles. what happens between these two events depends on the organism. the process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half. fertilization, the joining of two haploid gametes, restores the diploid condition. there are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms: diploid-dominant, in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as with most animals including humans; haploid-dominant, in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage, such as with all fungi and some algae; and alternation of generations, in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group, as with plants and some algae. nearly all animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes. early in the development of the embryo, specialized diploid cells, called germ cells, are produced within the gonads, such as the testes and ovaries. germ cells are capable of mitosis to perpetuate the cell line and meiosis to produce gametes. once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again. there is no multicellular haploid life stage. fertilization occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals, restoring the diploid state ([link]). most fungi and algae employ a life-cycle type in which the body of the organismthe ecologically important part of the life cycleis haploid. the haploid cells that make up the tissues of the dominant multicellular stage are formed by mitosis. during sexual reproduction, specialized haploid cells from two individuals, designated the (+) and () mating types, join to form a diploid zygote. the zygote immediately undergoes meiosis to form four haploid cells called spores. although haploid like the parents, these spores contain a new genetic combination from two parents. the spores can remain dormant for various time periods. eventually, when conditions are conducive, the spores form multicellular haploid structures by many rounds of mitosis ([link]). 
fungi, such as black bread mold (rhizopus nigricans), have haploid-dominant life cycles. the haploid multicellular stage produces specialized haploid cells by mitosis that fuse to form a diploid zygote. the zygote undergoes meiosis to produce haploid spores. each spore gives rise to a multicellular haploid organism by mitosis.

 if a mutation occurs so that a fungus is no longer able to produce a minus mating type, will it still be able to reproduce? the third life-cycle type, employed by some algae and all plants, is a blend of the haploid-dominant and diploid-dominant extremes. species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle. the haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes, because they produce gametes from specialized cells. meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case, because the organism that produces the gametes is already a haploid. fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote. the zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte. specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores. the spores will subsequently develop into the gametophytes ([link]). although all plants utilize some version of the alternation of generations, the relative size of the sporophyte and the gametophyte and the relationship between them vary greatly. in plants such as moss, the gametophyte organism is the free-living plant, and the sporophyte is physically dependent on the gametophyte. in other plants, such as ferns, both the gametophyte and sporophyte plants are free-living; however, the sporophyte is much larger. in seed plants, such as magnolia trees and daisies, the gametophyte is composed of only a few cells and, in the case of the female gametophyte, is completely retained within the sporophyte. sexual reproduction takes many forms in multicellular organisms. however, at some point in each type of life cycle, meiosis produces haploid cells that will fuse with the haploid cell of another organism. the mechanisms of variationcrossover, random assortment of homologous chromosomes, and random fertilizationare present in all versions of sexual reproduction. the fact that nearly every multicellular organism on earth employs sexual reproduction is strong evidence for the benefits of producing offspring with unique gene combinations, though there are other possible benefits as well. nearly all eukaryotes undergo sexual reproduction. the variation introduced into the reproductive cells by meiosis appears to be one of the advantages of sexual reproduction that has made it so successful. meiosis and fertilization alternate in sexual life cycles. the process of meiosis produces unique reproductive cells called gametes, which have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. fertilization, the fusion of haploid gametes from two individuals, restores the diploid condition. thus, sexually reproducing organisms alternate between haploid and diploid stages. however, the ways in which reproductive cells are produced and the timing between meiosis and fertilization vary greatly. there are three main categories of life cycles: diploid-dominant, demonstrated by most animals; haploid-dominant, demonstrated by all fungi and some algae; and the alternation of generations, demonstrated by plants and some algae. leigh van valen, a new evolutionary law, evolutionary theory 1 (1973): 130","[('lifecycle', 'lifecycles'), ('sexual lifecycle', 'sexual lifecycles'), ('meiosi', 'meioses', 'meiosis'), ('sporophyte', 'sporophytes'), ('gametophyte', 'gametophytes'), ('diploid zygote', 'diploid zygotes'), ('diploid dominant', 'diploid dominants'), ('haploid dominant', 'haploid dominants'), ('red queen hypothesi', 'red queen hypotheses', 'red queen hypothesis', 'red queens hypothesi', 'red queens hypotheses', 'red queens hypothesis'), ('sexual reproduction', 'sexual reproductions'), ('alternation of generation', 'alternation of generations', 'alternation of generations', 'alternations of generation', 'alternations of generations', 'alternations of generations'), ('germ cell', 'germ cells')]"

58,stax-bio,12,Mendel's Experiments and Heredity,1,m44476,Mendel's Experiments and the Laws of Probability,"johann gregor mendel (18221884) ([link]) was a lifelong learner, teacher, scientist, and man of faith. as a young adult, he joined the augustinian abbey of st. thomas in brno in what is now the czech republic. supported by the monastery, he taught physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels. in 1856, he began a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system (a system with convenient characteristics used to study a specific biological phenomenon to be applied to other systems). in 1865, mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly 30,000 pea plants to the local natural history society. he demonstrated that traits are transmitted faithfully from parents to offspring independently of other traits and in dominant and recessive patterns. in 1866, he published his work, experiments in plant hybridization,1 in the proceedings of the natural history society of brnn. mendels work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community that believed, incorrectly, that the process of inheritance involved a blending of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring; this hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation. continuous variation results from the action of many genes to determine a characteristic like human height. offspring appear to be a blend of their parents traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation. the blending theory of inheritance asserted that the original parental traits were lost or absorbed by the blending in the offspring, but we now know that this is not the case. mendel was the first researcher to see it. instead of continuous characteristics, mendel worked with traits that were inherited in distinct classes (specifically, violet versus white flowers); this is referred to as discontinuous variation. mendels choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring, nor were they absorbed, but rather that they kept their distinctness and could be passed on. in 1868, mendel became abbot of the monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties. he was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific contributions during his lifetime. in fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity. mendels seminal work was accomplished using the garden pea, pisum sativum, to study inheritance. this species naturally self-fertilizes, such that pollen encounters ova within individual flowers. the flower petals remain sealed tightly until after pollination, preventing pollination from other plants. the result is highly inbred, or true-breeding, pea plants. these are plants that always produce offspring that look like the parent. by experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, mendel avoided the appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding. the garden pea also grows to maturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time. finally, large quantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing mendel to conclude that his results did not come about simply by chance. mendel performed hybridizations, which involve mating two true-breeding individuals that have different traits. in the pea, which is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety. in plants, pollen carries the male gametes (sperm) to the stigma, a sticky organ that traps pollen and allows the sperm to move down the pistil to the female gametes (ova) below. to prevent the pea plant that was receiving pollen from self-fertilizing and confounding his results, mendel painstakingly removed all of the anthers from the plants flowers before they had a chance to mature. plants used in first-generation crosses were called p0, or parental generation one, plants ([link]). mendel collected the seeds belonging to the p0 plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season. these offspring were called the f1, or the first filial (filial = offspring, daughter or son), generation. once mendel examined the characteristics in the f1 generation of plants, he allowed them to self-fertilize naturally. he then collected and grew the seeds from the f1 plants to produce the f2, or second filial, generation. mendels experiments extended beyond the f2 generation to the f3 and f4 generations, and so on, but it was the ratio of characteristics in the p0f1f2 generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis for mendels postulates. in his 1865 publication, mendel reported the results of his crosses involving seven different characteristics, each with two contrasting traits. a trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic. the characteristics included plant height, seed texture, seed color, flower color, pea pod size, pea pod color, and flower position. for the characteristic of flower color, for example, the two contrasting traits were white versus violet. to fully examine each characteristic, mendel generated large numbers of f1 and f2 plants, reporting results from 19,959 f2 plants alone. his findings were consistent. what results did mendel find in his crosses for flower color? first, mendel confirmed that he had plants that bred true for white or violet flower color. regardless of how many generations mendel examined, all self-crossed offspring of parents with white flowers had white flowers, and all self-crossed offspring of parents with violet flowers had violet flowers. in addition, mendel confirmed that, other than flower color, the pea plants were physically identical. once these validations were complete, mendel applied the pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers. after gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross, mendel found that 100 percent of the f1 hybrid generation had violet flowers. conventional wisdom at that time would have predicted the hybrid flowers to be pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white and violet flowers. in other words, the contrasting parental traits were expected to blend in the offspring. instead, mendels results demonstrated that the white flower trait in the f1 generation had completely disappeared. importantly, mendel did not stop his experimentation there. he allowed the f1 plants to self-fertilize and found that, of f2-generation plants, 705 had violet flowers and 224 had white flowers. this was a ratio of 3.15 violet flowers per one white flower, or approximately 3:1. when mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa, he obtained about the same ratio regardless of which parent, male or female, contributed which trait. this is called a reciprocal crossa paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross. for the other six characteristics mendel examined, the f1 and f2 generations behaved in the same way as they had for flower color. one of the two traits would disappear completely from the f1 generation only to reappear in the f2 generation at a ratio of approximately 3:1 ([link]). upon compiling his results for many thousands of plants, mendel concluded that the characteristics could be divided into expressed and latent traits. he called these, respectively, dominant and recessive traits. dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization. recessive traits become latent, or disappear, in the offspring of a hybridization. the recessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring. an example of a dominant trait is the violet-flower trait. for this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait. the fact that the recessive trait reappeared in the f2 generation meant that the traits remained separate (not blended) in the plants of the f1 generation. mendel also proposed that plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flower-color characteristic, and that each parent transmitted one of its two copies to its offspring, where they came together. moreover, the physical observation of a dominant trait could mean that the genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of the characteristic or that it included one dominant and one recessive version. conversely, the observation of a recessive trait meant that the organism lacked any dominant versions of this characteristic. so why did mendel repeatedly obtain 3:1 ratios in his crosses? to understand how mendel deduced the basic mechanisms of inheritance that lead to such ratios, we must first review the laws of probability. probabilities are mathematical measures of likelihood. the empirical probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of times the event occurs by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur. it is also possible to calculate theoretical probabilities by dividing the number of times that an event is expected to occur by the number of times that it could occur. empirical probabilities come from observations, like those of mendel. theoretical probabilities come from knowing how the events are produced and assuming that the probabilities of individual outcomes are equal. a probability of one for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a probability of zero indicates that it is guaranteed not to occur. an example of a genetic event is a round seed produced by a pea plant. in his experiment, mendel demonstrated that the probability of the event round seed occurring was one in the f1 offspring of true-breeding parents, one of which has round seeds and one of which has wrinkled seeds. when the f1 plants were subsequently self-crossed, the probability of any given f2 offspring having round seeds was now three out of four. in other words, in a large population of f2 offspring chosen at random, 75 percent were expected to have round seeds, whereas 25 percent were expected to have wrinkled seeds. using large numbers of crosses, mendel was able to calculate probabilities and use these to predict the outcomes of other crosses. mendel demonstrated that the pea-plant characteristics he studied were transmitted as discrete units from parent to offspring. as will be discussed, mendel also determined that different characteristics, like seed color and seed texture, were transmitted independently of one another and could be considered in separate probability analyses. for instance, performing a cross between a plant with green, wrinkled seeds and a plant with yellow, round seeds still produced offspring that had a 3:1 ratio of green:yellow seeds (ignoring seed texture) and a 3:1 ratio of round:wrinkled seeds (ignoring seed color). the characteristics of color and texture did not influence each other. the product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics. the product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone. to demonstrate the product rule, imagine that you are rolling a six-sided die (d) and flipping a penny (p) at the same time. the die may roll any number from 16 (d#), whereas the penny may turn up heads (ph) or tails (pt). the outcome of rolling the die has no effect on the outcome of flipping the penny and vice versa. there are 12 possible outcomes of this action ([link]), and each event is expected to occur with equal probability. of the 12 possible outcomes, the die has a 2/12 (or 1/6) probability of rolling a two, and the penny has a 6/12 (or 1/2) probability of coming up heads. by the product rule, the probability that you will obtain the combined outcome 2 and heads is: (d2) x (ph) = (1/6) x (1/2) or 1/12 ([link]). notice the word and in the description of the probability. the and is a signal to apply the product rule. for example, consider how the product rule is applied to the dihybrid cross: the probability of having both dominant traits in the f2 progeny is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant trait for each characteristic, as shown here: on the other hand, the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway. the sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event, of two mutually exclusive events, is the sum of their individual probabilities. notice the word or in the description of the probability. the or indicates that you should apply the sum rule. in this case, lets imagine you are flipping a penny (p) and a quarter (q). what is the probability of one coin coming up heads and one coin coming up tails? this outcome can be achieved by two cases: the penny may be heads (ph) and the quarter may be tails (qt), or the quarter may be heads (qh) and the penny may be tails (pt). either case fulfills the outcome. by the sum rule, we calculate the probability of obtaining one head and one tail as [(ph)  (qt)] + [(qh)  (pt)] = [(1/2)  (1/2)] + [(1/2)  (1/2)] = 1/2 ([link]). you should also notice that we used the product rule to calculate the probability of ph and qt, and also the probability of pt and qh, before we summed them. again, the sum rule can be applied to show the probability of having just one dominant trait in the f2 generation of a dihybrid cross: to use probability laws in practice, it is necessary to work with large sample sizes because small sample sizes are prone to deviations caused by chance. the large quantities of pea plants that mendel examined allowed him calculate the probabilities of the traits appearing in his f2 generation. as you will learn, this discovery meant that when parental traits were known, the offsprings traits could be predicted accurately even before fertilization. working with garden pea plants, mendel found that crosses between parents that differed by one trait produced f1 offspring that all expressed the traits of one parent. observable traits are referred to as dominant, and non-expressed traits are described as recessive. when the offspring in mendels experiment were self-crossed, the f2 offspring exhibited the dominant trait or the recessive trait in a 3:1 ratio, confirming that the recessive trait had been transmitted faithfully from the original p0 parent. reciprocal crosses generated identical f1 and f2 offspring ratios. by examining sample sizes, mendel showed that his crosses behaved reproducibly according to the laws of probability, and that the traits were inherited as independent events. two rules in probability can be used to find the expected proportions of offspring of different traits from different crosses. to find the probability of two or more independent events occurring together, apply the product rule and multiply the probabilities of the individual events. the use of the word and suggests the appropriate application of the product rule. to find the probability of two or more events occurring in combination, apply the sum rule and add their individual probabilities together. the use of the word or suggests the appropriate application of the sum rule. johann gregor mendel, versuche ber pflanzenhybriden

59,stax-bio,12,Mendel's Experiments and Heredity,2,m44478,Characteristics and Traits,"the seven characteristics that mendel evaluated in his pea plants were each expressed as one of two versions, or traits. the physical expression of characteristics is accomplished through the expression of genes carried on chromosomes. the genetic makeup of peas consists of two similar or homologous copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. each pair of homologous chromosomes has the same linear order of genes. in other words, peas are diploid organisms in that they have two copies of each chromosome. the same is true for many other plants and for virtually all animals. diploid organisms utilize meiosis to produce haploid gametes, which contain one copy of each homologous chromosome that unite at fertilization to create a diploid zygote. for cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic. gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called alleles. mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms, but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population. two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. the observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its phenotype. an organisms underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both physically visible and non-expressed alleles, is called its genotype. mendels hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. when true-breeding plants in which one parent had yellow pods and one had green pods were cross-fertilized, all of the f1 hybrid offspring had yellow pods. that is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow pods. however, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green pods was not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the f2 offspring. therefore, the f1 plants must have been genotypically different from the parent with yellow pods. the p1 plants that mendel used in his experiments were each homozygous for the trait he was studying. diploid organisms that are homozygous at a given gene, or locus, have two identical alleles for that gene on their homologous chromosomes. mendels parental pea plants always bred true because both of the gametes produced carried the same trait. when p1 plants with contrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring were heterozygous for the contrasting trait, meaning that their genotype reflected that they had different alleles for the gene being examined. our discussion of homozygous and heterozygous organisms brings us to why the f1 heterozygous offspring were identical to one of the parents, rather than expressing both alleles. in all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two contrasting alleles was dominant, and the other was recessive. mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive allele was referred to as the latent unit factor. we now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous chromosome pairs. for a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant and heterozygous organisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype). the recessive allele will only be observed in homozygous recessive individuals ([link]). several conventions exist for referring to genes and alleles. for the purposes of this chapter, we will abbreviate genes using the first letter of the genes corresponding dominant trait. for example, violet is the dominant trait for a pea plants flower color, so the flower-color gene would be abbreviated as v (note that it is customary to italicize gene designations). furthermore, we will use uppercase and lowercase letters to represent dominant and recessive alleles, respectively. therefore, we would refer to the genotype of a homozygous dominant pea plant with violet flowers as vv, a homozygous recessive pea plant with white flowers as vv, and a heterozygous pea plant with violet flowers as vv. when fertilization occurs between two true-breeding parents that differ in only one characteristic, the process is called a monohybrid cross, and the resulting offspring are monohybrids. mendel performed seven monohybrid crosses involving contrasting traits for each characteristic. on the basis of his results in f1 and f2 generations, mendel postulated that each parent in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination of unit factors was equally likely. to demonstrate a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green pea seeds. the dominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were yy for the plants with yellow seeds and yy for the plants with green seeds, respectively. a punnett square, devised by the british geneticist reginald punnett, can be drawn that applies the rules of probability to predict the possible outcomes of a genetic cross or mating and their expected frequencies. to prepare a punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles are listed along the top (for one parent) and side (for the other parent) of a grid, representing their meiotic segregation into haploid gametes. then the combinations of egg and sperm are made in the boxes in the table to show which alleles are combining. each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote, or fertilized egg, that could result from this mating. because each possibility is equally likely, genotypic ratios can be determined from a punnett square. if the pattern of inheritance (dominant or recessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be inferred as well. for a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents, each parent contributes one type of allele. in this case, only one genotype is possible. all offspring are yy and have yellow seeds ([link]). a self-cross of one of the yy heterozygous offspring can be represented in a 2  2 punnett square because each parent can donate one of two different alleles. therefore, the offspring can potentially have one of four allele combinations: yy, yy, yy, or yy ([link]). notice that there are two ways to obtain the yy genotype: a y from the egg and a y from the sperm, or a y from the egg and a y from the sperm. both of these possibilities must be counted. recall that mendels pea-plant characteristics behaved in the same way in reciprocal crosses. therefore, the two possible heterozygous combinations produce offspring that are genotypically and phenotypically identical despite their dominant and recessive alleles deriving from different parents. they are grouped together. because fertilization is a random event, we expect each combination to be equally likely and for the offspring to exhibit a ratio of yy:yy:yy genotypes of 1:2:1 ([link]). furthermore, because the yy and yy offspring have yellow seeds and are phenotypically identical, applying the sum rule of probability, we expect the offspring to exhibit a phenotypic ratio of 3 yellow:1 green. indeed, working with large sample sizes, mendel observed approximately this ratio in every f2 generation resulting from crosses for individual traits. mendel validated these results by performing an f3 cross in which he self-crossed the dominant- and recessive-expressing f2 plants. when he self-crossed the plants expressing green seeds, all of the offspring had green seeds, confirming that all green seeds had homozygous genotypes of yy. when he self-crossed the f2 plants expressing yellow seeds, he found that one-third of the plants bred true, and two-thirds of the plants segregated at a 3:1 ratio of yellow:green seeds. in this case, the true-breeding plants had homozygous (yy) genotypes, whereas the segregating plants corresponded to the heterozygous (yy) genotype. when these plants self-fertilized, the outcome was just like the f1 self-fertilizing cross. beyond predicting the offspring of a cross between known homozygous or heterozygous parents, mendel also developed a way to determine whether an organism that expressed a dominant trait was a heterozygote or a homozygote. called the test cross, this technique is still used by plant and animal breeders. in a test cross, the dominant-expressing organism is crossed with an organism that is homozygous recessive for the same characteristic. if the dominant-expressing organism is a homozygote, then all f1 offspring will be heterozygotes expressing the dominant trait ([link]). alternatively, if the dominant expressing organism is a heterozygote, the f1 offspring will exhibit a 1:1 ratio of heterozygotes and recessive homozygotes ([link]). the test cross further validates mendels postulate that pairs of unit factors segregate equally. many human diseases are genetically inherited. a healthy person in a family in which some members suffer from a recessive genetic disorder may want to know if he or she has the disease-causing gene and what risk exists of passing the disorder on to his or her offspring. of course, doing a test cross in humans is unethical and impractical. instead, geneticists use pedigree analysis to study the inheritance pattern of human genetic diseases ([link]). mendels experiments with pea plants suggested that: (1) two units or alleles exist for every gene; (2) alleles maintain their integrity in each generation (no blending); and (3) in the presence of the dominant allele, the recessive allele is hidden and makes no contribution to the phenotype. therefore, recessive alleles can be carried and not expressed by individuals. such heterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as carriers. further genetic studies in other plants and animals have shown that much more complexity exists, but that the fundamental principles of mendelian genetics still hold true. in the sections to follow, we consider some of the extensions of mendelism. if mendel had chosen an experimental system that exhibited these genetic complexities, its possible that he would not have understood what his results meant. mendels results, that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs, contradicted the view at that time that offspring exhibited a blend of their parents traits. however, the heterozygote phenotype occasionally does appear to be intermediate between the two parents. for example, in the snapdragon, antirrhinum majus ([link]), a cross between a homozygous parent with white flowers (cwcw) and a homozygous parent with red flowers (crcr) will produce offspring with pink flowers (crcw). (note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness.) this pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance, denoting the expression of two contrasting alleles such that the individual displays an intermediate phenotype. the allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers. however, the results of a heterozygote self-cross can still be predicted, just as with mendelian dominant and recessive crosses. in this case, the genotypic ratio would be 1 crcr:2 crcw:1 cwcw, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1 for red:pink:white. a variation on incomplete dominance is codominance, in which both alleles for the same characteristic are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote. an example of codominance is the mn blood groups of humans. the m and n alleles are expressed in the form of an m or n antigen present on the surface of red blood cells. homozygotes (lmlm and lnln) express either the m or the n allele, and heterozygotes (lmln) express both alleles equally. in a self-cross between heterozygotes expressing a codominant trait, the three possible offspring genotypes are phenotypically distinct. however, the 1:2:1 genotypic ratio characteristic of a mendelian monohybrid cross still applies. mendel implied that only two alleles, one dominant and one recessive, could exist for a given gene. we now know that this is an oversimplification. although individual humans (and all diploid organisms) can only have two alleles for a given gene, multiple alleles may exist at the population level such that many combinations of two alleles are observed. note that when many alleles exist for the same gene, the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype among wild animals as the wild type (often abbreviated +); this is considered the standard or norm. all other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants of this standard, meaning that they deviate from the wild type. the variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild-type allele. an example of multiple alleles is coat color in rabbits ([link]). here, four alleles exist for the c gene. the wild-type version, c+c+, is expressed as brown fur. the chinchilla phenotype, cchcch, is expressed as black-tipped white fur. the himalayan phenotype, chch, has black fur on the extremities and white fur elsewhere. finally, the albino, or colorless phenotype, cc, is expressed as white fur. in cases of multiple alleles, dominance hierarchies can exist. in this case, the wild-type allele is dominant over all the others, chinchilla is incompletely dominant over himalayan and albino, and himalayan is dominant over albino. this hierarchy, or allelic series, was revealed by observing the phenotypes of each possible heterozygote offspring. the complete dominance of a wild-type phenotype over all other mutants often occurs as an effect of dosage of a specific gene product, such that the wild-type allele supplies the correct amount of gene product whereas the mutant alleles cannot. for the allelic series in rabbits, the wild-type allele may supply a given dosage of fur pigment, whereas the mutants supply a lesser dosage or none at all. interestingly, the himalayan phenotype is the result of an allele that produces a temperature-sensitive gene product that only produces pigment in the cooler extremities of the rabbits body. alternatively, one mutant allele can be dominant over all other phenotypes, including the wild type. this may occur when the mutant allele somehow interferes with the genetic message so that even a heterozygote with one wild-type allele copy expresses the mutant phenotype. one way in which the mutant allele can interfere is by enhancing the function of the wild-type gene product or changing its distribution in the body. one example of this is the antennapedia mutation in drosophila ([link]). in this case, the mutant allele expands the distribution of the gene product, and as a result, the antennapedia heterozygote develops legs on its head where its antennae should be. multiple alleles confer drug resistance in the malaria parasitemalaria is a parasitic disease in humans that is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, including anopheles gambiae ([link]a), and is characterized by cyclic high fevers, chills, flu-like symptoms, and severe anemia. plasmodium falciparum and p. vivax are the most common causative agents of malaria, and p. falciparum is the most deadly ([link]b). when promptly and correctly treated, p. falciparum malaria has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent. however, in some parts of the world, the parasite has evolved resistance to commonly used malaria treatments, so the most effective malarial treatments can vary by geographic region. in southeast asia, africa, and south america, p. falciparum has developed resistance to the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine, mefloquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. p. falciparum, which is haploid during the life stage in which it is infectious to humans, has evolved multiple drug-resistant mutant alleles of the dhps gene. varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are associated with each of these alleles. being haploid, p. falciparum needs only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait. in southeast asia, different sulfadoxine-resistant alleles of the dhps gene are localized to different geographic regions. this is a common evolutionary phenomenon that occurs because drug-resistant mutants arise in a population and interbreed with other p. falciparum isolates in close proximity. sulfadoxine-resistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions where this drug is widely used as an over-the-counter malaria remedy. as is common with pathogens that multiply to large numbers within an infection cycle, p. falciparum evolves relatively rapidly (over a decade or so) in response to the selective pressure of commonly used anti-malarial drugs. for this reason, scientists must constantly work to develop new drugs or drug combinations to combat the worldwide malaria burden.1 in humans, as well as in many other animals and some plants, the sex of the individual is determined by sex chromosomes. the sex chromosomes are one pair of non-homologous chromosomes. until now, we have only considered inheritance patterns among non-sex chromosomes, or autosomes. in addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, human females have a homologous pair of x chromosomes, whereas human males have an xy chromosome pair. although the y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the x chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis, the y chromosome is much shorter and contains many fewer genes. when a gene being examined is present on the x chromosome, but not on the y chromosome, it is said to be x-linked. eye color in drosophila was one of the first x-linked traits to be identified. thomas hunt morgan mapped this trait to the x chromosome in 1910. like humans, drosophila males have an xy chromosome pair, and females are xx. in flies, the wild-type eye color is red (xw) and it is dominant to white eye color (xw) ([link]). because of the location of the eye-color gene, reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios. males are said to be hemizygous, because they have only one allele for any x-linked characteristic. hemizygosity makes the descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for xy males. drosophila males lack a second allele copy on the y chromosome; that is, their genotype can only be xwy or xwy. in contrast, females have two allele copies of this gene and can be xwxw, xwxw, or xwxw. in an x-linked cross, the genotypes of f1 and f2 offspring depend on whether the recessive trait was expressed by the male or the female in the p1 generation. with regard to drosophila eye color, when the p1 male expresses the white-eye phenotype and the female is homozygous red-eyed, all members of the f1 generation exhibit red eyes ([link]). the f1 females are heterozygous (xwxw), and the males are all xwy, having received their x chromosome from the homozygous dominant p1 female and their y chromosome from the p1 male. a subsequent cross between the xwxw female and the xwy male would produce only red-eyed females (with xwxw or xwxw genotypes) and both red- and white-eyed males (with xwy or xwy genotypes). now, consider a cross between a homozygous white-eyed female and a male with red eyes. the f1 generation would exhibit only heterozygous red-eyed females (xwxw) and only white-eyed males (xwy). half of the f2 females would be red-eyed (xwxw) and half would be white-eyed (xwxw). similarly, half of the f2 males would be red-eyed (xwy) and half would be white-eyed (xwy). discoveries in fruit fly genetics can be applied to human genetics.  when a female parent is homozygous for a recessive x-linked trait, she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her offspring. her male offspring are, therefore, destined to express the trait, as they will inherit their father's y chromosome. in humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some forms of color blindness, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are x-linked. females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to be carriers and may not exhibit any phenotypic effects. these females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass carrier status to half of their daughters; therefore, recessive x-linked traits appear more frequently in males than females. in some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the sex with the non-homologous sex chromosomes is the female rather than the male. this is the case for all birds. in this case, sex-linked traits will be more likely to appear in the female, in which they are hemizygous. sex-linkage studies in morgans laboratory provided the fundamentals for understanding x-linked recessive disorders in humans, which include red-green color blindness, and types a and b hemophilia. because human males need to inherit only one recessive mutant x allele to be affected, x-linked disorders are disproportionately observed in males. females must inherit recessive x-linked alleles from both of their parents in order to express the trait. when they inherit one recessive x-linked mutant allele and one dominant x-linked wild-type allele, they are carriers of the trait and are typically unaffected. carrier females can manifest mild forms of the trait due to the inactivation of the dominant allele located on one of the x chromosomes. however, female carriers can contribute the trait to their sons, resulting in the son exhibiting the trait, or they can contribute the recessive allele to their daughters, resulting in the daughters being carriers of the trait ([link]). although some y-linked recessive disorders exist, typically they are associated with infertility in males and are therefore not transmitted to subsequent generations.  watch this video to learn more about sex-linked traits.

 a large proportion of genes in an individuals genome are essential for survival. occasionally, a nonfunctional allele for an essential gene can arise by mutation and be transmitted in a population as long as individuals with this allele also have a wild-type, functional copy. the wild-type allele functions at a capacity sufficient to sustain life and is therefore considered to be dominant over the nonfunctional allele. however, consider two heterozygous parents that have a genotype of wild-type/nonfunctional mutant for a hypothetical essential gene. in one quarter of their offspring, we would expect to observe individuals that are homozygous recessive for the nonfunctional allele. because the gene is essential, these individuals might fail to develop past fertilization, die in utero, or die later in life, depending on what life stage requires this gene. an inheritance pattern in which an allele is only lethal in the homozygous form and in which the heterozygote may be normal or have some altered non-lethal phenotype is referred to as recessive lethal. for crosses between heterozygous individuals with a recessive lethal allele that causes death before birth when homozygous, only wild-type homozygotes and heterozygotes would be observed. the genotypic ratio would therefore be 2:1. in other instances, the recessive lethal allele might also exhibit a dominant (but not lethal) phenotype in the heterozygote. for instance, the recessive lethal curly allele in drosophila affects wing shape in the heterozygote form but is lethal in the homozygote. a single copy of the wild-type allele is not always sufficient for normal functioning or even survival. the dominant lethal inheritance pattern is one in which an allele is lethal both in the homozygote and the heterozygote; this allele can only be transmitted if the lethality phenotype occurs after reproductive age. individuals with mutations that result in dominant lethal alleles fail to survive even in the heterozygote form. dominant lethal alleles are very rare because, as you might expect, the allele only lasts one generation and is not transmitted. however, just as the recessive lethal allele might not immediately manifest the phenotype of death, dominant lethal alleles also might not be expressed until adulthood. once the individual reaches reproductive age, the allele may be unknowingly passed on, resulting in a delayed death in both generations. an example of this in humans is huntingtons disease, in which the nervous system gradually wastes away ([link]). people who are heterozygous for the dominant huntington allele (hh) will inevitably develop the fatal disease. however, the onset of huntingtons disease may not occur until age 40, at which point the afflicted persons may have already passed the allele to 50 percent of their offspring. when true-breeding or homozygous individuals that differ for a certain trait are crossed, all of the offspring will be heterozygotes for that trait. if the traits are inherited as dominant and recessive, the f1 offspring will all exhibit the same phenotype as the parent homozygous for the dominant trait. if these heterozygous offspring are self-crossed, the resulting f2 offspring will be equally likely to inherit gametes carrying the dominant or recessive trait, giving rise to offspring of which one quarter are homozygous dominant, half are heterozygous, and one quarter are homozygous recessive. because homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals are phenotypically identical, the observed traits in the f2 offspring will exhibit a ratio of three dominant to one recessive. alleles do not always behave in dominant and recessive patterns. incomplete dominance describes situations in which the heterozygote exhibits a phenotype that is intermediate between the homozygous phenotypes. codominance describes the simultaneous expression of both of the alleles in the heterozygote. although diploid organisms can only have two alleles for any given gene, it is common for more than two alleles of a gene to exist in a population. in humans, as in many animals and some plants, females have two x chromosomes and males have one x and one y chromosome. genes that are present on the x but not the y chromosome are said to be x-linked, such that males only inherit one allele for the gene, and females inherit two. finally, some alleles can be lethal. recessive lethal alleles are only lethal in homozygotes, but dominant lethal alleles are fatal in heterozygotes as well. sumiti vinayak, et al., origin and evolution of sulfadoxine resistant plasmodium falciparum, public library of science pathogens 6, no. 3 (2010): e1000830, doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000830.","[('test cros', 'test crosses', 'test cross'), ('monohybrid', 'monohybrids'), ('recessive gene', 'recessive genes'), ('punnett square', 'punnett squares'), ('dominant lethal', 'dominant lethals'), ('polygenic inheritance', 'polygenic inheritances'), ('gregor mendel', 'gregor mendels'), ('mendel', 'mendels'), ('genetic', 'geneticss', 'genetics'), ('dominant phenotype', 'dominant phenotypes'), ('sex linkage', 'sex linkages'), ('homozygou', 'homozygouss', 'homozygous'), ('x linkage', 'x linkages'), ('heterozygou', 'heterozygouss', 'heterozygous'), ('sex-linked trait', 'sex-linked traits'), ('wild type', 'wild types'), ('mutant', 'mutants'), ('monohybrid cros', 'monohybrid crosses', 'monohybrid cross'), ('hemizygou', 'hemizygouss', 'hemizygous'), ('multiple allele', 'multiple alleless', 'multiple alleles'), ('incomplete dominance', 'incomplete dominances'), ('characteristic', 'characteristics'), ('recessive lethal', 'recessive lethals'), ('codominance', 'codominances'), ('heredity', 'heredities'), ('x-linked trait', 'x-linked traits'), ('genotype', 'genotypes'), ('lethality', 'lethalities'), ('trait', 'traits'), ('allele', 'alleles'), ('phenotype', 'phenotypes'), ('pedigree analysi', 'pedigree analyses', 'pedigree analysis')]"
60,stax-bio,12,Mendel's Experiments and Heredity,3,m44479,Laws of Inheritance,"mendel generalized the results of his pea-plant experiments into four postulates, some of which are sometimes called laws, that describe the basis of dominant and recessive inheritance in diploid organisms. as you have learned, more complex extensions of mendelism exist that do not exhibit the same f2 phenotypic ratios (3:1). nevertheless, these laws summarize the basics of classical genetics. mendel proposed first that paired unit factors of heredity were transmitted faithfully from generation to generation by the dissociation and reassociation of paired factors during gametogenesis and fertilization, respectively. after he crossed peas with contrasting traits and found that the recessive trait resurfaced in the f2 generation, mendel deduced that hereditary factors must be inherited as discrete units. this finding contradicted the belief at that time that parental traits were blended in the offspring. mendels law of dominance states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic. rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively. the recessive allele will remain latent but will be transmitted to offspring by the same manner in which the dominant allele is transmitted. the recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that have two copies of this allele ([link]), and these offspring will breed true when self-crossed. since mendels experiments with pea plants, other researchers have found that the law of dominance does not always hold true. instead, several different patterns of inheritance have been found to exist. observing that true-breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to f1 generations that all expressed the dominant trait and f2 generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio, mendel proposed the law of segregation. this law states that paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor. for the f2 generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three possible combinations of genotypes could result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive. because heterozygotes could arise from two different pathways (receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent), and because heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical, the law supports mendels observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio. the equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the punnett square to accurately predict the offspring of parents with known genotypes. the physical basis of mendels law of segregation is the first division of meiosis, in which the homologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter nuclei.  the role of the meiotic segregation of chromosomes in sexual reproduction was not understood by the scientific community during mendels lifetime. mendels law of independent assortment states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes, and every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur. the independent assortment of genes can be illustrated by the dihybrid cross, a cross between two true-breeding parents that express different traits for two characteristics. consider the characteristics of seed color and seed texture for two pea plants, one that has green, wrinkled seeds (yyrr) and another that has yellow, round seeds (yyrr). because each parent is homozygous, the law of segregation indicates that the gametes for the green/wrinkled plant all are yr, and the gametes for the yellow/round plant are all yr. therefore, the f1 generation of offspring all are yyrr ([link]). for the f2 generation, the law of segregation requires that each gamete receive either an r allele or an r allele along with either a y allele or a y allele. the law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which an r allele sorted would be equally likely to contain either a y allele or a y allele. thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed when the yyrr heterozygote is self-crossed, as follows: yr, yr, yr, and yr. arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4  4 punnett square ([link]) gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations. from these genotypes, we infer a phenotypic ratio of 9 round/yellow:3 round/green:3 wrinkled/yellow:1 wrinkled/green ([link]). these are the offspring ratios we would expect, assuming we performed the crosses with a large enough sample size. because of independent assortment and dominance, the 9:3:3:1 dihybrid phenotypic ratio can be collapsed into two 3:1 ratios, characteristic of any monohybrid cross that follows a dominant and recessive pattern. ignoring seed color and considering only seed texture in the above dihybrid cross, we would expect that three quarters of the f2 generation offspring would be round, and one quarter would be wrinkled. similarly, isolating only seed color, we would assume that three quarters of the f2 offspring would be yellow and one quarter would be green. the sorting of alleles for texture and color are independent events, so we can apply the product rule. therefore, the proportion of round and yellow f2 offspring is expected to be (3/4)  (3/4) = 9/16, and the proportion of wrinkled and green offspring is expected to be (1/4)  (1/4) = 1/16. these proportions are identical to those obtained using a punnett square. round, green and wrinkled, yellow offspring can also be calculated using the product rule, as each of these genotypes includes one dominant and one recessive phenotype. therefore, the proportion of each is calculated as (3/4)  (1/4) = 3/16. the law of independent assortment also indicates that a cross between yellow, wrinkled (yyrr) and green, round (yyrr) parents would yield the same f1 and f2 offspring as in the yyrr x yyrr cross. the physical basis for the law of independent assortment also lies in meiosis i, in which the different homologous pairs line up in random orientations. each gamete can contain any combination of paternal and maternal chromosomes (and therefore the genes on them) because the orientation of tetrads on the metaphase plane is random. when more than two genes are being considered, the punnett-square method becomes unwieldy. for instance, examining a cross involving four genes would require a 16  16 grid containing 256 boxes. it would be extremely cumbersome to manually enter each genotype. for more complex crosses, the forked-line and probability methods are preferred. to prepare a forked-line diagram for a cross between f1 heterozygotes resulting from a cross between aabbcc and aabbcc parents, we first create rows equal to the number of genes being considered, and then segregate the alleles in each row on forked lines according to the probabilities for individual monohybrid crosses ([link]). we then multiply the values along each forked path to obtain the f2 offspring probabilities. note that this process is a diagrammatic version of the product rule. the values along each forked pathway can be multiplied because each gene assorts independently. for a trihybrid cross, the f2 phenotypic ratio is 27:9:9:9:3:3:3:1. while the forked-line method is a diagrammatic approach to keeping track of probabilities in a cross, the probability method gives the proportions of offspring expected to exhibit each phenotype (or genotype) without the added visual assistance. both methods make use of the product rule and consider the alleles for each gene separately. earlier, we examined the phenotypic proportions for a trihybrid cross using the forked-line method; now we will use the probability method to examine the genotypic proportions for a cross with even more genes. for a trihybrid cross, writing out the forked-line method is tedious, albeit not as tedious as using the punnett-square method. to fully demonstrate the power of the probability method, however, we can consider specific genetic calculations. for instance, for a tetrahybrid cross between individuals that are heterozygotes for all four genes, and in which all four genes are sorting independently and in a dominant and recessive pattern, what proportion of the offspring will be expected to be homozygous recessive for all four alleles? rather than writing out every possible genotype, we can use the probability method. we know that for each gene, the fraction of homozygous recessive offspring will be 1/4. therefore, multiplying this fraction for each of the four genes, (1/4)  (1/4)  (1/4)  (1/4), we determine that 1/256 of the offspring will be quadruply homozygous recessive. for the same tetrahybrid cross, what is the expected proportion of offspring that have the dominant phenotype at all four loci? we can answer this question using phenotypic proportions, but lets do it the hard wayusing genotypic proportions. the question asks for the proportion of offspring that are 1) homozygous dominant at a or heterozygous at a, and 2) homozygous at b or heterozygous at b, and so on. noting the or and and in each circumstance makes clear where to apply the sum and product rules. the probability of a homozygous dominant at a is 1/4 and the probability of a heterozygote at a is 1/2. the probability of the homozygote or the heterozygote is 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 using the sum rule. the same probability can be obtained in the same way for each of the other genes, so that the probability of a dominant phenotype at a and b and c and d is, using the product rule, equal to 3/4  3/4  3/4  3/4, or 27/64. if you are ever unsure about how to combine probabilities, returning to the forked-line method should make it clear. predicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring from given crosses is the best way to test your knowledge of mendelian genetics. given a multihybrid cross that obeys independent assortment and follows a dominant and recessive pattern, several generalized rules exist; you can use these rules to check your results as you work through genetics calculations ([link]). to apply these rules, first you must determine n, the number of heterozygous gene pairs (the number of genes segregating two alleles each). for example, a cross between aabb and aabb heterozygotes has an n of 2. in contrast, a cross between aabb and aabb has an n of 1 because a is not heterozygous. although all of mendels pea characteristics behaved according to the law of independent assortment, we now know that some allele combinations are not inherited independently of each other. genes that are located on separate non-homologous chromosomes will always sort independently. however, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes, organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string. the segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage, in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair. however, because of the process of recombination, or crossover, it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently, or as if they are not linked. to understand this, lets consider the biological basis of gene linkage and recombination. homologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same linear order. the alleles may differ on homologous chromosome pairs, but the genes to which they correspond do not. in preparation for the first division of meiosis, homologous chromosomes replicate and synapse. like genes on the homologs align with each other. at this stage, segments of homologous chromosomes exchange linear segments of genetic material ([link]). this process is called recombination, or crossover, and it is a common genetic process. because the genes are aligned during recombination, the gene order is not altered. instead, the result of recombination is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the same chromosome. across a given chromosome, several recombination events may occur, causing extensive shuffling of alleles. when two genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, they are considered linked, and their alleles tend to be transmitted through meiosis together. to exemplify this, imagine a dihybrid cross involving flower color and plant height in which the genes are next to each other on the chromosome. if one homologous chromosome has alleles for tall plants and red flowers, and the other chromosome has genes for short plants and yellow flowers, then when the gametes are formed, the tall and red alleles will go together into a gamete and the short and yellow alleles will go into other gametes. these are called the parental genotypes because they have been inherited intact from the parents of the individual producing gametes. but unlike if the genes were on different chromosomes, there will be no gametes with tall and yellow alleles and no gametes with short and red alleles. if you create the punnett square with these gametes, you will see that the classical mendelian prediction of a 9:3:3:1 outcome of a dihybrid cross would not apply. as the distance between two genes increases, the probability of one or more crossovers between them increases, and the genes behave more like they are on separate chromosomes. geneticists have used the proportion of recombinant gametes (the ones not like the parents) as a measure of how far apart genes are on a chromosome. using this information, they have constructed elaborate maps of genes on chromosomes for well-studied organisms, including humans. mendels seminal publication makes no mention of linkage, and many researchers have questioned whether he encountered linkage but chose not to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his independent assortment postulate. the garden pea has seven chromosomes, and some have suggested that his choice of seven characteristics was not a coincidence. however, even if the genes he examined were not located on separate chromosomes, it is possible that he simply did not observe linkage because of the extensive shuffling effects of recombination. testing the hypothesis of independent assortmentto better appreciate the amount of labor and ingenuity that went into mendels experiments, proceed through one of mendels dihybrid crosses. question: what will be the offspring of a dihybrid cross? background: consider that pea plants mature in one growing season, and you have access to a large garden in which you can cultivate thousands of pea plants. there are several true-breeding plants with the following pairs of traits: tall plants with inflated pods, and dwarf plants with constricted pods. before the plants have matured, you remove the pollen-producing organs from the tall/inflated plants in your crosses to prevent self-fertilization. upon plant maturation, the plants are manually crossed by transferring pollen from the dwarf/constricted plants to the stigmata of the tall/inflated plants. hypothesis: both trait pairs will sort independently according to mendelian laws. when the true-breeding parents are crossed, all of the f1 offspring are tall and have inflated pods, which indicates that the tall and inflated traits are dominant over the dwarf and constricted traits, respectively. a self-cross of the f1 heterozygotes results in 2,000 f2 progeny. test the hypothesis: because each trait pair sorts independently, the ratios of tall:dwarf and inflated:constricted are each expected to be 3:1. the tall/dwarf trait pair is called t/t, and the inflated/constricted trait pair is designated i/i. each member of the f1 generation therefore has a genotype of ttii. construct a grid analogous to [link], in which you cross two ttii individuals. each individual can donate four combinations of two traits: ti, ti, ti, or ti, meaning that there are 16 possibilities of offspring genotypes. because the t and i alleles are dominant, any individual having one or two of those alleles will express the tall or inflated phenotypes, respectively, regardless if they also have a t or i allele. only individuals that are tt or ii will express the dwarf and constricted alleles, respectively. as shown in [link], you predict that you will observe the following offspring proportions: tall/inflated:tall/constricted:dwarf/inflated:dwarf/constricted in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. notice from the grid that when considering the tall/dwarf and inflated/constricted trait pairs in isolation, they are each inherited in 3:1 ratios. test the hypothesis: you cross the dwarf and tall plants and then self-cross the offspring. for best results, this is repeated with hundreds or even thousands of pea plants. what special precautions should be taken in the crosses and in growing the plants? analyze your data: you observe the following plant phenotypes in the f2 generation: 2706 tall/inflated, 930 tall/constricted, 888 dwarf/inflated, and 300 dwarf/constricted. reduce these findings to a ratio and determine if they are consistent with mendelian laws. form a conclusion: were the results close to the expected 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio? do the results support the prediction? what might be observed if far fewer plants were used, given that alleles segregate randomly into gametes? try to imagine growing that many pea plants, and consider the potential for experimental error. for instance, what would happen if it was extremely windy one day? mendels studies in pea plants implied that the sum of an individuals phenotype was controlled by genes (or as he called them, unit factors), such that every characteristic was distinctly and completely controlled by a single gene. in fact, single observable characteristics are almost always under the influence of multiple genes (each with two or more alleles) acting in unison. for example, at least eight genes contribute to eye color in humans. in some cases, several genes can contribute to aspects of a common phenotype without their gene products ever directly interacting. in the case of organ development, for instance, genes may be expressed sequentially, with each gene adding to the complexity and specificity of the organ. genes may function in complementary or synergistic fashions, such that two or more genes need to be expressed simultaneously to affect a phenotype. genes may also oppose each other, with one gene modifying the expression of another. in epistasis, the interaction between genes is antagonistic, such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another. epistasis is a word composed of greek roots that mean standing upon. the alleles that are being masked or silenced are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking. often the biochemical basis of epistasis is a gene pathway in which the expression of one gene is dependent on the function of a gene that precedes or follows it in the pathway. an example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice. the wild-type coat color, agouti (aa), is dominant to solid-colored fur (aa). however, a separate gene (c) is necessary for pigment production. a mouse with a recessive c allele at this locus is unable to produce pigment and is albino regardless of the allele present at locus a ([link]). therefore, the genotypes aacc, aacc, and aacc all produce the same albino phenotype. a cross between heterozygotes for both genes (aacc x aacc) would generate offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 9 agouti:3 solid color:4 albino ([link]). in this case, the c gene is epistatic to the a gene. epistasis can also occur when a dominant allele masks expression at a separate gene. fruit color in summer squash is expressed in this way. homozygous recessive expression of the w gene (ww) coupled with homozygous dominant or heterozygous expression of the y gene (yy or yy) generates yellow fruit, and the wwyy genotype produces green fruit. however, if a dominant copy of the w gene is present in the homozygous or heterozygous form, the summer squash will produce white fruit regardless of the y alleles. a cross between white heterozygotes for both genes (wwyy  wwyy) would produce offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 12 white:3 yellow:1 green. finally, epistasis can be reciprocal such that either gene, when present in the dominant (or recessive) form, expresses the same phenotype. in the shepherds purse plant (capsella bursa-pastoris), the characteristic of seed shape is controlled by two genes in a dominant epistatic relationship. when the genes a and b are both homozygous recessive (aabb), the seeds are ovoid. if the dominant allele for either of these genes is present, the result is triangular seeds. that is, every possible genotype other than aabb results in triangular seeds, and a cross between heterozygotes for both genes (aabb x aabb) would yield offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 15 triangular:1 ovoid. as you work through genetics problems, keep in mind that any single characteristic that results in a phenotypic ratio that totals 16 is typical of a two-gene interaction. recall the phenotypic inheritance pattern for mendels dihybrid cross, which considered two non-interacting genes9:3:3:1. similarly, we would expect interacting gene pairs to also exhibit ratios expressed as 16 parts. note that we are assuming the interacting genes are not linked; they are still assorting independently into gametes. mendel postulated that genes (characteristics) are inherited as pairs of alleles (traits) that behave in a dominant and recessive pattern. alleles segregate into gametes such that each gamete is equally likely to receive either one of the two alleles present in a diploid individual. in addition, genes are assorted into gametes independently of one another. that is, alleles are generally not more likely to segregate into a gamete with a particular allele of another gene. a dihybrid cross demonstrates independent assortment when the genes in question are on different chromosomes or distant from each other on the same chromosome. for crosses involving more than two genes, use the forked line or probability methods to predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes rather than a punnett square. although chromosomes sort independently into gametes during meiosis, mendels law of independent assortment refers to genes, not chromosomes, and a single chromosome may carry more than 1,000 genes. when genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, their alleles tend to be inherited together. this results in offspring ratios that violate mendel's law of independent assortment. however, recombination serves to exchange genetic material on homologous chromosomes such that maternal and paternal alleles may be recombined on the same chromosome. this is why alleles on a given chromosome are not always inherited together. recombination is a random event occurring anywhere on a chromosome. therefore, genes that are far apart on the same chromosome are likely to still assort independently because of recombination events that occurred in the intervening chromosomal space. whether or not they are sorting independently, genes may interact at the level of gene products such that the expression of an allele for one gene masks or modifies the expression of an allele for a different gene. this is called epistasis.","[('law of inheritance', 'law of inheritance', 'laws of inheritance', 'laws of inheritance'), ('forked-line method', 'forked-line methods'), ('law of independent assortment', 'law of

62,stax-bio,13,Modern Undersatndings of Inheritance,1,m44481,Chromosomal Theory and Genetic Linkage,"long before chromosomes were visualized under a microscope, the father of modern genetics, gregor mendel, began studying heredity in 1843. with the improvement of microscopic techniques during the late 1800s, cell biologists could stain and visualize subcellular structures with dyes and observe their actions during cell division and meiosis. with each mitotic division, chromosomes replicated, condensed from an amorphous (no constant shape) nuclear mass into distinct x-shaped bodies (pairs of identical sister chromatids), and migrated to separate cellular poles. the speculation that chromosomes might be the key to understanding heredity led several scientists to examine mendels publications and re-evaluate his model in terms of the behavior of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. in 1902, theodor boveri observed that proper embryonic development of sea urchins does not occur unless chromosomes are present. that same year, walter sutton observed the separation of chromosomes into daughter cells during meiosis ([link]). together, these observations led to the development of the chromosomal theory of inheritance, which identified chromosomes as the genetic material responsible for mendelian inheritance. the chromosomal theory of inheritance was consistent with mendels laws and was supported by the following observations: despite compelling correlations between the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and mendels abstract laws, the chromosomal theory of inheritance was proposed long before there was any direct evidence that traits were carried on chromosomes. critics pointed out that individuals had far more independently segregating traits than they had chromosomes. it was only after several years of carrying out crosses with the fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster, that thomas hunt morgan provided experimental evidence to support the chromosomal theory of inheritance. mendels work suggested that traits are inherited independently of each other. morgan identified a 1:1 correspondence between a segregating trait and the x chromosome, suggesting that the random segregation of chromosomes was the physical basis of mendels model. this also demonstrated that linked genes disrupt mendels predicted outcomes. the fact that each chromosome can carry many linked genes explains how individuals can have many more traits than they have chromosomes. however, observations by researchers in morgans laboratory suggested that alleles positioned on the same chromosome were not always inherited together. during meiosis, linked genes somehow became unlinked. in 1909, frans janssen observed chiasmatathe point at which chromatids are in contact with each other and may exchange segmentsprior to the first division of meiosis. he suggested that alleles become unlinked and chromosomes physically exchange segments. as chromosomes condensed and paired with their homologs, they appeared to interact at distinct points. janssen suggested that these points corresponded to regions in which chromosome segments were exchanged. it is now known that the pairing and interaction between homologous chromosomes, known as synapsis, does more than simply organize the homologs for migration to separate daughter cells. when synapsed, homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal physical exchanges at their arms in a process called homologous recombination, or more simply, crossing over. to better understand the type of experimental results that researchers were obtaining at this time, consider a heterozygous individual that inherited dominant maternal alleles for two genes on the same chromosome (such as ab) and two recessive paternal alleles for those same genes (such as ab). if the genes are linked, one would expect this individual to produce gametes that are either ab or ab with a 1:1 ratio. if the genes are unlinked, the individual should produce ab, ab, ab, and ab gametes with equal frequencies, according to the mendelian concept of independent assortment. because they correspond to new allele combinations, the genotypes ab and ab are nonparental types that result from homologous recombination during meiosis. parental types are progeny that exhibit the same allelic combination as their parents. morgan and his colleagues, however, found that when such heterozygous individuals were test crossed to a homozygous recessive parent (aabb  aabb), both parental and nonparental cases occurred. for example, 950 offspring might be recovered that were either aabb or aabb, but 50 offspring would also be obtained that were either aabb or aabb. these results suggested that linkage occurred most often, but a significant minority of offspring were the products of recombination. janssen did not have the technology to demonstrate crossing over so it remained an abstract idea that was not widely accepted. scientists thought chiasmata were a variation on synapsis and could not understand how chromosomes could break and rejoin. yet, the data were clear that linkage did not always occur. ultimately, it took a young undergraduate student and an all-nighter to mathematically elucidate the problem of linkage and recombination. in 1913, alfred sturtevant, a student in morgans laboratory, gathered results from researchers in the laboratory, and took them home one night to mull them over. by the next morning, he had created the first chromosome map, a linear representation of gene order and relative distance on a chromosome ([link]). as shown in [link], by using recombination frequency to predict genetic distance, the relative order of genes on chromosome 2 could be inferred. the values shown represent map distances in centimorgans (cm), which correspond to recombination frequencies (in percent). therefore, the genes for body color and wing size were 65.5  48.5 = 17 cm apart, indicating that the maternal and paternal alleles for these genes recombine in 17 percent of offspring, on average. to construct a chromosome map, sturtevant assumed that genes were ordered serially on threadlike chromosomes. he also assumed that the incidence of recombination between two homologous chromosomes could occur with equal likelihood anywhere along the length of the chromosome. operating under these assumptions, sturtevant postulated that alleles that were far apart on a chromosome were more likely to dissociate during meiosis simply because there was a larger region over which recombination could occur. conversely, alleles that were close to each other on the chromosome were likely to be inherited together. the average number of crossovers between two allelesthat is, their recombination frequencycorrelated with their genetic distance from each other, relative to the locations of other genes on that chromosome. considering the example cross between aabb and aabb above, the frequency of recombination could be calculated as 50/1000 = 0.05. that is, the likelihood of a crossover between genes a/a and b/b was 0.05, or 5 percent. such a result would indicate that the genes were definitively linked, but that they were far enough apart for crossovers to occasionally occur. sturtevant divided his genetic map into map units, or centimorgans (cm), in which a recombination frequency of 0.01 corresponds to 1 cm. by representing alleles in a linear map, sturtevant suggested that genes can range from being perfectly linked (recombination frequency = 0) to being perfectly unlinked (recombination frequency = 0.5) when genes are on different chromosomes or genes are separated very far apart on the same chromosome. perfectly unlinked genes correspond to the frequencies predicted by mendel to assort independently in a dihybrid cross. a recombination frequency of 0.5 indicates that 50 percent of offspring are recombinants and the other 50 percent are parental types. that is, every type of allele combination is represented with equal frequency. this representation allowed sturtevant to additively calculate distances between several genes on the same chromosome. however, as the genetic distances approached 0.50, his predictions became less accurate because it was not clear whether the genes were very far apart on the same chromosome or on different chromosomes. in 1931, barbara mcclintock and harriet creighton demonstrated the crossover of homologous chromosomes in corn plants. weeks later, homologous recombination in drosophila was demonstrated microscopically by curt stern. stern observed several x-linked phenotypes that were associated with a structurally unusual and dissimilar x chromosome pair in which one x was missing a small terminal segment, and the other x was fused to a piece of the y chromosome. by crossing flies, observing their offspring, and then visualizing the offsprings chromosomes, stern demonstrated that every time the offspring allele combination deviated from either of the parental combinations, there was a corresponding exchange of an x chromosome segment. using mutant flies with structurally distinct x chromosomes was the key to observing the products of recombination because dna sequencing and other molecular tools were not yet available. it is now known that homologous chromosomes regularly exchange segments in meiosis by reciprocally breaking and rejoining their dna at precise locations. homologous recombination is a common genetic process, yet mendel never observed it. had he investigated both linked and unlinked genes, it would have been much more difficult for him to create a unified model of his data on the basis of probabilistic calculations. researchers who have since mapped the seven traits investigated by mendel onto the seven chromosomes of the pea plant genome have confirmed that all of the genes he examined are either on separate chromosomes or are sufficiently far apart as to be statistically unlinked. some have suggested that mendel was enormously lucky to select only unlinked genes, whereas others question whether mendel discarded any data suggesting linkage. in any case, mendel consistently observed independent assortment because he examined genes that were effectively unlinked. the chromosomal theory of inheritance, proposed by sutton and boveri, states that chromosomes are the vehicles of genetic heredity. neither mendelian genetics nor gene linkage is perfectly accurate; instead, chromosome behavior involves segregation, independent assortment, and occasionally, linkage. sturtevant devised a method to assess recombination frequency and infer the relative positions and distances of linked genes on a chromosome on the basis of the average number of crossovers in the intervening region between the genes. sturtevant correctly presumed that genes are arranged in serial order on chromosomes and that recombination between homologs can occur anywhere on a chromosome with equal likelihood. whereas linkage causes alleles on the same chromosome to be inherited together, homologous recombination biases alleles toward an inheritance pattern of independent assortment.","[('crossing over', 'crossing over'), ('genetic map', 'genetic maps'), ('recombination frequency', 'recombination frequencies'), ('parental

63,stax-bio,13,Modern Undersatndings of Inheritance,2,m44483,Chromosomal Basis of Inherited Disorders,"inherited disorders can arise when chromosomes behave abnormally during meiosis. chromosome disorders can be divided into two categories: abnormalities in chromosome number and chromosomal structural rearrangements. because even small segments of chromosomes can span many genes, chromosomal disorders are characteristically dramatic and often fatal. the isolation and microscopic observation of chromosomes forms the basis of cytogenetics and is the primary method by which clinicians detect chromosomal abnormalities in humans. a karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes, and includes their length, banding pattern, and centromere position. to obtain a view of an individuals karyotype, cytologists photograph the chromosomes and then cut and paste each chromosome into a chart, or karyogram, also known as an ideogram ([link]). in a given species, chromosomes can be identified by their number, size, centromere position, and banding pattern. in a human karyotype, autosomes or body chromosomes (all of the nonsex chromosomes) are generally organized in approximate order of size from largest (chromosome 1) to smallest (chromosome 22). the x and y chromosomes are not autosomes. however, chromosome 21 is actually shorter than chromosome 22. this was discovered after the naming of down syndrome as trisomy 21, reflecting how this disease results from possessing one extra chromosome 21 (three total). not wanting to change the name of this important disease, chromosome 21 retained its numbering, despite describing the shortest set of chromosomes. the chromosome arms projecting from either end of the centromere may be designated as short or long, depending on their relative lengths. the short arm is abbreviated p (for petite), whereas the long arm is abbreviated q (because it follows p alphabetically). each arm is further subdivided and denoted by a number. using this naming system, locations on chromosomes can be described consistently in the scientific literature. geneticists use karyograms to identify chromosomal aberrationsalthough mendel is referred to as the father of modern genetics, he performed his experiments with none of the tools that the geneticists of today routinely employ. one such powerful cytological technique is karyotyping, a method in which traits characterized by chromosomal abnormalities can be identified from a single cell. to observe an individuals karyotype, a persons cells (like white blood cells) are first collected from a blood sample or other tissue. in the laboratory, the isolated cells are stimulated to begin actively dividing. a chemical called colchicine is then applied to cells to arrest condensed chromosomes in metaphase. cells are then made to swell using a hypotonic solution so the chromosomes spread apart. finally, the sample is preserved in a fixative and applied to a slide. the geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize the distinct and reproducible banding patterns of each chromosome pair. following staining, the chromosomes are viewed using bright-field microscopy. a common stain choice is the giemsa stain. giemsa staining results in approximately 400800 bands (of tightly coiled dna and condensed proteins) arranged along all of the 23 chromosome pairs; an experienced geneticist can identify each band. in addition to the banding patterns, chromosomes are further identified on the basis of size and centromere location. to obtain the classic depiction of the karyotype in which homologous pairs of chromosomes are aligned in numerical order from longest to shortest, the geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies each chromosome, and manually arranges the chromosomes into this pattern ([link]). at its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many or too few chromosomes per cell. examples of this are down syndrome, which is identified by a third copy of chromosome 21, and turner syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of only one x chromosome in women instead of the normal two. geneticists can also identify large deletions or insertions of dna. for instance, jacobsen syndromewhich involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding defectsis identified by a deletion on chromosome 11. finally, the karyotype can pinpoint translocations, which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome. translocations are implicated in certain cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia. during mendels lifetime, inheritance was an abstract concept that could only be inferred by performing crosses and observing the traits expressed by offspring. by observing a karyogram, todays geneticists can actually visualize the chromosomal composition of an individual to confirm or predict genetic abnormalities in offspring, even before birth. of all of the chromosomal disorders, abnormalities in chromosome number are the most obviously identifiable from a karyogram. disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes, as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes. they are caused by nondisjunction, which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis. misaligned or incomplete synapsis, or a dysfunction of the spindle apparatus that facilitates chromosome migration, can cause nondisjunction. the risk of nondisjunction occurring increases with the age of the parents. nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis i or ii, with differing results ([link]). if homologous chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis i, the result is two gametes that lack that particular chromosome and two gametes with two copies of the chromosome. if sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis ii, the result is one gamete that lacks that chromosome, two normal gametes with one copy of the chromosome, and one gamete with two copies of the chromosome. an individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species is called euploid; in humans, euploidy corresponds to 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. an individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid, a term that includes monosomy (loss of one chromosome) or trisomy (gain of an extraneous chromosome). monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they lack essential genes. this underscores the importance of gene dosage in humans. most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop to birth; however, duplications of some of the smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring that survive for several weeks to many years. trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose. individuals with an extra chromosome may synthesize an abundance of the gene products encoded by that chromosome. this extra dose (150 percent)  of specific genes can lead to a number of functional challenges and often precludes development. the most common trisomy among viable births is that of chromosome 21, which corresponds to down syndrome. individuals with this inherited disorder are characterized by short stature and stunted digits, facial distinctions that include a broad skull and large tongue, and significant developmental delays. the incidence of down syndrome is correlated with maternal age; older women are more likely to become pregnant with fetuses carrying the trisomy 21 genotype ([link]). an individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called polyploid. for instance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. polyploid animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. polyploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally and instead produces mostly aneuploid daughter cells that cannot yield viable zygotes. rarely, polyploid animals can reproduce asexually by haplodiploidy, in which an unfertilized egg divides mitotically to produce offspring. in contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species ([link]). humans display dramatic deleterious effects with autosomal trisomies and monosomies. therefore, it may seem counterintuitive that human females and males can function normally, despite carrying different numbers of the x chromosome. rather than a gain or loss of autosomes, variations in the number of sex chromosomes are associated with relatively mild effects. in part, this occurs because of a molecular process called x inactivation. early in development, when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells (relative to trillions in the newborn), one x chromosome in each cell inactivates by tightly condensing into a quiescent (dormant) structure called a barr body. the chance that an x chromosome (maternally or paternally derived) is inactivated in each cell is random, but once the inactivation occurs, all cells derived from that one will have the same inactive x chromosome or barr body. by this process, females compensate for their double genetic dose of x chromosome. in so-called tortoiseshell cats, embryonic x inactivation is observed as color variegation ([link]). females that are heterozygous for an x-linked coat color gene will express one of two different coat colors over different regions of their body, corresponding to whichever x chromosome is inactivated in the embryonic cell progenitor of that region. an individual carrying an abnormal number of x chromosomes will inactivate all but one x chromosome in each of her cells. however, even inactivated x chromosomes continue to express a few genes, and x chromosomes must reactivate for the proper maturation of female ovaries. as a result, x-chromosomal abnormalities are typically associated with mild mental and physical defects, as well as sterility. if the x chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop in utero. several errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized. individuals with three x chromosomes, called triplo-x, are phenotypically female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. the xxy genotype, corresponding to one type of klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to phenotypically male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and reduced body hair. more complex types of klinefelter syndrome exist in which the individual has as many as five x chromosomes. in all types, every x chromosome except one undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic dosage. this can be seen as several barr bodies in each cell nucleus. turner syndrome, characterized as an x0 genotype (i.e., only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a phenotypically female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility. in addition to the loss or gain of an entire chromosome, a chromosomal segment may be duplicated or lost. duplications and deletions often produce offspring that survive but exhibit physical and mental abnormalities. duplicated chromosomal segments may fuse to existing chromosomes or may be free in the nucleus. cri-du-chat (from the french for cry of the cat) is a syndrome associated with nervous system abnormalities and identifiable physical features that result from a deletion of most of 5p (the small arm of chromosome 5) ([link]). infants with this genotype emit a characteristic high-pitched cry on which the disorders name is based. cytologists have characterized numerous structural rearrangements in chromosomes, but chromosome inversions and translocations are the most common. both are identified during meiosis by the adaptive pairing of rearranged chromosomes with their former homologs to maintain appropriate gene alignment. if the genes carried on two homologs are not oriented correctly, a recombination event could result in the loss of genes from one chromosome and the gain of genes on the other. this would produce aneuploid gametes. a chromosome inversion is the detachment, 180 rotation, and reinsertion of part of a chromosome. inversions may occur in nature as a result of mechanical shear, or from the action of transposable elements (special dna sequences capable of facilitating the rearrangement of chromosome segments with the help of enzymes that cut and paste dna sequences). unless they disrupt a gene sequence, inversions only change the orientation of genes and are likely to have more mild effects than aneuploid errors. however, altered gene orientation can result in functional changes because regulators of gene expression could be moved out of position with respect to their targets, causing aberrant levels of gene products. an inversion can be pericentric and include the centromere, or paracentric and occur outside of the centromere ([link]). a pericentric inversion that is asymmetric about the centromere can change the relative lengths of the chromosome arms, making these inversions easily identifiable. when one homologous chromosome undergoes an inversion but the other does not, the individual is described as an inversion heterozygote. to maintain point-for-point synapsis during meiosis, one homolog must form a loop, and the other homolog must mold around it. although this topology can ensure that the genes are correctly aligned, it also forces the homologs to stretch and can be associated with regions of imprecise synapsis ([link]). the chromosome 18 inversionnot all structural rearrangements of chromosomes produce nonviable, impaired, or infertile individuals. in rare instances, such a change can result in the evolution of a new species. in fact, a pericentric inversion in chromosome 18 appears to have contributed to the evolution of humans. this inversion is not present in our closest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees. humans and chimpanzees differ cytogenetically by pericentric inversions on several chromosomes and by the fusion of two separate chromosomes in chimpanzees that correspond to chromosome two in humans. the pericentric chromosome 18 inversion is believed to have occurred in early humans following their divergence from a common ancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago. researchers characterizing this inversion have suggested that approximately 19,000 nucleotide bases were duplicated on 18p, and the duplicated region inverted and reinserted on chromosome 18 of an ancestral human. a comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two genesrock1 and usp14that are adjacent on chimpanzee chromosome 17 (which corresponds to human chromosome 18) are more distantly positioned on human chromosome 18. this suggests that one of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes. interestingly, humans and chimpanzees express usp14 at distinct levels in specific cell types, including cortical cells and fibroblasts. perhaps the chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression levels in a useful way. because both rock1 and usp14 encode cellular enzymes, a change in their expression could alter cellular function. it is not known how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution, but it appears to be a significant factor in the divergence of humans from other primates.1 a translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome. translocations can be benign or have devastating effects depending on how the positions of genes are altered with respect to regulatory sequences. notably, specific translocations have been associated with several cancers and with schizophrenia. reciprocal translocations result from the exchange of chromosome segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes such that there is no gain or loss of genetic information ([link]). the number, size, shape, and banding pattern of chromosomes make them easily identifiable in a karyogram and allows for the assessment of many chromosomal abnormalities. disorders in chromosome number, or aneuploidies, are typically lethal to the embryo, although a few trisomic genotypes are viable. because of x inactivation, aberrations in sex chromosomes typically have milder phenotypic effects. aneuploidies also include instances in which segments of a chromosome are duplicated or deleted. chromosome structures may also be rearranged, for example by inversion or translocation. both of these aberrations can result in problematic phenotypic effects. because they force chromosomes to assume unnatural topologies during meiosis, inversions and translocations are often associated with reduced fertility because of the likelihood of nondisjunction. violaine goidts et al., segmental duplication associated with the human-specific inversion of chromosome 18: a further example of the impact of segmental duplications on karyotype and

65,stax-bio,14,DNA Structure and Function,1,m44485,Historical Basis of Modern Understanding,"modern understandings of dna have evolved from the discovery of nucleic acid to the development of the double-helix model. in the 1860s, friedrich miescher ([link]), a physician by profession, was the first person to isolate phosphate-rich chemicals from white blood cells or leukocytes. he named these chemicals (which would eventually be known as rna and dna) nuclein because they were isolated from the nuclei of the cells. a half century later, british bacteriologist frederick griffith was perhaps the first person to show that hereditary information could be transferred from one cell to another horizontally, rather than by descent. in 1928, he reported the first demonstration of bacterial transformation, a process in which external dna is taken up by a cell, thereby changing morphology and physiology. he was working with streptococcus pneumoniae, the bacterium that causes pneumonia. griffith worked with two strains, rough (r) and smooth (s). the r strain is non-pathogenic (does not cause disease) and is called rough because its outer surface is a cell wall and lacks a capsule; as a result, the cell surface appears uneven under the microscope. the s strain is pathogenic (disease-causing) and has a capsule outside its cell wall. as a result, it has a smooth appearance under the microscope. griffith injected the live r strain into mice and they survived. in another experiment, when he injected mice with the heat-killed s strain, they also survived. in a third set of experiments, a mixture of live r strain and heat-killed s strain were injected into mice, andto his surprisethe mice died. upon isolating the live bacteria from the dead mouse, only the s strain of bacteria was recovered. when this isolated s strain was injected into fresh mice, the mice died. griffith concluded that something had passed from the heat-killed s strain into the live r strain and transformed it into the pathogenic s strain, and he called this the transforming principle ([link]). these experiments are now famously known as griffith's transformation experiments. scientists oswald avery, colin macleod, and maclyn mccarty (1944) were interested in exploring this transforming principle further. they isolated the s strain from the dead mice and isolated the proteins and nucleic acids, namely rna and dna, as these were possible candidates for the molecule of heredity. they conducted a systematic elimination study. they used enzymes that specifically degraded each component and then used each mixture separately to transform the r strain. they found that when dna was degraded, the resulting mixture was no longer able to transform the bacteria, whereas all of the other combinations were able to transform the bacteria. this led them to conclude that dna was the transforming principle. forensic scientists and dna analysisdna evidence was used for the first time to solve an immigration case. the story started with a teenage boy returning to london from ghana to be with his mother. immigration authorities at the airport were suspicious of him, thinking that he was traveling on a forged passport. after much persuasion, he was allowed to go live with his mother, but the immigration authorities did not drop the case against him. all types of evidence, including photographs, were provided to the authorities, but deportation proceedings were started nevertheless. around the same time, dr. alec jeffreys of leicester university in the united kingdom had invented a technique known as dna fingerprinting. the immigration authorities approached dr. jeffreys for help. he took dna samples from the mother and three of her children, plus an unrelated mother, and compared the samples with the boys dna. because the biological father was not in the picture, dna from the three children was compared with the boys dna. he found a match in the boys dna for both the mother and his three siblings. he concluded that the boy was indeed the mothers son. forensic scientists analyze many items, including documents, handwriting, firearms, and biological samples. they analyze the dna content of hair, semen, saliva, and blood, and compare it with a database of dna profiles of known criminals. analysis includes dna isolation, sequencing, and sequence analysis; most forensic dna analysis involves polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of short tandem repeat (str) loci and electrophoresis to determine the length of the pcr-amplified fragment. only mitochondrial dna is sequenced for forensics. forensic scientists are expected to appear at court hearings to present their findings. they are usually employed in crime labs of city and state government agencies. geneticists experimenting with dna techniques also work for scientific and research organizations, pharmaceutical industries, and college and university labs. students wishing to pursue a career as a forensic scientist should have at least a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biology, or physics, and preferably some experience working in a laboratory. experiments conducted by martha chase and alfred hershey in 1952 provided confirmatory evidence that dna was the genetic material and not proteins. chase and hershey were studying a bacteriophage, which is a virus that infects bacteria. viruses typically have a simple structure: a protein coat, called the capsid, and a nucleic acid core that contains the genetic material, either dna or rna. the bacteriophage infects the host bacterial cell by attaching to its surface, and then it injects its nucleic acids inside the cell. the phage dna makes multiple copies of itself using the host machinery, and eventually the host cell bursts, releasing a large number of bacteriophages. hershey and chase labeled one batch of phage with radioactive sulfur, 35s, to label the protein coat. another batch of phage were labeled with radioactive phosphorus, 32p. because phosphorous is found in dna, but not protein, the dna and not the protein would be tagged with radioactive phosphorus. each batch of phage was allowed to infect the cells separately. after infection, the phage bacterial suspension was put in a blender, which caused the phage coat to be detached from the host cell. the phage and bacterial suspension was spun down in a centrifuge. the heavier bacterial cells settled down and formed a pellet, whereas the lighter phage particles stayed in the supernatant. in the tube that contained phage labeled with 35s, the supernatant contained the radioactively labeled phage, whereas no radioactivity was detected in the pellet. in the tube that contained the phage labeled with 32p, the radioactivity was detected in the pellet that contained the heavier bacterial cells, and no radioactivity was detected in the supernatant.  hershey and chase concluded that it was the phage dna that was injected
into the cell and carried information to produce more phage particles, thus providing evidence that dna was the genetic material and not proteins ([link]). around this same time, austrian biochemist erwin chargaff examined the content of dna in different species and found that the amounts of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine were not found in equal quantities, and that it varied from species to species, but not between individuals of the same species. he found that the amount of adenine equals the amount of thymine, and the amount of cytosine equals the amount of guanine, or a = t and g = c. this is also known as chargaffs rules. this finding proved immensely useful when watson and crick were getting ready to propose their dna double helix model. dna was first isolated from white blood cells by friedrich miescher, who called it nuclein because it was isolated from nuclei. frederick griffith's experiments with strains of streptococcus pneumoniae provided the first hint that dna may be the transforming principle. avery, macleod, and mccarty proved that dna is required for the transformation of bacteria. later experiments by hershey and chase using bacteriophage t2 proved that dna is the genetic material. chargaff found that the ratio of a = t and c = g, and that the percentage content of a, t, g, and c is different for different species.","[('dna structure', 'dna structures'), ('phage', 'phages'), ('dna transformation', 'dna transformations'), ('dna analysi', 'dna analyses', 'dna analysis'), (""chargaff' rule"", ""chargaff' ruless"", ""chargaff' rules""), ('deoxyribonucleic acid', 'deoxyribonucleic acids'), ('friedrich miescher', 'friedrich mieschers'), ('dna', 'dnas'), ('transformation', 'transformations'), ('dna function', 'dna functions')]"
66,stax-bio,14,DNA Structure and Function,2,m44486,DNA Structure and Sequencing,"the building blocks of dna are nucleotides. the important components of the nucleotide are a nitrogenous base, deoxyribose (5-carbon sugar), and a phosphate group ([link]). the nucleotide is named depending on the nitrogenous base. the nitrogenous base can be a purine such as adenine (a) and guanine (g), or a pyrimidine such as cytosine (c) and thymine (t). the nucleotides combine with each other by covalent bonds known as phosphodiester bonds or linkages. the purines have a double ring structure with a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. pyrimidines are smaller in size; they have a single six-membered ring structure. the carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5' (1' is read as one prime). the phosphate residue is attached to the hydroxyl group of the 5' carbon of one sugar of one nucleotide and the hydroxyl group of the 3' carbon of the sugar of the next nucleotide, thereby forming a 5'-3' phosphodiester bond. in the 1950s, francis crick and james watson worked together to determine the structure of dna at the university of cambridge, england. other scientists like linus pauling and maurice wilkins were also actively exploring this field. pauling had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using x-ray crystallography. in wilkins lab, researcher rosalind franklin was using x-ray diffraction methods to understand the structure of dna. watson and crick were able to piece together the puzzle of the dna molecule on the basis of franklin's data because crick had also studied x-ray diffraction ([link]). in 1962, james watson, francis crick, and maurice wilkins were awarded the nobel prize in medicine. unfortunately, by then franklin had died, and nobel prizes are not awarded posthumously. watson and crick proposed that dna is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix. base pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine; namely, a pairs with t and g pairs with c. adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. the base pairs are stabilized by hydrogen bonds; adenine and thymine form two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. the two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, the 3' end of one strand faces the 5' end of the other strand. the sugar and phosphate of the nucleotides form the backbone of the structure, whereas the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. each base pair is separated from the other base pair by a distance of 0.34 nm, and each turn of the helix measures 3.4 nm. therefore, ten base pairs are present per turn of the helix. the diameter of the dna double helix is 2 nm, and it is uniform throughout. only the pairing between a purine and pyrimidine can explain the uniform diameter. the twisting of the two strands around each other results in the formation of uniformly spaced major and minor grooves ([link]). until the 1990s, the sequencing of dna (reading the sequence of dna) was a relatively expensive and long process. using radiolabeled nucleotides also compounded the problem through safety concerns. with currently available technology and automated machines, the process is cheap, safer, and can be completed in a matter of hours. fred sanger developed the sequencing method used for the human genome sequencing project, which is widely used today ([link]). the method is known as the dideoxy chain termination method. the sequencing method is based on the use of chain terminators, the dideoxynucleotides (ddntps). the dideoxynucleotides, or ddntpss, differ from the deoxynucleotides by the lack of a free 3' oh group on the five-carbon sugar. if a ddntp is added to a growing a dna strand, the chain is not extended any further because the free 3' oh group needed to add another nucleotide is not available. by using a predetermined ratio of deoxyribonucleotides to dideoxynucleotides, it is possible to generate dna fragments of different sizes. the dna sample to be sequenced is denatured or separated into two strands by heating it to high temperatures. the dna is divided into four tubes in which a primer, dna polymerase, and all four nucleotides (a, t, g, and c) are added. in addition to each of the four tubes, limited quantities of one of the four dideoxynucleotides are added to each tube respectively. the tubes are labeled as a, t, g, and c according to the ddntp added. for detection purposes, each of the four dideoxynucleotides carries a different fluorescent label. chain elongation continues until a fluorescent dideoxy nucleotide is incorporated, after which no further elongation takes place. after the reaction is over, electrophoresis is performed. even a difference in length of a single base can be detected. the sequence is read from a laser scanner. for his work on dna sequencing, sanger received a nobel prize in chemistry in 1980. gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate dna fragments of different sizes. usually the gel is made of a chemical called agarose. agarose powder is added to a buffer and heated. after cooling, the gel solution is poured into a casting tray. once the gel has solidified, the dna is loaded on the gel and electric current is applied. the dna has a net negative charge and moves from the negative electrode toward the positive electrode. the electric current is applied for sufficient time to let the dna separate according to size; the smallest fragments will be farthest from the well (where the dna was loaded), and the heavier molecular weight fragments will be closest to the well. once the dna is separated, the gel is stained with a dna-specific dye for viewing it ([link]). neanderthal genome: how are we related?the first draft sequence of the neanderthal genome was recently published by richard e. green et al. in 2010.1 neanderthals are the closest ancestors of present-day humans. they were known to have lived in europe and western asia before they disappeared from fossil records approximately 30,000 years ago. greens team studied almost 40,000-year-old fossil remains that were selected from sites across the world. extremely sophisticated means of sample preparation and dna sequencing were employed because of the fragile nature of the bones and heavy microbial contamination. in their study, the scientists were able to sequence some four billion base pairs. the neanderthal sequence was compared with that of present-day humans from across the world. after comparing the sequences, the researchers found that the neanderthal genome had 2 to 3 percent greater similarity to people living outside africa than to people in africa. while current theories have suggested that all present-day humans can be traced to a small ancestral population in africa, the data from the neanderthal genome may contradict this view. green and his colleagues also discovered dna segments among people in europe and asia that are more similar to neanderthal sequences than to other contemporary human sequences. another interesting observation was that neanderthals are as closely related to people from papua new guinea as to those from china or france. this is surprising because neanderthal fossil remains have been located only in europe and west asia. most likely, genetic exchange took place between neanderthals and modern humans as modern humans emerged out of africa, before the divergence of europeans, east asians, and papua new guineans. several genes seem to have undergone changes from neanderthals during the evolution of present-day humans. these genes are involved in cranial structure, metabolism, skin morphology, and cognitive development. one of the genes that is of particular interest is runx2, which is different in modern day humans and neanderthals. this gene is responsible for the prominent frontal bone, bell-shaped rib cage, and dental differences seen in neanderthals. it is speculated that an evolutionary change in runx2 was important in the origin of modern-day humans, and this affected the cranium and the upper body. when comparing prokaryotic cells to eukaryotic cells, prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features ([link]). most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome that is found in an area of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. the size of the genome in one of the most well-studied prokaryotes, e.coli, is 4.6 million base pairs (approximately 1.1 mm, if cut and stretched out). so how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? the dna is twisted by what is known as supercoiling. supercoiling means that dna is either under-wound (less than one turn of the helix per 10 base pairs) or over-wound (more than 1 turn per 10 base pairs) from its normal relaxed state. some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes such as dna gyrase help in maintaining the supercoiled structure. eukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear dna molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their dna inside the nucleus ([link]). at the most basic level, dna is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. the histones are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are rich in basic amino acids and form an octamer. the dna (which is negatively charged because of the phosphate groups) is wrapped tightly around the histone core. this nucleosome is linked to the next one with the help of a linker dna. this is also known as the beads on a string structure. this is further compacted into a 30 nm fiber, which is the diameter of the structure. at the metaphase stage, the chromosomes are at their most compact, are approximately 700 nm in width, and are found in association with scaffold proteins. in interphase, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. the tightly packaged region is known as heterochromatin, and the less dense region is known as euchromatin. heterochromatin usually contains genes that are not expressed, and is found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. the euchromatin usually contains genes that are transcribed, with dna packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted. the currently accepted model of the double-helix structure of dna was proposed by watson and crick. some of the salient features are that the two strands that make up the double helix are complementary and anti-parallel in nature. deoxyribose sugars and phosphates form the backbone of the structure, and the nitrogenous bases are stacked inside. the diameter of the double helix, 2 nm, is uniform throughout. a purine always pairs with a pyrimidine; a pairs with t, and g pairs with c. one turn of the helix has ten base pairs. during cell division, each daughter cell receives a copy of the dna by a process known as dna replication. prokaryotes are much simpler than eukaryotes in many of their features. most prokaryotes contain a single, circular chromosome. in general, eukaryotic chromosomes contain a linear dna molecule packaged into nucleosomes, and have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining, reflecting different states of packaging and compaction. richard e. green et al., a draft sequence of the neandertal genome, science 328 (2010): 710-22.","[('sanger method', 'sanger methods'), ('james watson', 'james watsons'), ('dna structure', 'dna structures'), ('electrophoresi', 'electrophoreses', 'electrophoresis'), ('eukaryotic dna', 'eukaryotic dnas'), ('genome', 'genomes'), ('franci crick', 'franci cricks'), ('deoxyribonucleic acid', 'deoxyribonucleic acids'), ('prokaryotic dna', 'prokaryotic dnas'), ('dna', 'dnas'), ('maclyn mccarty', 'maclyn mccarties'), ('dna sequencing', 'dna sequencings'), ('dna function', 'dna functions')]"
67,stax-bio,14,DNA Structure and Function,3,m44487,Basics of DNA Replication,"the elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how dna divides and makes copies of itself. this model suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. what was not clear was how the replication took place. there were three models suggested ([link]): conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive. in conservative replication, the parental dna remains together, and the newly formed daughter strands are together. the semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental dna strands act as a template for new dna to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded dna includes one parental or old strand and one new strand. in the dispersive model, both copies of dna have double-stranded segments of parental dna and newly synthesized dna interspersed. meselson and stahl were interested in understanding how dna replicates. they grew e. coli for several generations in a medium containing a heavy isotope of nitrogen (15n) that gets incorporated into nitrogenous bases, and eventually into the dna ([link]). the e. coli culture was then shifted into medium containing 14n and allowed to grow for one generation. the cells were harvested and the dna was isolated. the dna was centrifuged at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. some cells were allowed to grow for one more life cycle in 14n and spun again. during the density gradient centrifugation, the dna is loaded into a gradient (typically a salt such as cesium chloride or sucrose) and spun at high speeds of 50,000 to 60,000 rpm. under these circumstances, the dna will form a band according to its density in the gradient. dna grown in 15n will band at a higher density position than that grown in 14n. meselson and stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14n after they had been shifted from 15n, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between dna of cells grown exclusively in 15n and 14n. this suggested either a semi-conservative or dispersive mode of replication. the dna harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14n formed two bands: one dna band was at the intermediate position between 15n and 14n, and the other corresponded to the band of 14n dna. these results could only be explained if dna replicates in a semi-conservative manner. therefore, the other two modes were ruled out. during dna replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. the new strand will be complementary to the parental or old strand. when two daughter dna copies are formed, they have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells. the model for dna replication suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. in conservative replication, the parental dna is conserved, and the daughter dna is newly synthesized. the semi-conservative method suggests that each of the two parental dna strands acts as template for new dna to be synthesized; after replication, each double-stranded dna includes one parental or old strand and one new strand. the dispersive mode suggested that the two copies of the dna would have segments of parental dna and newly synthesized dna.","[('dna structure', 'dna structures'), ('dna replication', 'dna replications'), ('stahl', 'stahls'), ('deoxyribonucleic acid', 'deoxyribonucleic acids'), ('dna', 'dnas'), ('meselson', 'meselsons'), ('dna function', 'dna functions')]"
68,stax-bio,14,DNA Structure and Function,4,m44488,DNA Replication in Prokaryotes,"dna replication has been extremely well studied in prokaryotes primarily because of the small size of the genome and the mutants that are available. e. coli has 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome and all of it gets replicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the circle in both directions. this means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. the process is quite rapid and occurs without many mistakes. dna replication employs a large number of proteins and enzymes, each of which plays a critical role during the process. one of the key players is the enzyme dna polymerase, also known as dna pol, which adds nucleotides one by one to the growing dna chain that are complementary to the template strand. the addition of nucleotides requires energy; this energy is obtained from the nucleotides that have three phosphates attached to them, similar to atp which has three phosphate groups attached. when the bond between the phosphates is broken, the energy released is used to form the phosphodiester bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain. in prokaryotes, three main types of polymerases are known: dna pol i, dna pol ii, and dna pol iii. it is now known that dna pol iii is the enzyme required for dna synthesis; dna pol i and dna pol ii are primarily required for repair. how does the replication machinery know where to begin? it turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication where replication begins. in e. coli, which has a single origin of replication on its one chromosome (as do most prokaryotes), it is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in at sequences. the origin of replication is recognized by certain proteins that bind to this site. an enzyme called helicase unwinds the dna by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs. atp hydrolysis is required for this process. as the dna opens up, y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed. two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication and these get extended bi- directionally as replication proceeds. single-strand binding proteins coat the single strands of dna near the replication fork to prevent the single-stranded dna from winding back into a double helix. dna polymerase is able to add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction (a new dna strand can be only extended in this direction). it also requires a free 3'-oh group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a phosphodiester bond between the 3'-oh end and the 5' phosphate of the next nucleotide. this essentially means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3'-oh group is not available. then how does it add the first nucleotide? the problem is solved with the help of a primer that provides the free 3'-oh end. another enzyme, rna primase, synthesizes an rna primer that is about five to ten nucleotides long and complementary to the dna. because this sequence primes the dna synthesis, it is appropriately called the primer. dna polymerase can now extend this rna primer, adding nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand ([link]). the replication fork moves at the rate of 1000 nucleotides per second. dna polymerase can only extend in the 5' to 3' direction, which poses a slight problem at the replication fork. as we know, the dna double helix is anti-parallel; that is, one strand is in the 5' to 3' direction and the other is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction. one strand, which is complementary to the 3' to 5' parental dna strand, is synthesized continuously towards the replication fork because the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction. this continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand. the other strand, complementary to the 5' to 3' parental dna, is extended away from the replication fork, in small fragments known as okazaki fragments, each requiring a primer to start the synthesis. okazaki fragments are named after the japanese scientist who first discovered them. the strand with the okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand. the leading strand can be extended by one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short okazaki fragments. the overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3' to 5', and that of the leading strand 5' to 3'. a protein called the sliding clamp holds the dna polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. the sliding clamp is a ring-shaped protein that binds to the dna and holds the polymerase in place. topoisomerase prevents the over-winding of the dna double helix ahead of the replication fork as the dna is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the dna helix and then resealing it. as synthesis proceeds, the rna primers are replaced by dna. the primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of dna pol i, and the gaps are filled in by deoxyribonucleotides. the nicks that remain between the newly synthesized dna (that replaced the rna primer) and the previously synthesized dna are sealed by the enzyme dna ligase that catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester linkage between the 3'-oh end of one nucleotide and the 5' phosphate end of the other fragment. once the chromosome has been completely replicated, the two dna copies move into two different cells during cell division. the process of dna replication can be summarized as follows:  dna unwinds at the origin of replication. helicase opens up the dna-forming replication forks; these are extended bidirectionally. single-strand binding proteins coat the dna around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the dna. topoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling. primase synthesizes rna primers complementary to the dna strand. dna polymerase starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-oh end of the primer. elongation of both the lagging and the leading strand continues. rna primers are removed by exonuclease activity. gaps are filled by dna pol by adding dntps. the gap between the two dna fragments is sealed by dna ligase, which helps in the formation of phosphodiester bonds.  replication in prokaryotes starts from a sequence found on the chromosome called the origin of replicationthe point at which the dna opens up. helicase opens up the dna double helix, resulting in the formation of the replication fork. single-strand binding proteins bind to the single-stranded dna near the replication fork to keep the fork open. primase synthesizes an rna primer to initiate synthesis by dna polymerase, which can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. one strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of the replication fork; this is called the leading strand. the other strand is synthesized in a direction away from the replication fork, in short stretches of dna known as okazaki fragments. this strand is known as the lagging strand. once replication is completed, the rna primers are replaced by dna nucleotides and the dna is sealed with dna ligase, which creates phosphodiester bonds between the 3'-oh of one end and the 5' phosphate of the other strand.","[('leading strand', 'leading strands'), ('primase', 'primases'), ('dna structure', 'dna structures'), ('topoisomerase', 'topoisomerases'), ('primer', 'primers'), ('single-strand binding protein', 'single-strand binding proteins'), ('prokaryotic dna', 'prokaryotic dnas'), ('dna replication', 'dna replications'), ('lagging strand', 'lagging strands'), ('ligase', 'ligases'), ('deoxyribonucleic acid', 'deoxyribonucleic acids'), ('replication fork', 'replication forks'), ('enzyme function', 'enzyme functions'), ('okazaki fragment', 'okazaki fragments'), ('dna', 'dnas'), ('helicase', 'helicases'), ('sliding clamp', 'sliding clamps'), ('dna function', 'dna functions')]"
69,stax-bio,14,DNA Structure and Function,5,m44517,DNA Replication in Eukaryotes,"eukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger in size than prokaryotic genomes. the human genome has three billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are replicated during the s phase of the cell cycle. there are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome; humans can have up to 100,000 origins of replication. the rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second, much slower than prokaryotic replication. in yeast, which is a eukaryote, special sequences known as autonomously replicating sequences (ars) are found on the chromosomes. these are equivalent to the origin of replication in e. coli. the number of dna polymerases in eukaryotes is much more than prokaryotes: 14 are known, of which five are known to have major roles during replication and have been well studied. they are known as pol , pol , pol , pol , and pol . the essential steps of replication are the same as in prokaryotes. before replication can start, the dna has to be made available as template. eukaryotic dna is bound to basic proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. the chromatin (the complex between dna and proteins) may undergo some chemical modifications, so that the dna may be able to slide off the proteins or be accessible to the enzymes of the dna replication machinery. at the origin of replication, a pre-replication complex is made with other initiator proteins. other proteins are then recruited to start the replication process ([link]).  a helicase using the energy from atp hydrolysis opens up the dna helix. replication forks are formed at each replication origin as the dna unwinds. the opening of the double helix causes over-winding, or supercoiling, in the dna ahead of the replication fork. these are resolved with the action of topoisomerases. primers are formed by the enzyme primase, and using the primer, dna pol can start synthesis. while the leading strand is continuously synthesized by the enzyme pol , the lagging strand is synthesized by pol . a sliding clamp protein known as pcna (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) holds the dna pol in place so that it does not slide off the dna. rnase h removes the rna primer, which is then replaced with dna nucleotides. the okazaki fragments in the lagging strand are joined together after the replacement of the rna primers with dna. the gaps that remain are sealed by dna ligase, which forms the phosphodiester bond. unlike prokaryotic chromosomes, eukaryotic chromosomes are linear. as youve learned, the enzyme dna pol can add nucleotides only in the 5' to 3' direction. in the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached. on the lagging strand, dna is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. when the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place for a primer to be made for the dna fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. these ends thus remain unpaired, and over time these ends may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide. the ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that code for no particular gene. in a way, these telomeres protect the genes from getting deleted as cells continue to divide. in humans, a six base pair sequence, ttaggg, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. the discovery of the enzyme telomerase ([link]) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. the telomerase enzyme contains a catalytic part and a built-in rna template. it attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the rna template are added on the 3' end of the dna strand. once the 3' end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, dna polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated. telomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells. it is not active in adult somatic cells. for her discovery of telomerase and its action, elizabeth blackburn ([link]) received the nobel prize for medicine and physiology in 2009. cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened because most somatic cells do not make telomerase. this essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. with the advent of modern medicine, preventative health care, and healthier lifestyles, the human life span has increased, and there is an increasing demand for people to look younger and have a better quality of life as they grow older. in 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice. this may have potential in regenerative medicine.1 telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem cell depletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses. telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension of telomeres, reduced dna damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved the function of the testes, spleen, and intestines. thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans. cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell division of abnormal cells. the cells accumulate mutations, proliferate uncontrollably, and can migrate to different parts of the body through a process called metastasis. scientists have observed that cancerous cells have considerably shortened telomeres and that telomerase is active in these cells. interestingly, only after the telomeres were shortened in the cancer cells did the telomerase become active. if the action of telomerase in these cells can be inhibited by drugs during cancer therapy, then the cancerous cells could potentially be stopped from further division. replication in eukaryotes starts at multiple origins of replication. the mechanism is quite similar to prokaryotes. a primer is required to initiate synthesis, which is then extended by dna polymerase as it adds nucleotides one by one to the growing chain. the leading strand is synthesized continuously, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized in short stretches called okazaki fragments. the rna primers are replaced with dna nucleotides; the dna remains one continuous strand by linking the dna fragments with dna ligase. the ends of the chromosomes pose a problem as polymerase is unable to extend them without a primer. telomerase, an enzyme with an inbuilt rna template, extends the ends by copying the rna template and extending one end of the chromosome. dna polymerase can then extend the dna using the primer. in this way, the ends of the chromosomes are protected.","[('telomerase', 'telomerases'), ('dna structure', 'dna structures'), ('elizabeth blackburn', 'elizabeth blackburns'), ('dna replication', 'dna replications'), ('eukaryotic dna', 'eukaryotic dnas'), ('deoxyribonucleic acid', 'deoxyribonucleic acids'), ('telomere replication', 'telomere replications'), ('dna', 'dnas'), ('telomere', 'telomeres'), ('dna function', 'dna functions')]"
70,stax-bio,14,DNA Structure and Function,6,m44513,DNA Repair,"dna replication is a highly accurate process, but mistakes can occasionally occur, such as a dna polymerase inserting a wrong base. uncorrected mistakes may sometimes lead to serious consequences, such as cancer. repair mechanisms correct the mistakes. in rare cases, mistakes are not corrected, leading to mutations; in other cases, repair enzymes are themselves mutated or defective. most of the mistakes during dna replication are promptly corrected by dna polymerase by proofreading the base that has been just added ([link]). in proofreading, the dna pol reads the newly added base before adding the next one, so a correction can be made. the polymerase checks whether the newly added base has paired correctly with the base in the template strand. if it is the right base, the next nucleotide is added. if an incorrect base has been added, the enzyme makes a cut at the phosphodiester bond and releases the wrong nucleotide. this is performed by the exonuclease action of dna pol iii. once the incorrect nucleotide has been removed, a new one will be added again. some errors are not corrected during replication, but are instead corrected after replication is completed; this type of repair is known as mismatch repair ([link]). the enzymes recognize the incorrectly added nucleotide and excise it; this is then replaced by the correct base. if this remains uncorrected, it may lead to more permanent damage. how do mismatch repair enzymes recognize which of the two bases is the incorrect one? in e. coli, after replication, the nitrogenous base adenine acquires a methyl group; the parental dna strand will have methyl groups, whereas the newly synthesized strand lacks them. thus, dna polymerase is able to remove the wrongly incorporated bases from the newly synthesized, non-methylated strand. in eukaryotes, the mechanism is not very well understood, but it is believed to involve recognition of unsealed nicks in the new strand, as well as a short-term continuing association of some of the replication proteins with the new daughter strand after replication has completed. in another type of repair mechanism, nucleotide excision repair, enzymes replace incorrect bases by making a cut on both the 3' and 5' ends of the incorrect base ([link]). the segment of dna is removed and replaced with the correctly paired nucleotides by the action of dna pol. once the bases are filled in, the remaining gap is sealed with a phosphodiester linkage catalyzed by dna ligase. this repair mechanism is often employed when uv exposure causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers. a well-studied example of mistakes not being corrected is seen in people suffering from xeroderma pigmentosa ([link]). affected individuals have skin that is highly sensitive to uv rays from the sun. when individuals are exposed to uv, pyrimidine dimers, especially those of thymine, are formed; people with xeroderma pigmentosa are not able to repair the damage. these are not repaired because of a defect in the nucleotide excision repair enzymes, whereas in normal individuals, the thymine dimers are excised and the defect is corrected. the thymine dimers distort the structure of the dna double helix, and this may cause problems during dna replication. people with xeroderma pigmentosa may have a higher risk of contracting skin cancer than those who dont have the condition. errors during dna replication are not the only reason why mutations arise in dna. mutations, variations in the nucleotide sequence of a genome, can also occur because of damage to dna. such mutations may be of two types: induced or spontaneous. induced mutations are those that result from an exposure to chemicals, uv rays, x-rays, or some other environmental agent. spontaneous mutations occur without any exposure to any environmental agent; they are a result of natural reactions taking place within the body. mutations may have a wide range of effects. some mutations are not expressed; these are known as silent mutations. point mutations are those mutations that affect a single base pair. the most common nucleotide mutations are substitutions, in which one base is replaced by another. these can be of two types, either transitions or transversions. transition substitution refers to a purine or pyrimidine being replaced by a base of the same kind; for example, a purine such as adenine may be replaced by the purine guanine. transversion substitution refers to a purine being replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice versa; for example, cytosine, a pyrimidine, is replaced by adenine, a purine. mutations can also be the result of the addition of a base, known as an insertion, or the removal of a base, also known as deletion. sometimes a piece of dna from one chromosome may get translocated to another chromosome or to another region of the same chromosome; this is also known as translocation. these mutation types are shown in [link]. mutations in repair genes have been known to cause cancer. many mutated repair genes have been implicated in certain forms of pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and colorectal cancer. mutations can affect either somatic cells or germ cells. if many mutations accumulate in a somatic cell, they may lead to problems such as the uncontrolled cell division observed in cancer. if a mutation takes place in germ cells, the mutation will be passed on to the next generation, as in the case of hemophilia and xeroderma pigmentosa. dna polymerase can make mistakes while adding nucleotides. it edits the dna by proofreading every newly added base. incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the correct base, and then a new base is added. most mistakes are corrected during replication, although when this does not happen, the mismatch repair mechanism is employed. mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from the dna, replacing it with the correct base. in yet another type of repair, nucleotide excision repair, the incorrect base is removed along with a few bases on the 5' and 3' end, and these are replaced by copying the template with the help of dna polymerase. the ends of the newly synthesized fragment are attached to the rest of the dna using dna ligase, which creates a phosphodiester bond. most mistakes are corrected, and if they are not, they may result in a mutation defined as a permanent change in the dna sequence. mutations can be of many types, such as substitution, deletion, insertion, and translocation. mutations in repair genes may lead to serious consequences such as cancer. mutations can be induced or may occur spontaneously.","[('nucleotide excision repair', 'nucleotide excision repairs', 'nucleotide excisions repair', 'nucleotide excisions repairs'), ('proofreading', 'proofreadings'), ('dna structure', 'dna structures'), ('silent mutation', 'silent mutations'), ('spontaneous mutation', 'spontaneous mutations'), ('transversion substitution', 'transversion substitutions'), ('induced mutation', 'induced mutations'), ('point mutation', 'point mutations'), ('dna repair', 'dna repairs'), ('deoxyribonucleic acid', 'deoxyribonucleic acids'), ('mismatch repair', 'mismatch repairs'), ('dna', 'dnas'), ('transition substitution', 'transition substitutions'), ('mutation', 'mutations'), ('dna function', 'dna functions')]"

72,stax-bio,15,Genes and Proteins,1,m44522,The Genetic Code,"the cellular process of transcription generates messenger rna (mrna), a mobile molecular copy of one or more genes with an alphabet of a, c, g, and uracil (u). translation of the mrna template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. protein sequences consist of 20 commonly occurring amino acids; therefore, it can be said that the protein alphabet consists of 20 letters ([link]). each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the triplet codon. different amino acids have different chemistries (such as acidic versus basic, or polar and nonpolar) and different structural constraints. variation in amino acid sequence gives rise to enormous variation in protein structure and function. the flow of genetic information in cells from dna to mrna to protein is described by the central dogma ([link]), which states that genes specify the sequence of mrnas, which in turn specify the sequence of proteins. the decoding of one molecule to another is performed by specific proteins and rnas. because the information stored in dna is so central to cellular function, it makes intuitive sense that the cell would make mrna copies of this information for protein synthesis, while keeping the dna itself intact and protected. the copying of dna to rna is relatively straightforward, with one nucleotide being added to the mrna strand for every nucleotide read in the dna strand. the translation to protein is a bit more complex because three mrna nucleotides correspond to one amino acid in the polypeptide sequence. however, the translation to protein is still systematic and colinear, such that nucleotides 1 to 3 correspond to amino acid 1, nucleotides 4 to 6 correspond to amino acid 2, and so on. given the different numbers of letters in the mrna and protein alphabets, scientists theorized that combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids. nucleotide doublets would not be sufficient to specify every amino acid because there are only 16 possible two-nucleotide combinations (42). in contrast, there are 64 possible nucleotide triplets (43), which is far more than the number of amino acids. scientists theorized that amino acids were encoded by nucleotide triplets and that the genetic code was degenerate. in other words, a given amino acid could be encoded by more than one nucleotide triplet. this was later confirmed experimentally; francis crick and sydney brenner used the chemical mutagen proflavin to insert one, two, or three nucleotides into the gene of a virus. when one or two nucleotides were inserted, protein synthesis was completely abolished. when three nucleotides were inserted, the protein was synthesized and functional. this demonstrated that three nucleotides specify each amino acid. these nucleotide triplets are called codons. the insertion of one or two nucleotides completely changed the triplet reading frame, thereby altering the message for every subsequent amino acid ([link]). though insertion of three nucleotides caused an extra amino acid to be inserted during translation, the integrity of the rest of the protein was maintained. scientists painstakingly solved the genetic code by translating synthetic mrnas in vitro and sequencing the proteins they specified ([link]). in addition to instructing the addition of a specific amino acid to a polypeptide chain, three of the 64 codons terminate protein synthesis and release the polypeptide from the translation machinery. these triplets are called nonsense codons, or stop codons. another codon, aug, also has a special function. in addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the start codon to initiate translation. the reading frame for translation is set by the aug start codon near the 5' end of the mrna. the genetic code is universal. with a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis. conservation of codons means that a purified mrna encoding the globin protein in horses could be transferred to a tulip cell, and the tulip would synthesize horse globin. that there is only one genetic code is powerful evidence that all of life on earth shares a common origin, especially considering that there are about 1084 possible combinations of 20 amino acids and 64 triplet codons. degeneracy is believed to be a cellular mechanism to reduce the negative impact of random mutations. codons that specify the same amino acid typically only differ by one nucleotide. in addition, amino acids with chemically similar side chains are encoded by similar codons. this nuance of the genetic code ensures that a single-nucleotide substitution mutation might either specify the same amino acid but have no effect or specify a similar amino acid, preventing the protein from being rendered completely nonfunctional. which has more dna: a kiwi or a strawberry? question: would a kiwifruit and strawberry that are approximately the same size ([link]) also have approximately the same amount of dna? background: genes are carried on chromosomes and are made of dna. all mammals are diploid, meaning they have two copies of each chromosome. however, not all plants are diploid. the common strawberry is octoploid (8n) and the cultivated kiwi is hexaploid (6n). research the total number of chromosomes in the cells of each of these fruits and think about how this might correspond to the amount of dna in these fruits cell nuclei. read about the technique of dna isolation to understand how each step in the isolation protocol helps liberate and precipitate dna. hypothesis: hypothesize whether you would be able to detect a difference in dna quantity from similarly sized strawberries and kiwis. which fruit do you think would yield more dna? test your hypothesis: isolate the dna from a strawberry and a kiwi that are similarly sized. perform the experiment in at least triplicate for each fruit. prepare a bottle of dna extraction buffer from 900 ml water, 50 ml dish detergent, and two teaspoons of table salt. mix by inversion (cap it and turn it upside down a few times). grind a strawberry and a kiwifruit by hand in a plastic bag, or using a mortar and pestle, or with a metal bowl and the end of a blunt instrument. grind for at least two minutes per fruit. add 10 ml of the dna extraction buffer to each fruit, and mix well for at least one minute. remove cellular debris by filtering each fruit mixture through cheesecloth or porous cloth and into a funnel placed in a test tube or an appropriate container. pour ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) into the test tube. you should observe white, precipitated dna. gather the dna from each fruit by winding it around separate glass rods. 
record your observations: because you are not quantitatively measuring dna volume, you can record for each trial whether the two fruits produced the same or different amounts of dna as observed by eye. if one or the other fruit produced noticeably more dna, record this as well. determine whether your observations are consistent with several pieces of each fruit. analyze your data: did you notice an obvious difference in the amount of dna produced by each fruit? were your results reproducible? draw a conclusion: given what you know about the number of chromosomes in each fruit, can you conclude that chromosome number necessarily correlates to dna amount? can you identify any drawbacks to this procedure? if you had access to a laboratory, how could you standardize your comparison and make it more quantitative? the genetic code refers to the dna alphabet (a, t, c, g), the rna alphabet (a, u, c, g), and the polypeptide alphabet (20 amino acids). the central dogma describes the flow of genetic information in the cell from genes to mrna to proteins. genes are used to make mrna by the process of transcription; mrna is used to synthesize proteins by the process of translation. the genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mrna specify only 20 amino acids and three nonsense codons. almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.","[('codon', 'codons'), ('nonsense codon', 'nonsense codons'), ('protein', 'proteins'), ('gene', 'geness', 'genes'), ('gene', 'genes'), ('protein', 'proteinss', 'proteins'), ('genetic code', 'genetic codes'), ('reading frame', 'reading frames'), ('central dogma', 'central dogmata'), ('colinear', 'colinears'), ('degeneracy', 'degeneracies')]"
73,stax-bio,15,Genes and Proteins,2,m44523,Prokaryotic Transcription,"the prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, are mostly single-celled organisms that, by definition, lack membrane-bound nuclei and other organelles. a bacterial chromosome is a covalently
closed circle that, unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, is not organized around histone proteins. the central region of the cell in which prokaryotic dna resides is called the nucleoid. in addition, prokaryotes often have abundant plasmids, which are shorter circular dna molecules that may only contain one or a few genes. plasmids can be transferred independently of the bacterial chromosome during cell division and often carry traits such as antibiotic resistance. transcription in prokaryotes (and in eukaryotes) requires the dna double helix to partially unwind in the region of mrna synthesis. the region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble. transcription always proceeds from the same dna strand for each gene, which is called the template strand. the mrna product is complementary to the template strand and is almost identical to the other dna strand, called the nontemplate strand. the only difference is that in mrna, all of the t nucleotides are replaced with u nucleotides. in an rna double helix, a can bind u via two hydrogen bonds, just as in at pairing in a dna double helix. the nucleotide pair in the dna double helix that corresponds to the site from which the first 5' mrna nucleotide is transcribed is called the +1 site, or the initiation site. nucleotides preceding the initiation site are given negative numbers and are designated upstream. conversely, nucleotides following the initiation site are denoted with + numbering and are called downstream nucleotides. prokaryotes do not have membrane-enclosed nuclei. therefore, the processes of transcription, translation, and mrna degradation can all occur simultaneously. the intracellular level of a bacterial protein can quickly be amplified by multiple transcription and translation events occurring concurrently on the same dna template. prokaryotic transcription often covers more than one gene and produces polycistronic mrnas that specify more than one protein. our discussion here will exemplify transcription by describing this process in escherichia coli, a well-studied bacterial species. although some differences exist between transcription in e. coli and transcription in archaea, an understanding of e. coli transcription can be applied to virtually all bacterial species. prokaryotes use the same rna polymerase to transcribe all of their genes. in e. coli, the polymerase is composed of five polypeptide subunits, two of which are identical. four of these subunits, denoted , , , and ' comprise the polymerase core enzyme. these subunits assemble every time a gene is transcribed, and they disassemble once transcription is complete. each subunit has a unique role; the two -subunits are necessary to assemble the polymerase on the dna; the -subunit binds to the ribonucleoside triphosphate that will become part of the nascent recently born mrna molecule; and the ' binds the dna template strand. the fifth subunit, , is involved only in transcription initiation. it confers transcriptional specificity such that the polymerase begins to synthesize mrna from an appropriate initiation site. without , the core enzyme would transcribe from random sites and would produce mrna molecules that specified protein gibberish. the polymerase comprised of all five subunits is called the holoenzyme. a promoter is a dna sequence onto which the transcription machinery binds and initiates transcription. in most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. the specific sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently. although promoters vary among prokaryotic genomes, a few elements are conserved. at the -10 and -35 regions upstream of the initiation site, there are two promoter consensus sequences, or regions that are similar across all promoters and across various bacterial species ([link]). the -10 consensus sequence, called the -10 region, is tataat. the -35 sequence, ttgaca, is recognized and bound by . once this interaction is made, the subunits of the core enzyme bind to the site. the at-rich -10 region facilitates unwinding of the dna template, and several phosphodiester bonds are made. the transcription initiation phase ends with the production of abortive transcripts, which are polymers of approximately 10 nucleotides that are made and released. the transcription elongation phase begins with the release of the  subunit from the polymerase. the dissociation of  allows the core enzyme to proceed along the dna template, synthesizing mrna in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of approximately 40 nucleotides per second. as elongation proceeds, the dna is continuously unwound ahead of the core enzyme and rewound behind it ([link]). the base pairing between dna and rna is not stable enough to maintain the stability of the mrna synthesis components. instead, the rna polymerase acts as a stable linker between the dna template and the nascent rna strands to ensure that elongation is not interrupted prematurely. once a gene is transcribed, the prokaryotic polymerase needs to be instructed to dissociate from the dna template and liberate the newly made mrna. depending on the gene being transcribed, there are two kinds of termination signals. one is protein-based and the other is rna-based. rho-dependent termination is controlled by the rho protein, which tracks along behind the polymerase on the growing mrna chain. near the end of the gene, the polymerase encounters a run of g nucleotides on the dna template and it stalls. as a result, the rho protein collides with the polymerase. the interaction with rho releases the mrna from the transcription bubble. rho-independent termination is controlled by specific sequences in the dna template strand. as the polymerase nears the end of the gene being transcribed, it encounters a region rich in cg nucleotides. the mrna folds back on itself, and the complementary cg nucleotides bind together. the result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall as soon as it begins to transcribe a region rich in at nucleotides. the complementary ua region of the mrna transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template dna. this, coupled with the stalled polymerase, induces enough instability for the core enzyme to break away and liberate the new mrna transcript. upon termination, the process of transcription is complete. by the time termination occurs, the prokaryotic transcript would already have been used to begin synthesis of numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur concurrently. the unification of transcription, translation, and even mrna degradation is possible because all of these processes occur in the same 5' to 3' direction, and because there is no membranous compartmentalization in the prokaryotic cell ([link]). in contrast, the presence of a nucleus in eukaryotic cells precludes simultaneous transcription and translation. in prokaryotes, mrna synthesis is initiated at a promoter sequence on the dna template comprising two consensus sequences that recruit rna polymerase. the prokaryotic polymerase consists of a core enzyme of four protein subunits and a  protein that assists only with initiation. elongation synthesizes mrna in the 5' to 3' direction at a rate of 40 nucleotides per second. termination liberates the mrna and occurs either by rho protein interaction or by the formation of an mrna hairpin.","[('protein',

74,stax-bio,15,Genes and Proteins,3,m44524,Eukaryotic Transcription,"prokaryotes and eukaryotes perform fundamentally the same process of transcription, with a few key differences. the most important difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is the latters membrane-bound nucleus and organelles. with the genes bound in a nucleus, the eukaryotic cell must be able to transport its mrna to the cytoplasm and must protect its mrna from degrading before it is translated. eukaryotes also employ three different polymerases that each transcribe a different subset of genes. eukaryotic mrnas are usually monogenic, meaning that they specify a single protein. unlike the prokaryotic polymerase that can bind to a dna template on its own, eukaryotes require several other proteins, called transcription factors, to first bind to the promoter region and then help recruit the appropriate polymerase. the features of eukaryotic mrna synthesis are markedly more complex those of prokaryotes. instead of a single polymerase comprising five subunits, the eukaryotes have three polymerases that are each made up of 10 subunits or more. each eukaryotic polymerase also requires a distinct set of transcription factors to bring it to the dna template. rna polymerase i is located in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure in which ribosomal rna (rrna) is transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes ([link]). the rrna molecules are considered structural rnas because they have a cellular role but are not translated into protein. the rrnas are components of the ribosome and are essential to the process of translation. rna polymerase i synthesizes all of the rrnas except for the 5s rrna molecule. the s designation applies to svedberg units, a nonadditive value that characterizes the speed at which a particle sediments during centrifugation. rna polymerase ii is located in the nucleus and synthesizes all protein-coding nuclear pre-mrnas. eukaryotic pre-mrnas undergo extensive processing after transcription but before translation. for clarity, this modules discussion of transcription and translation in eukaryotes will use the term mrnas to describe only the mature, processed molecules that are ready to be translated. rna polymerase ii is responsible for transcribing the overwhelming majority of eukaryotic genes. rna polymerase iii is also located in the nucleus. this polymerase transcribes a variety of structural rnas that includes the 5s pre-rrna, transfer pre-rnas (pre-trnas), and small nuclear pre-rnas. the trnas have a critical role in translation; they serve as the adaptor molecules between the mrna template and the growing polypeptide chain. small nuclear rnas have a variety of functions, including splicing pre-mrnas and regulating transcription factors. a scientist characterizing a new gene can determine which polymerase transcribes it by testing whether the gene is expressed in the presence of a particular mushroom poison, -amanitin ([link]). interestingly, -amanitin produced by amanita phalloides, the death cap mushroom, affects the three polymerases very differently. rna polymerase i is completely insensitive to -amanitin, meaning that the polymerase can transcribe dna in vitro in the presence of this poison. in contrast, rna polymerase ii is extremely sensitive to -amanitin, and rna polymerase iii is moderately sensitive. knowing the transcribing polymerase can clue a researcher into the general function of the gene being studied. because rna polymerase ii transcribes the vast majority of genes, we will focus on this polymerase in our subsequent discussions about eukaryotic transcription factors and promoters. eukaryotic promoters are much larger and more complex than prokaryotic promoters, but both have a tata box. for example, in the mouse thymidine kinase gene, the tata box is located at approximately -30 relative to the initiation (+1) site ([link]). for this gene, the exact tata box sequence is tataaaa, as read in the 5' to 3' direction on the nontemplate strand. this sequence is not identical to the e. coli tata box, but it conserves the at rich element. the thermostability of at bonds is low and this helps the dna template to locally unwind in preparation for transcription. the mouse genome includes one gene and two pseudogenes for cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. pseudogenes are genes that have lost their protein-coding ability or are no longer expressed by the cell. these pseudogenes are copied from mrna and incorporated into the chromosome. for example, the mouse thymidine kinase promoter also has a conserved caat box (ggccaatct) at approximately -80. this sequence is essential and is involved in binding transcription factors. further upstream of the tata box, eukaryotic promoters may also contain one or more gc-rich boxes (ggcg) or octamer boxes (atttgcat). these elements bind cellular factors that increase the efficiency of transcription initiation and are often identified in more active genes that are constantly being expressed by the cell. the complexity of eukaryotic transcription does not end with the polymerases and promoters. an army of basal transcription factors, enhancers, and silencers also help to regulate the frequency with which pre-mrna is synthesized from a gene. enhancers and silencers affect the efficiency of transcription but are not necessary for transcription to proceed. basal transcription factors are crucial in the formation of a preinitiation complex on the dna template that subsequently recruits rna polymerase ii for transcription initiation. the names of the basal transcription factors begin with tfii (this is the transcription factor for rna polymerase ii) and are specified with the letters aj. the transcription factors systematically fall into place on the dna template, with each one further stabilizing the preinitiation complex and contributing to the recruitment of rna polymerase ii. the processes of bringing rna polymerases i and iii to the dna template involve slightly less complex collections of transcription factors, but the general theme is the same. eukaryotic transcription is a tightly regulated process that requires a variety of proteins to interact with each other and with the dna strand. although the process of transcription in eukaryotes involves a greater metabolic investment than in prokaryotes, it ensures that the cell transcribes precisely the pre-mrnas that it needs for protein synthesis. the evolution of promotersthe evolution of genes may be a familiar concept. mutations can occur in genes during dna replication, and the result may or may not be beneficial to the cell. by altering an enzyme, structural protein, or some other factor, the process of mutation can transform functions or physical features. however, eukaryotic promoters and other gene regulatory sequences may evolve as well. for instance, consider a gene that, over many generations, becomes more valuable to the cell. maybe the gene encodes a structural protein that the cell needs to synthesize in abundance for a certain function. if this is the case, it would be beneficial to the cell for that genes promoter to recruit transcription factors more efficiently and increase gene expression. scientists examining the evolution of promoter sequences have reported varying results. in part, this is because it is difficult to infer exactly where a eukaryotic promoter begins and ends. some promoters occur within genes; others are located very far upstream, or even downstream, of the genes they are regulating. however, when researchers limited their examination to human core promoter sequences that were defined experimentally as sequences that bind the preinitiation complex, they found that promoters evolve even faster than protein-coding genes. it is still unclear how promoter evolution might correspond to the evolution of humans or other higher organisms. however, the evolution of a promoter to effectively make more or less of a given gene product is an intriguing alternative to the evolution of the genes themselves.1
 in eukaryotes, the conserved promoter elements differ for genes transcribed by rna polymerases i, ii, and iii. rna polymerase i transcribes genes that have two gc-rich promoter sequences in the -45 to +20 region. these sequences alone are sufficient for transcription initiation to occur, but promoters with additional sequences in the region from -180 to -105 upstream of the initiation site will further enhance initiation. genes that are transcribed by rna polymerase iii have upstream promoters or promoters that occur within the genes themselves. following the formation of the preinitiation complex, the polymerase is released from the other transcription factors, and elongation is allowed to proceed as it does in prokaryotes with the polymerase synthesizing pre-mrna in the 5' to 3' direction. as discussed previously, rna polymerase ii transcribes the major share of eukaryotic genes, so this section will focus on how this polymerase accomplishes elongation and termination. although the enzymatic process of elongation is essentially the same in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, the dna template is more complex. when eukaryotic cells are not dividing, their genes exist as a diffuse mass of dna and proteins called chromatin. the dna is tightly packaged around charged histone proteins at repeated intervals. these dnahistone complexes, collectively called nucleosomes, are regularly spaced and include 146 nucleotides of dna wound around eight histones like thread around a spool. for polynucleotide synthesis to occur, the transcription machinery needs to move histones out of the way every time it encounters a nucleosome. this is accomplished by a special protein complex called fact, which stands for facilitates chromatin transcription. this complex pulls histones away from the dna template as the polymerase moves along it. once the pre-mrna is synthesized, the fact complex replaces the histones to recreate the nucleosomes. the termination of transcription is different for the different polymerases. unlike in prokaryotes, elongation by rna polymerase ii in eukaryotes takes place 1,0002,000 nucleotides beyond the end of the gene being transcribed. this pre-mrna tail is subsequently removed by cleavage during mrna processing. on the other hand, rna polymerases i and iii require termination signals. genes transcribed by rna polymerase i contain a specific 18-nucleotide sequence that is recognized by a termination protein. the process of termination in rna polymerase iii involves an mrna hairpin similar to rho-independent termination of transcription in prokaryotes. transcription in eukaryotes involves one of three types of polymerases, depending on the gene being transcribed. rna polymerase ii transcribes all of the protein-coding genes, whereas rna polymerase i transcribes rrna genes, and rna polymerase iii transcribes rrna, trna, and small nuclear rna genes. the initiation of transcription in eukaryotes involves the binding of several transcription factors to complex promoter sequences that are usually located upstream of the gene being copied. the mrna is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, and the fact complex moves and reassembles nucleosomes as the polymerase passes by. whereas rna polymerases i and iii terminate transcription by protein- or rna hairpin-dependent methods, rna polymerase ii transcribes for 1,000 or more nucleotides beyond the gene template and cleaves the excess during pre-mrna processing.","[('small nuclear rna', 'small nuclear rnas'), ('fact', 'facts'), ('preinitiation complex', 'preinitiation complexes'), ('caat box', 'caat boxes'), ('protein', 'proteins'), ('gc-rich box', 'gc-rich boxes'), ('gene', 'geness', 'genes'), ('gene', 'genes'), ('protein', 'proteinss', 'proteins'), ('octamer box', 'octamer boxes'), ('eukaryotic transcription', 'eukaryotic transcriptions')]"
75,stax-bio,15,Genes and Proteins,4,m44532,RNA Processing in Eukaryotes,"after transcription, eukaryotic pre-mrnas must undergo several processing steps before they can be translated. eukaryotic (and prokaryotic) trnas and rrnas also undergo processing before they can function as components in the protein synthesis machinery. the eukaryotic pre-mrna undergoes extensive processing before it is ready to be translated. the additional steps involved in eukaryotic mrna maturation create a molecule with a much longer half-life than a prokaryotic mrna. eukaryotic mrnas last for several hours, whereas the typical e. coli mrna lasts no more than five seconds. pre-mrnas are first coated in rna-stabilizing proteins; these protect the pre-mrna from degradation while it is processed and exported out of the nucleus. the three most important steps of pre-mrna processing are the addition of stabilizing and signaling factors at the 5' and 3' ends of the molecule, and the removal of intervening sequences that do not specify the appropriate amino acids. in rare cases, the mrna transcript can be edited after it is transcribed. rna editing in trypanosomesthe trypanosomes are a group of protozoa that include the pathogen trypanosoma brucei, which causes sleeping sickness in humans ([link]). trypanosomes, and virtually all other eukaryotes, have organelles called mitochondria that supply the cell with chemical energy. mitochondria are organelles that express their own dna and are believed to be the remnants of a symbiotic relationship between a eukaryote and an engulfed prokaryote.  the mitochondrial dna of trypanosomes exhibit an interesting exception to the central dogma: their pre-mrnas do not have the correct information to specify a functional protein. usually, this is because the mrna is missing several u nucleotides. the cell performs an additional rna processing step called rna editing to remedy this. other genes in the mitochondrial genome encode 40- to 80-nucleotide guide rnas. one or more of these molecules interacts by complementary base pairing with some of the nucleotides in the pre-mrna transcript. however, the guide rna has more a nucleotides than the pre-mrna has u nucleotides to bind with. in these regions, the guide rna loops out. the 3' ends of guide rnas have a long poly-u tail, and these u bases are inserted in regions of the pre-mrna transcript at which the guide rnas are looped. this process is entirely mediated by rna molecules. that is, guide rnasrather than proteinsserve as the catalysts in rna editing. rna editing is not just a phenomenon of trypanosomes. in the mitochondria of some plants, almost all pre-mrnas are edited. rna editing has also been identified in mammals such as rats, rabbits, and even humans. what could be the evolutionary reason for this additional step in pre-mrna processing? one possibility is that the mitochondria, being remnants of ancient prokaryotes, have an equally ancient rna-based method for regulating gene expression. in support of this hypothesis, edits made to pre-mrnas differ depending on cellular conditions. although speculative, the process of rna editing may be a holdover from a primordial time when rna molecules, instead of proteins, were responsible for catalyzing reactions. while the pre-mrna is still being synthesized, a 7-methylguanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the growing transcript by a phosphate linkage. this moiety (functional group) protects the nascent mrna from degradation. in addition, factors involved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes. once elongation is complete, the pre-mrna is cleaved by an endonuclease between an aauaaa consensus sequence and a gu-rich sequence, leaving the aauaaa sequence on the pre-mrna. an enzyme called poly-a polymerase then adds a string of approximately 200 a residues, called the poly-a tail. this modification further protects the pre-mrna from degradation and signals the export of the cellular factors that the transcript needs to the cytoplasm. eukaryotic genes are composed of exons, which correspond to protein-coding sequences (ex-on signifies that they are expressed), and intervening sequences called introns (int-ron denotes their intervening role), which may be involved in gene regulation but are removed from the pre-mrna during processing. intron sequences in mrna do not encode functional proteins. the discovery of introns came as a surprise to researchers in the 1970s who expected that pre-mrnas would specify protein sequences without further processing, as they had observed in prokaryotes. the genes of higher eukaryotes very often contain one or more introns. these regions may correspond to regulatory sequences; however, the biological significance of having many introns or having very long introns in a gene is unclear. it is possible that introns slow down gene expression because it takes longer to transcribe pre-mrnas with lots of introns. alternatively, introns may be nonfunctional sequence remnants left over from the fusion of ancient genes throughout evolution. this is supported by the fact that separate exons often encode separate protein subunits or domains. for the most part, the sequences of introns can be mutated without ultimately affecting the protein product. all of a pre-mrnas introns must be completely and precisely removed before protein synthesis. if the process errs by even a single nucleotide, the reading frame of the rejoined exons would shift, and the resulting protein would be dysfunctional. the process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing ([link]). introns are removed and degraded while the pre-mrna is still in the nucleus. splicing occurs by a sequence-specific mechanism that ensures introns will be removed and exons rejoined with the accuracy and precision of a single nucleotide. the splicing of pre-mrnas is conducted by complexes of proteins and rna molecules called spliceosomes. note that more than 70 individual introns can be present, and each has to undergo the process of splicingin addition to 5' capping and the addition of a poly-a tailjust to generate a single, translatable mrna molecule. the trnas and rrnas are structural molecules that have roles in protein synthesis; however, these rnas are not themselves translated. pre-rrnas are transcribed, processed, and assembled into ribosomes in the nucleolus. pre-trnas are transcribed and processed in the nucleus and then released into the cytoplasm where they are linked to free amino acids for protein synthesis. most of the trnas and rrnas in eukaryotes and prokaryotes are first transcribed as a long precursor molecule that spans multiple rrnas or trnas. enzymes then cleave the precursors into subunits corresponding to each structural rna. some of the bases of pre-rrnas are methylated; that is, a ch3 moiety (methyl functional group) is added for stability. pre-trna molecules also undergo methylation. as with pre-mrnas, subunit excision occurs in eukaryotic pre-rnas destined to become trnas or rrnas. mature rrnas make up approximately 50 percent of each ribosome. some of a ribosomes rna molecules are purely structural, whereas others have catalytic or binding activities. mature trnas take on a three-dimensional structure through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to position the amino acid binding site at one end and the anticodon at the other end ([link]). the anticodon is a three-nucleotide sequence in a trna that interacts with an mrna codon through complementary base pairing. eukaryotic pre-mrnas are modified with a 5' methylguanosine cap and a poly-a tail. these structures protect the mature mrna from degradation and help export it from the nucleus. pre-mrnas also undergo splicing, in which introns are removed and exons are reconnected with single-nucleotide accuracy. only finished mrnas that have undergone 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and intron splicing are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. pre-rrnas and pre-trnas may be processed by intramolecular cleavage, splicing, methylation, and chemical conversion of nucleotides. rarely, rna editing is also performed to insert missing bases after an mrna has been synthesized.","[('rna processing', 'rna processings'), ('poly-a tail', 'poly-a tails'), ('intron', 'introns'), ('protein', 'proteinss', 'proteins'), ('protein', 'proteins'), ('splicing', 'splicings'), ('gene', 'geness', 'genes'), ('gene', 'genes'), ('rna editing', 'rna editings'), ('exon', 'exons'), ('anticodon', 'anticodons'), ('7-methylguanosine cap', '7-methylguanosine caps')]"
76,stax-bio,15,Genes and Proteins,5,m44529,Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis,"the synthesis of proteins consumes more of a cells energy than any other metabolic process. in turn, proteins account for more mass than any other component of living organisms (with the exception of water), and proteins perform virtually every function of a cell. the process of translation, or protein synthesis, involves the decoding of an mrna message into a polypeptide product. amino acids are covalently strung together by interlinking peptide bonds in lengths ranging from approximately 50 amino acid residues to more than 1,000. each individual amino acid has an amino group (nh2) and a carboxyl (cooh) group. polypeptides are formed when the amino group of one amino acid forms an amide (i.e., peptide) bond with the carboxyl group of another amino acid ([link]). this reaction is catalyzed by ribosomes and generates one water molecule. in addition to the mrna template, many molecules and macromolecules contribute to the process of translation. the composition of each component may vary across species; for instance, ribosomes may consist of different numbers of rrnas and polypeptides depending on the organism. however, the general structures and functions of the protein synthesis machinery are comparable from bacteria to human cells. translation requires the input of an mrna template, ribosomes, trnas, and various enzymatic factors. even before an mrna is translated, a cell must invest energy to build each of its ribosomes. in e. coli, there are  between 10,000 and 70,000  ribosomes present in each cell at any given time. a ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rrnas, and many distinct polypeptides. in eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rrnas. ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and rough endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. mitochondria and chloroplasts also have their own ribosomes in the matrix and stroma, which look more similar to prokaryotic ribosomes (and have similar drug sensitivities) than the ribosomes just outside their outer membranes in the cytoplasm.  ribosomes dissociate into large and small subunits when they are not synthesizing proteins and reassociate during the initiation of translation. in e. coli, the small subunit is described as 30s, and the large subunit is 50s, for a total of 70s (recall that svedberg units are not additive). mammalian ribosomes have a small 40s subunit and a large 60s subunit, for a total of 80s. the small subunit is responsible for binding the mrna template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds trnas. each mrna molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction: reading the mrna from 5' to 3' and synthesizing the polypeptide from the n terminus to the c terminus. the complete mrna/poly-ribosome structure is called a polysome. the trnas are structural rna molecules that were transcribed from genes by rna polymerase iii. depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of trnas exist in the cytoplasm. serving as adaptors, specific trnas bind to sequences on the mrna template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. therefore, trnas are the molecules that actually translate the language of rna into the language of proteins. of the 64 possible mrna codonsor triplet combinations of a, u, g, and cthree specify the termination of protein synthesis and 61 specify the addition of amino acids to the polypeptide chain. of these 61, one codon (aug) also encodes the initiation of translation. each trna anticodon can base pair with one of the mrna codons and add an amino acid or terminate translation, according to the genetic code. for instance, if the sequence cua occurred on an mrna template in the proper reading frame, it would bind a trna expressing the complementary sequence, gau, which would be linked to the amino acid leucine. as the adaptor molecules of translation, it is surprising that trnas can fit so much specificity into such a small package. consider that trnas need to interact with three factors:  1) they must be recognized by the correct aminoacyl synthetase (see below); 2) they must be recognized by ribosomes; and 3) they must bind to the correct sequence in mrna. the process of pre-trna synthesis by rna polymerase iii only creates the rna portion of the adaptor molecule. the corresponding amino acid must be added later, once the trna is processed and exported to the cytoplasm. through the process of trna charging, each trna molecule is linked to its correct amino acid by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl trna synthetases. at least one type of aminoacyl trna synthetase exists for each of the 20 amino acids; the exact number of aminoacyl trna synthetases varies by species. these enzymes first bind and hydrolyze atp to catalyze a high-energy bond between an amino acid and adenosine monophosphate (amp); a pyrophosphate molecule is expelled in this reaction. the activated amino acid is then transferred to the trna, and amp is released. as with mrna synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. the process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. here well explore how translation occurs in e. coli, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation. protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. in e. coli, this complex involves the small 30s ribosome, the mrna template, three initiation factors (ifs; if-1, if-2, and if-3), and a special initiator trna, called

 at the beginning of every polypeptide chain synthesized by e. coli, but it is usually clipped off after translation is complete. when an in-frame aug is encountered during translation elongation, a non-formylated methionine is inserted by a regular met-trnamet. in e. coli mrna, a sequence upstream of the first aug codon, called the shine-dalgarno sequence (aggagg), interacts with the rrna molecules that compose the ribosome. this interaction anchors the 30s ribosomal subunit at the correct location on the mrna template. guanosine triphosphate (gtp), which is a purine nucleotide triphosphate, acts as an energy source during translationboth at the start of elongation and during the ribosomes translocation. in eukaryotes, a similar initiation complex forms, comprising mrna, the 40s small ribosomal subunit, ifs, and nucleoside triphosphates (gtp and atp). the charged initiator trna, called met-trnai, does not bind fmet in eukaryotes, but is distinct from other met-trnas in that it can bind ifs. instead of depositing at the shine-dalgarno sequence, the eukaryotic initiation complex recognizes the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5' end of the mrna. a cap-binding protein (cbp) and several other ifs assist the movement of the ribosome to the 5' cap. once at the cap, the initiation complex tracks along the mrna in the 5' to 3' direction, searching for the aug start codon. many eukaryotic mrnas are translated from the first aug, but this is not always the case. according to kozaks rules, the nucleotides around the aug indicate whether it is the correct start codon. kozaks rules state that the following consensus sequence must appear around the aug of vertebrate genes: 5'-gccrccaugg-3'. the r (for purine) indicates a site that can be either a or g, but cannot be c or u. essentially, the closer the sequence is to this consensus, the higher the efficiency of translation. once the appropriate aug is identified, the other proteins and cbp dissociate, and the 60s subunit binds to the complex of met-trnai, mrna, and the 40s subunit. this step completes the initiation of translation in eukaryotes. in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective of e. coli. the 50s ribosomal subunit of e. coli consists of three compartments: the a (aminoacyl) site binds incoming charged aminoacyl trnas. the p (peptidyl) site binds charged trnas carrying amino acids that have formed peptide bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding trna. the e (exit) site releases dissociated trnas so that they can be recharged with free amino acids. there is one exception to this assembly line of trnas: in e. coli,

 is capable of entering the p site directly without first entering the a site. similarly, the eukaryotic met-trnai, with help from other proteins of the initiation complex, binds directly to the p site. in both cases, this creates an initiation complex with a free a site ready to accept the trna corresponding to the first codon after the aug. during translation elongation, the mrna template provides specificity. as the ribosome moves along the mrna, each mrna codon comes into register, and specific binding with the corresponding charged trna anticodon is ensured. if mrna were not present in the elongation complex, the ribosome would bind trnas nonspecifically. elongation proceeds with charged trnas entering the a site and then shifting to the p site followed by the e site with each single-codon step of the ribosome. ribosomal steps are induced by conformational changes that advance the ribosome by three bases in the 3' direction. the energy for each step of the ribosome is donated by an elongation factor that hydrolyzes gtp. peptide bonds form between the amino group of the amino acid attached to the a-site trna and the carboxyl group of the amino acid attached to the p-site trna. the formation of each peptide bond is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an rna-based enzyme that is integrated into the 50s ribosomal subunit. the energy for each peptide bond formation is derived from gtp hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by a separate elongation factor. the amino acid bound to the p-site trna is also linked to the growing polypeptide chain. as the ribosome steps across the mrna, the former p-site trna enters the e site, detaches from the amino acid, and is expelled ([link]). amazingly, the e. coli translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid protein can be translated in just 10 seconds. termination of translation occurs when a nonsense codon (uaa, uag, or uga) is encountered. upon aligning with the a site, these nonsense codons are recognized by release factors in prokaryotes and eukaryotes that instruct peptidyl transferase to add a water molecule to the carboxyl end of the p-site amino acid. this reaction forces the p-site amino acid to detach from its trna, and the newly made protein is released. the small and large ribosomal subunits dissociate from the mrna and from each other; they are recruited almost immediately into another translation initiation complex. after many ribosomes have completed translation, the mrna is degraded so the nucleotides can be reused in another transcription reaction. during and after translation, individual amino acids may be chemically modified, signal sequences may be appended, and the new protein folds into a distinct three-dimensional structure as a result of intramolecular interactions. a signal sequence is a short tail of amino acids that directs a protein to a specific cellular compartment. these sequences at the amino end or the carboxyl end of the protein can be thought of as the proteins train ticket to its ultimate destination. other cellular factors recognize each signal sequence and help transport the protein from the cytoplasm to its correct compartment. for instance, a specific sequence at the amino terminus will direct a protein to the mitochondria or chloroplasts (in plants). once the protein reaches its cellular destination, the signal sequence is usually clipped off. many proteins fold spontaneously, but some proteins require helper molecules, called chaperones, to prevent them from aggregating during the complicated process of folding. even if a protein is properly specified by its corresponding mrna, it could take on a completely dysfunctional shape if abnormal temperature or ph conditions prevent it from folding correctly. the players in translation include the mrna template, ribosomes, trnas, and various enzymatic factors. the small ribosomal subunit forms on the mrna template either at the shine-dalgarno sequence (prokaryotes) or the 5' cap (eukaryotes). translation begins at the initiating aug on the mrna, specifying methionine. the formation of peptide bonds occurs between sequential amino acids specified by the mrna template according to the genetic code. charged trnas enter the ribosomal a site, and their amino acid bonds with the amino acid at the p site. the entire mrna is translated in three-nucleotide steps of the ribosome. when a nonsense codon is encountered, a release factor binds and dissociates the components and frees the new protein. folding of the protein occurs during and after translation.","[('initiator trna', 'initiator trnas'), ('start codon', 'start codons'), ('shine-dalgarno sequence', 'shine-dalgarno sequences'), ('ribosome', 'ribosomes'), ('protein', 'proteins'), ('aminoacyl trna synthetase', 'aminoacyl trna synthetases', 'aminoacyl trnas synthetase', 'aminoacyl trnas synthetases', 'aminoacyls trna synthetase', 'aminoacyls trna synthetases', 'aminoacyls trnas synthetase', 'aminoacyls trnas synthetases'), (""kozak' rule"", ""kozak' ruless"", ""kozak' rules""), ('gene', 'geness', 'genes'), ('gene', 'genes'), ('protein', 'proteinss', 'proteins'), ('signal sequence', 'signal sequences'), ('protein synthesi', 'protein syntheses', 'protein synthesis'), ('polysome', 'polysomes'), ('peptidyl transferase', 'peptidyl transferases')]"
77,stax-bio,16,Gene Expression,0,m44533,Introduction,"each somatic cell in the body generally contains the same dna. a few exceptions include red blood cells, which contain no dna in their mature state, and some immune system cells that rearrange their dna while producing antibodies. in general, however, the genes that determine whether you have green eyes, brown hair, and how fast you metabolize food are the same in the cells in your eyes and your liver, even though these organs function quite differently. if each cell has the same dna, how is it that cells or organs are different? why do cells in the eye differ so dramatically from cells in the liver? whereas each cell shares the same genome and dna sequence, each cell does not turn on, or express, the same set of genes. each cell type needs a different set of proteins to perform its function. therefore, only a small subset of proteins is expressed in a cell. for the proteins to be expressed, the dna must be transcribed into rna and the rna must be translated into protein. in a given cell type, not all genes encoded in the dna are transcribed into rna or translated into protein because specific cells in our body have specific functions. specialized proteins that make up the eye (iris, lens, and cornea) are only expressed in the eye, whereas the specialized proteins in the heart (pacemaker cells, heart muscle, and valves) are only expressed in the heart. at any given time, only a subset of all of the genes encoded by our dna are expressed and translated into proteins. the expression of specific genes is a highly regulated process with many levels and stages of control. this complexity ensures the proper expression in the proper cell at the proper time.","[('cis-acting element', 'cis-acting elements'),

78,stax-bio,16,Gene Expression,1,m44534,Regulation of Gene Expression,"for a cell to function properly, necessary proteins must be synthesized at the proper time. all cells control or regulate the synthesis of proteins from information encoded in their dna. the process of turning on a gene to produce rna and protein is called gene expression. whether in a simple unicellular organism or a complex multi-cellular organism, each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed. for this to occur, there must be a mechanism to control when a gene is expressed to make rna and protein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no longer needed. the regulation of gene expression conserves energy and space. it would require a significant amount of energy for an organism to express every gene at all times, so it is more energy efficient to turn on the genes only when they are required. in addition, only expressing a subset of genes in each cell saves space because dna must be unwound from its tightly coiled structure to transcribe and translate the dna. cells would have to be enormous if every protein were expressed in every cell all the time. the control of gene expression is extremely complex. malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell and can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer. to understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene codes for a functional protein in a cell. the process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different manners. prokaryotic organisms are single-celled organisms that lack a cell nucleus, and their dna therefore floats freely in the cell cytoplasm. to synthesize a protein, the processes of transcription and translation occur almost simultaneously. when the resulting protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. as a result, the primary method to control what type of protein and how much of each protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is the regulation of dna transcription. all of the subsequent steps occur automatically. when more protein is required, more transcription occurs. therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression is mostly at the transcriptional level. eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles that add to their complexity. in eukaryotic cells, the dna is contained inside the cells nucleus and there it is transcribed into rna. the newly synthesized rna is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the rna into protein. the processes of transcription and translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation occurs only outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm. the regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process ([link]). regulation may occur when the dna is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors (epigenetic level), when the rna is transcribed (transcriptional level), when the rna is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed (post-transcriptional level), when the rna is translated into protein (translational level), or after the protein has been made (post-translational level). the differences in the regulation of gene expression between prokaryotes and eukaryotes are summarized in [link]. the regulation of gene expression is discussed in detail in subsequent modules. evolution of gene regulationprokaryotic cells can only regulate gene expression by controlling the amount of transcription. as eukaryotic cells evolved, the complexity of the control of gene expression increased. for example, with the evolution of eukaryotic cells came compartmentalization of important cellular components and cellular processes. a nuclear region that contains the dna was formed. transcription and translation were physically separated into two different cellular compartments. it therefore became possible to control gene expression by regulating transcription in the nucleus, and also by controlling the rna levels and protein translation present outside the nucleus. some cellular processes arose from the need of the organism to defend itself. cellular processes such as gene silencing developed to protect the cell from viral or parasitic infections. if the cell could quickly shut off gene expression for a short period of time, it would be able to survive an infection when other organisms could not. therefore, the organism evolved a new process that helped it survive, and it was able to pass this new development to offspring. while all somatic cells within an organism contain the same dna, not all cells within that organism express the same proteins. prokaryotic organisms express the entire dna they encode in every cell, but not necessarily all at the same time. proteins are expressed only when they are needed. eukaryotic organisms express a subset of the dna that is encoded in any given cell. in each cell type, the type and amount of protein is regulated by controlling gene expression. to express a protein, the dna is first transcribed into rna, which is then translated into proteins. in prokaryotic cells, these processes occur almost simultaneously. in eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus and is separate from the translation that occurs in the cytoplasm. gene expression in prokaryotes is mostly regulated at the transcriptional level (some epigenetic and post-translational regulation is also present), whereas in eukaryotic cells, gene expression is regulated at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels.","[('epigenetic', 'epigenetics'), ('prokaryotic gene expression', 'prokaryotic gene expressions', 'prokaryotic genes expression', 'prokaryotic genes expressions'), ('eukaryotic gene expression', 'eukaryotic gene expressions', 'eukaryotic genes expression', 'eukaryotic genes expressions'), ('gene expression regulation', 'gene expression regulations', 'gene expressions regulation', 'gene expressions regulations', 'genes expression regulation', 'genes expression regulations', 'genes expressions regulation', 'genes expressions regulations'), ('post-translational', 'post-translationals'), ('gene expression', 'gene expressions'), ('post-transcriptional', 'post-transcriptionals'), ('regulation of gene expression', 'regulation of gene expression', 'regulation of genes expression', 'regulation of genes expression', 'regulations of gene expression', 'regulations of gene expression', 'regulations of genes expression', 'regulations of genes expression')]"
79,stax-bio,16,Gene Expression,2,m44535,Prokaryotic Gene Regulation,"the dna of prokaryotes is organized into a circular chromosome supercoiled in the nucleoid region of the cell cytoplasm. proteins that are needed for a specific function, or that are involved in the same biochemical pathway, are encoded together in blocks called operons. for example, all of the genes needed to use lactose as an energy source are coded next to each other in the lactose (or lac) operon. in prokaryotic cells, there are three types of regulatory molecules that can affect the expression of operons: repressors, activators, and inducers. repressors are proteins that suppress transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus, whereas activators are proteins that increase the transcription of a gene in response to an external stimulus. finally, inducers are small molecules that either activate or repress transcription depending on the needs of the cell and the availability of substrate. bacteria such as e. coli need amino acids to survive. tryptophan is one such amino acid that e. coli can ingest from the environment. e. coli can also synthesize tryptophan using enzymes that are encoded by five genes. these five genes are next to each other in what is called the tryptophan (trp) operon ([link]). if tryptophan is present in the environment, then e. coli does not need to synthesize it and the switch controlling the activation of the genes in the trp operon is switched off. however, when tryptophan availability is low, the switch controlling the operon is turned on, transcription is initiated, the genes are expressed, and tryptophan is synthesized. a dna sequence that codes for proteins is referred to as the coding region. the five coding regions for the tryptophan biosynthesis enzymes are arranged sequentially on the chromosome in the operon. just before the coding region is the transcriptional start site. this is the region of dna to which rna polymerase binds to initiate transcription. the promoter sequence is upstream of the transcriptional start site; each operon has a sequence within or near the promoter to which proteins (activators or repressors) can bind and regulate transcription. a dna sequence called the operator sequence is encoded between the promoter region and the first trp coding gene. this operator contains the dna code to which the repressor protein can bind. when tryptophan is present in the cell, two tryptophan molecules bind to the trp repressor, which changes shape to bind to the trp operator. binding of the tryptophanrepressor complex at the operator physically prevents the rna polymerase from binding, and transcribing the downstream genes. when tryptophan is not present in the cell, the repressor by itself does not bind to the operator; therefore, the operon is active and tryptophan is synthesized. because the repressor protein actively binds to the operator to keep the genes turned off, the trp operon is negatively regulated and the proteins that bind to the operator to silence trp expression are negative regulators. watch this video to learn more about the trp operon.

 just as the trp operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan molecules, there are proteins that bind to the operator sequences that act as a positive regulator to turn genes on and activate them. for example, when glucose is scarce, e. coli bacteria can turn to other sugar sources for fuel. to do this, new genes to process these alternate genes must be transcribed. when glucose levels drop, cyclic amp (camp) begins to accumulate in the cell. the camp molecule is a signaling molecule that is involved in glucose and energy metabolism in e. coli. when glucose levels decline in the cell, accumulating camp binds to the positive regulator catabolite activator protein (cap), a protein that binds to the promoters of operons that control the processing of alternative sugars. when camp binds to cap, the complex binds to the promoter region of the genes that are needed to use the alternate sugar sources ([link]). in these operons, a cap binding site is located upstream of the rna polymerase binding site in the promoter. this increases the binding ability of rna polymerase to the promoter region and the transcription of the genes. the third type of gene regulation in prokaryotic cells occurs through inducible operons, which have proteins that bind to activate or repress transcription depending on the local environment and the needs of the cell. the lac operon is a typical inducible operon. as mentioned previously, e. coli is able to use other sugars as energy sources when glucose concentrations are low. to do so, the campcap protein complex serves as a positive regulator to induce transcription. one such sugar source is lactose. the lac operon encodes the genes necessary to acquire and process the lactose from the local environment. cap binds to the operator sequence upstream of the promoter that initiates transcription of the lac operon. however, for the lac operon to be activated, two conditions must be met. first, the level of glucose must be very low or non-existent. second, lactose must be present. only when glucose is absent and lactose is present will the lac operon be transcribed ([link]). this makes sense for the cell, because it would be energetically wasteful to create the proteins to process lactose if glucose was plentiful or lactose was not available. if glucose is absent, then cap can bind to the operator sequence to activate transcription. if lactose is absent, then the repressor binds to the operator to prevent transcription. if either of these requirements is met, then transcription remains off. only when both conditions are satisfied is the lac operon transcribed ([link]). watch an animated tutorial about the workings of lac operon here.

 the regulation of gene expression in prokaryotic cells occurs at the transcriptional level. there are three ways to control the transcription of an operon: repressive control, activator control, and inducible control. repressive control, typified by the trp operon, uses proteins bound to the operator sequence to physically prevent the binding of rna polymerase and the activation of transcription. therefore, if tryptophan is not needed, the repressor is bound to the operator and transcription remains off. activator control, typified by the action of cap, increases the binding ability of rna polymerase to the promoter when cap is bound. in this case, low levels of glucose result in the binding of camp to cap. cap then binds the promoter, which allows rna polymerase to bind to the promoter better. in the last examplethe lac operontwo conditions must be met to initiate transcription. glucose must not be present, and lactose must be available for the lac operon to be transcribed. if glucose is absent, cap binds to the operator. if lactose is present, the repressor protein does not bind to its operator. only when both conditions are met will rna polymerase bind to the promoter to induce transcription.","[('negative regulator', 'negative regulators'), ('operator', 'operators'), ('operon', 'operons'), ('lac operon', 'lac operons'), ('catabolite activator protein', 'catabolite activator proteins', 'catabolites activator protein', 'catabolites activator proteins'), ('tryptophan', 'tryptophans'), ('inducible operon', 'inducible operons'), ('inducer', 'inducers'), ('repressor', 'repressors'), ('transcriptional start site', 'transcriptional start sites', 'transcriptional starts site', 'transcriptional starts sites'), ('prokaryotic gene regulation', 'prokaryotic gene regulations', 'prokaryotic genes regulation', 'prokaryotic genes regulations'), ('gene expression', 'gene expressions'), ('cap', 'caps'), ('activator', 'activators'), ('positive regulator', 'positive regulators'), ('trp operon', 'trp operons')]"
80,stax-bio,16,Gene Expression,3,m44536,Eukaryotic Epigenetic Gene Regulation,"eukaryotic gene expression is more complex than prokaryotic gene expression because the processes of transcription and translation are physically separated. unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells can regulate gene expression at many different levels. eukaryotic gene expression begins with control of access to the dna. this form of regulation, called epigenetic regulation, occurs even before transcription is initiated. the human genome encodes over 20,000 genes; each of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes encodes thousands of genes. the dna in the nucleus is precisely wound, folded, and compacted into chromosomes so that it will fit into the nucleus. it is also organized so that specific segments can be accessed as needed by a specific cell type. the first level of organization, or packing, is the winding of dna strands around histone proteins. histones package and order dna into structural units called nucleosome complexes, which can control the access of proteins to the dna regions ([link]a). under the electron microscope, this winding of dna around histone proteins to form nucleosomes looks like small beads on a string ([link]b). these beads (histone proteins) can move along the string (dna) and change the structure of the molecule. if dna encoding a specific gene is to be transcribed into rna, the nucleosomes surrounding that region of dna can slide down the dna to open that specific chromosomal region and allow for the transcriptional machinery (rna polymerase) to initiate transcription ([link]). nucleosomes can move to open the chromosome structure to expose a segment of dna, but do so in a very controlled manner. how the histone proteins move is dependent on signals found on both the histone proteins and on the dna. these signals are tags added to histone proteins and dna that tell the histones if a chromosomal region should be open or closed ([link] depicts modifications to histone proteins and dna). these tags are not permanent, but may be added or removed as needed. they are chemical modifications (phosphate, methyl, or acetyl groups) that are attached to specific amino acids in the protein or to the nucleotides of the dna. the tags do not alter the dna base sequence, but they do alter how tightly wound the dna is around the histone proteins. dna is a negatively charged molecule; therefore, changes in the charge of the histone will change how tightly wound the dna molecule will be. when unmodified, the histone proteins have a large positive charge; by adding chemical modifications like acetyl groups, the charge becomes less positive. the dna molecule itself can also be modified. this occurs within very specific regions called cpg islands. these are stretches with a high frequency of cytosine and guanine dinucleotide dna pairs (cg) found in the promoter regions of genes. when this configuration exists, the cytosine member of the pair can be methylated (a methyl group is added). this modification changes how the dna interacts with proteins, including the histone proteins that control access to the region. highly methylated (hypermethylated) dna regions with deacetylated histones are tightly coiled and transcriptionally inactive. this type of gene regulation is called epigenetic regulation. epigenetic means around genetics. the changes that occur to the histone proteins and dna do not alter the nucleotide sequence and are not permanent. instead, these changes are temporary (although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division) and alter the chromosomal structure (open or closed) as needed. a gene can be turned on or off depending upon the location and modifications to the histone proteins and dna. if a gene is to be transcribed, the histone proteins and dna are modified surrounding the chromosomal region encoding that gene. this opens the chromosomal region to allow access for rna polymerase and other proteins, called transcription factors, to bind to the promoter region, located just upstream of the gene, and initiate transcription. if a gene is to remain turned off, or silenced, the histone proteins and dna have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration. in this closed configuration, the rna polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to the dna and transcription cannot occur ([link]). view this video that describes how epigenetic regulation controls gene expression.

 in eukaryotic cells, the first stage of gene expression control occurs at the epigenetic level. epigenetic mechanisms control access to the chromosomal region to allow genes to be turned on or off. these mechanisms control how dna is packed into the nucleus by regulating how tightly the dna is wound around histone proteins. the addition or removal of chemical modifications (or flags) to histone proteins or dna signals to the cell to open or close a chromosomal region. therefore, eukaryotic cells can control whether a gene is expressed by controlling accessibility to transcription factors and the binding of rna polymerase to initiate transcription.","[('transcription factor', 'transcription factors'), ('histone modification', 'histone modifications'), ('epigenetic control', 'epigenetic controls'), ('epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic regulations'), ('gene expression', 'gene expressions'), ('epigenetic gene regulation', 'epigenetic gene regulations', 'epigenetic genes regulation', 'epigenetic genes regulations'), ('eukaryotic epigenetic gene regulation', 'eukaryotic epigenetic gene regulations', 'eukaryotic epigenetic genes regulation', 'eukaryotic epigenetic genes regulations')]"
81,stax-bio,16,Gene Expression,4,m44538,Eukaryotic Transcription Gene Regulation,"like prokaryotic cells, the transcription of genes in eukaryotes requires the actions of an rna polymerase to bind to a sequence upstream of a gene to initiate transcription. however, unlike prokaryotic cells, the eukaryotic rna polymerase requires other proteins, or transcription factors, to facilitate transcription initiation. transcription factors are proteins that bind to the promoter sequence and other regulatory sequences to control the transcription of the target gene. rna polymerase by itself cannot initiate transcription in eukaryotic cells. transcription factors must bind to the promoter region first and recruit rna polymerase to the site for transcription to be established. view the process of transcriptionthe making of rna from a dna template.

 genes are organized to make the control of gene expression easier. the promoter region is immediately upstream of the coding sequence. this region can be short (only a few nucleotides in length) or quite long (hundreds of nucleotides long). the longer the promoter, the more available space for proteins to bind. this also adds more control to the transcription process. the length of the promoter is gene-specific and can differ dramatically between genes. consequently, the level of control of gene expression can also differ quite dramatically between genes. the purpose of the promoter is to bind transcription factors that control the initiation of transcription. within the promoter region, just upstream of the transcriptional start site, resides the tata box. this box is simply a repeat of thymine and adenine dinucleotides (literally, tata repeats). rna polymerase binds to the transcription initiation complex, allowing transcription to occur. to initiate transcription, a transcription factor (tfiid) is the first to bind to the tata box. binding of tfiid recruits other transcription factors, including tfiib, tfiie, tfiif, and tfiih to the tata box. once this complex is assembled, rna polymerase can bind to its upstream sequence. when bound along with the transcription factors, rna polymerase is phosphorylated. this releases part of the protein from the dna to activate the transcription initiation complex and places rna polymerase in the correct orientation to begin transcription; dna-bending protein brings the enhancer, which can be quite a distance from the gene, in contact with transcription factors and mediator proteins ([link]). in addition to the general transcription factors, other transcription factors can bind to the promoter to regulate gene transcription. these transcription factors bind to the promoters of a specific set of genes. they are not general transcription factors that bind to every promoter complex, but are recruited to a specific sequence on the promoter of a specific gene. there are hundreds of transcription factors in a cell that each bind specifically to a particular dna sequence motif. when transcription factors bind to the promoter just upstream of the encoded gene, it is referred to as a cis-acting element, because it is on the same chromosome just next to the gene. the region that a particular transcription factor binds to is called the transcription factor binding site. transcription factors respond to environmental stimuli that cause the proteins to find their binding sites and initiate transcription of the gene that is needed. in some eukaryotic genes, there are regions that help increase or enhance transcription. these regions, called enhancers, are not necessarily close to the genes they enhance. they can be located upstream of a gene, within the coding region of the gene, downstream of a gene, or may be thousands of nucleotides away. enhancer regions are binding sequences, or sites, for transcription factors. when a dna-bending protein binds, the shape of the dna changes ([link]). this shape change allows for the interaction of the activators bound to the enhancers with the transcription factors bound to the promoter region and the rna polymerase. whereas dna is generally depicted as a straight line in two dimensions, it is actually a three-dimensional object. therefore, a nucleotide sequence thousands of nucleotides away can fold over and interact with a specific promoter. like prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells also have mechanisms to prevent transcription. transcriptional repressors can bind to promoter or enhancer regions and block transcription. like the transcriptional activators, repressors respond to external stimuli to prevent the binding of activating transcription factors. to start transcription, general transcription factors, such as tfiid, tfiih, and others, must first bind to the tata box and recruit rna polymerase to that location. the binding of additional regulatory transcription factors to cis-acting elements will either increase or prevent transcription. in addition to promoter sequences, enhancer regions help augment transcription. enhancers can be upstream, downstream, within a gene itself, or on other chromosomes. transcription factors bind to enhancer regions to increase or prevent transcription.","[('cis-acting element', 'cis-acting elements'), ('trans-acting element', 'trans-acting elements'), ('transcription factor', 'transcription factors'), ('transcription factor binding site', 'transcription factor binding sites', 'transcription factors binding site', 'transcription factors binding sites', 'transcriptions factor binding site', 'transcriptions factor binding sites', 'transcriptions factors binding site', 'transcriptions factors binding sites'), ('transcription', 'transcriptions'), ('repressor', 'repressors'), ('transcriptional gene regulation', 'transcriptional gene regulations', 'transcriptional genes regulation', 'transcriptional genes regulations'), ('gene regulation', 'gene regulations'), ('gene expression', 'gene expressions'), ('eukaryotic transcriptional gene regulation', 'eukaryotic transcriptional gene regulations', 'eukaryotic transcriptional genes regulation', 'eukaryotic transcriptional genes regulations'), ('enhancer', 'enhancers'), ('eukaryotic gene regulation', 'eukaryotic gene regulations', 'eukaryotic genes regulation', 'eukaryotic genes regulations')]"
82,stax-bio,16,Gene Expression,5,m44539,Eukaryotic Post-translational Gene Regulation,"rna is transcribed, but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin. this processing after an rna molecule has been transcribed, but before it is translated into a protein, is called post-transcriptional modification. as with the epigenetic and transcriptional stages of processing, this post-transcriptional step can also be regulated to control gene expression in the cell. if the rna is not processed, shuttled, or translated, then no protein will be synthesized. in eukaryotic cells, the rna transcript often contains regions, called introns, that are removed prior to translation. the regions of rna that code for protein are called exons ([link]). after an rna molecule has been transcribed, but prior to its departure from the nucleus to be translated, the rna is processed and the introns are removed by splicing. alternative rna splicingin the 1970s, genes were first observed that exhibited alternative rna splicing. alternative rna splicing is a mechanism that allows different protein products to be produced from one gene when different combinations of introns, and sometimes exons, are removed from the transcript ([link]). this alternative splicing can be haphazard, but more often it is controlled and acts as a mechanism of gene regulation, with the frequency of different splicing alternatives controlled by the cell as a way to control the production of different protein products in different cells or at different stages of development. alternative splicing is now understood to be a common mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes; according to one estimate, 70 percent of genes in humans are expressed as multiple proteins through alternative splicing. how could alternative splicing evolve? introns have a beginning and ending recognition sequence; it is easy to imagine the failure of the splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and instead find the end of the next intron, thus removing two introns and the intervening exon. in fact, there are mechanisms in place to prevent such intron skipping, but mutations are likely to lead to their failure. such mistakes would more than likely produce a nonfunctional protein. indeed, the cause of many genetic diseases is alternative splicing rather than mutations in a sequence. however, alternative splicing would create a protein variant without the loss of the original protein, opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new variant to new functions. gene duplication has played an important role in the evolution of new functions in a similar way by providing genes that may evolve without eliminating the original, functional protein. visualize how mrna splicing happens by watching the process in action in this video.

 before the mrna leaves the nucleus, it is given two protective ""caps"" that prevent the end of the strand from degrading during its journey. the 5' cap, which is placed on the 5' end of the mrna, is usually composed of a methylated guanosine triphosphate molecule (gtp). the  poly-a tail, which is attached to the 3' end, is usually composed of a series of adenine nucleotides. once the rna is transported to the cytoplasm, the length of time that the rna resides there can be controlled. each rna molecule has a defined lifespan and decays at a specific rate. this rate of decay can influence how much protein is in the cell. if the decay rate is increased, the rna will not exist in the cytoplasm as long, shortening the time for translation to occur. conversely, if the rate of decay is decreased, the rna molecule will reside in the cytoplasm longer and more protein can be translated. this rate of decay is referred to as the rna stability. if the rna is stable, it will be detected for longer periods of time in the cytoplasm. binding of proteins to the rna can influence its stability. proteins, called rna-binding proteins, or rbps, can bind to the regions of the rna just upstream or downstream of the protein-coding region. these regions in the rna that are not translated into protein are called the untranslated regions, or utrs. they are not introns (those have been removed in the nucleus). rather, these are regions that regulate mrna localization, stability, and protein translation. the region just before the protein-coding region is called the 5' utr, whereas the region after the coding region is called the 3' utr ([link]). the binding of rbps to these regions can increase or decrease the stability of an rna molecule, depending on the specific rbp that binds. in addition to rbps that bind to and control (increase or decrease) rna stability, other elements called micrornas can bind to the rna molecule. these micrornas, or mirnas, are short rna molecules that are only 2124 nucleotides in length. the mirnas are made in the nucleus as longer pre-mirnas. these pre-mirnas are chopped into mature mirnas by a protein called dicer. like transcription factors and rbps, mature mirnas recognize a specific sequence and bind to the rna; however, mirnas also associate with a ribonucleoprotein complex called the rna-induced silencing complex (risc). risc binds along with the mirna to degrade the target mrna. together, mirnas and the risc complex rapidly destroy the rna molecule. post-transcriptional control can occur at any stage after transcription, including rna splicing, nuclear shuttling, and rna stability. once rna is transcribed, it must be processed to create a mature rna that is ready to be translated. this involves the removal of introns that do not code for protein. spliceosomes bind to the signals that mark the exon/intron border to remove the introns and ligate the exons together. once this occurs, the rna is mature and can be translated. rna is created and spliced in the nucleus, but needs to be transported to the cytoplasm to be translated. rna is transported to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex. once the rna is in the cytoplasm, the length of time it resides there before being degraded, called rna stability, can also be altered to control the overall amount of protein that is synthesized. the rna stability can be increased, leading to longer residency time in the cytoplasm, or decreased, leading to shortened time and less protein synthesis. rna stability is controlled by rna-binding proteins (rpbs) and micrornas (mirnas). these rpbs and mirnas bind to the 5' utr or the 3' utr of the rna to increase or decrease rna stability. depending on the rbp, the stability can be increased or decreased significantly; however, mirnas always decrease stability and promote decay.","[('microrna', 'micrornas'), ('untranslated region', 'untranslated regions'), ('eukaryotic post-transcriptional gene regulation', 'eukaryotic post-transcriptional gene regulations', 'eukaryotic post-transcriptionals gene regulation', 'eukaryotic post-transcriptionals gene regulations'), ('mirna', 'mirnas'), (""5' utr"", ""5' utrs""), (""3' utr"", ""3' utrs""), ('a branch site', 'a branch sites', 'a branches site', 'a branches sites'), ('post-transcriptional gene regulation', 'post-transcriptional gene regulations', 'post-transcriptionals gene regulation', 'post-transcriptionals gene regulations'), ('rna-binding protein', 'rna-binding proteins'), ('dicer', 'dicers'), ('rbp', 'rbps'), ('gene expression', 'gene expressions'), ('gu dinucleotide signal', 'gu dinucleotide signals', 'gu dinucleotides signal', 'gu dinucleotides signals', 'gus dinucleotide signal', 'gus dinucleotide signals', 'gus dinucleotides signal', 'gus dinucleotides signals'), ('ag dinucleotide region', 'ag dinucleotide regions'), ('eukaryotic gene regulation', 'eukaryotic gene regulations', 'eukaryotic genes regulation', 'eukaryotic genes regulations')]"
83,stax-bio,16,Gene Expression,6,m44542,Eukaryotic Translational and Post-translational Gene Regulation,"after the rna has been transported to the cytoplasm, it is translated into protein. control of this process is largely dependent on the rna molecule. as previously discussed, the stability of the rna will have a large impact on its translation into a protein. as the stability changes, the amount of time that it is available for translation also changes. like transcription, translation is controlled by proteins that bind and initiate the process. in translation, the complex that assembles to start the process is referred to as the initiation complex. the first protein to bind to the rna to initiate translation is the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eif-2). the eif-2 protein is active when it binds to the high-energy molecule guanosine triphosphate (gtp). gtp provides the energy to start the reaction by giving up a phosphate and becoming guanosine diphosphate (gdp). the eif-2 protein bound to gtp binds to the small 40s ribosomal subunit. when bound, the methionine initiator trna associates with the eif-2/40s ribosome complex, bringing along with it the mrna to be translated. at this point, when the initiator complex is assembled, the gtp is converted into gdp and energy is released. the phosphate and the eif-2 protein are released from the complex and the large 60s ribosomal subunit binds to translate the rna. the binding of eif-2 to the rna is controlled by phosphorylation. if eif-2 is phosphorylated, it undergoes a conformational change and cannot bind to gtp. therefore, the initiation complex cannot form properly and translation is impeded ([link]). when eif-2 remains unphosphorylated, it binds the rna and actively translates the protein. proteins can be chemically modified with the addition of groups including methyl, phosphate, acetyl, and ubiquitin groups. the addition or removal of these groups from proteins regulates their activity or the length of time they exist in the cell. sometimes these modifications can regulate where a protein is found in the cellfor example, in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or attached to the plasma membrane. chemical modifications occur in response to external stimuli such as stress, the lack of nutrients, heat, or ultraviolet light exposure. these changes can alter epigenetic accessibility, transcription, mrna stability, or translationall resulting in changes in expression of various genes. this is an efficient way for the cell to rapidly change the levels of specific proteins in response to the environment.  because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation, the phosphorylation of a protein (depending on the protein that is modified) can alter accessibility to the chromosome, can alter translation (by altering transcription factor binding or function), can change nuclear shuttling (by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore complex), can alter rna stability (by binding or not binding to the rna to regulate its stability), can modify translation (increase or decrease), or can change post-translational modifications (add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications).  the addition of an ubiquitin group to a protein marks that protein for degradation. ubiquitin acts like a flag indicating that the protein lifespan is complete. these proteins are moved to the proteasome, an organelle that functions to remove proteins, to be degraded ([link]). one way to control gene expression, therefore, is to alter the longevity of the protein. changing the status of the rna or the protein itself can affect the amount of protein, the function of the protein, or how long it is found in the cell. to translate the protein, a protein initiator complex must assemble on the rna. modifications (such as phosphorylation) of proteins in this complex can prevent proper translation from occurring. once a protein has been synthesized, it can be modified (phosphorylated, acetylated, methylated, or ubiquitinated). these post-translational modifications can greatly impact the stability, degradation, or function of the protein.","[('eukaryotic post-translational gene regulation', 'eukaryotic post-translational gene regulations', 'eukaryotic post-translationals gene regulation', 'eukaryotic post-translationals gene

84,stax-bio,16,Gene Expression,7,m44548,Cancer and Gene Regulation,"cancer is not a single disease but includes many different diseases.  in cancer cells, mutations modify cell-cycle control and cells dont stop growing as they normally would. mutations can also alter the growth rate or the progression of the cell through the cell cycle. one example of a gene modification that alters the growth rate is increased phosphorylation of cyclin b, a protein that controls the progression of a cell through the cell cycle and serves as a cell-cycle checkpoint protein. for cells to move through each phase of the cell cycle, the cell must pass through checkpoints. this ensures that the cell has properly completed the step and has not encountered any mutation that will alter its function. many proteins, including cyclin b, control these checkpoints. the phosphorylation of cyclin b, a post-translational event, alters its function. as a result, cells can progress through the cell cycle unimpeded, even if mutations exist in the cell and its growth should be terminated. this post-translational change of cyclin b prevents it from controlling the cell cycle and contributes to the development of cancer. cancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. there are many proteins that are turned on or off (gene activation or gene silencing) that dramatically alter the overall activity of the cell. a gene that is not normally expressed in that cell can be switched on and expressed at high levels. this can be the result of gene mutation or changes in gene regulation (epigenetic, transcription, post-transcription, translation, or post-translation). changes in epigenetic regulation, transcription, rna stability, protein translation, and post-translational control can be detected in cancer. while these changes dont occur simultaneously in one cancer, changes at each of these levels can be detected when observing cancer at different sites in different individuals. therefore, changes in histone acetylation (epigenetic modification that leads to gene silencing), activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation, increased rna stability, increased translational control, and protein modification can all be detected at some point in various cancer cells. scientists are working to understand the common changes that give rise to certain types of cancer or how a modification might be exploited to destroy a tumor cell. in normal cells, some genes function to prevent excess, inappropriate cell growth. these are tumor suppressor genes, which are active in normal cells to prevent uncontrolled cell growth. there are many tumor suppressor genes in cells. the most studied tumor suppressor gene is p53, which is mutated in over 50 percent of all cancer types.  the p53 protein itself functions as a transcription factor. it can bind to sites in the promoters of genes to initiate transcription. therefore, the mutation of p53 in cancer will dramatically alter the transcriptional activity of its target genes. proto-oncogenes are positive cell-cycle regulators. when mutated, proto-oncogenes can become oncogenes and cause cancer. overexpression of the oncogene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. this is because oncogenes can alter transcriptional activity, stability, or protein translation of another gene that directly or indirectly controls cell growth. an example of an oncogene involved in cancer is a protein called myc. myc is a transcription factor that is aberrantly activated in burketts lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system. overexpression of myc transforms normal b cells into cancerous cells that continue to grow uncontrollably. high b-cell numbers can result in tumors that can interfere with normal bodily function. patients with burketts lymphoma can develop tumors on their jaw or in their mouth that interfere with the ability to eat. silencing genes through epigenetic mechanisms is also very common in cancer cells. there are characteristic modifications to histone proteins and dna that are associated with silenced genes. in cancer cells, the dna in the promoter region of silenced genes is methylated on cytosine dna residues in cpg islands. histone proteins that surround that region lack the acetylation modification that is present when the genes are expressed in normal cells. this combination of dna methylation and histone deacetylation (epigenetic modifications that lead to gene silencing) is commonly found in cancer. when these modifications occur, the gene present in that chromosomal region is silenced. increasingly, scientists understand how epigenetic changes are altered in cancer. because these changes are temporary and can be reversedfor example, by preventing the action of the histone deacetylase protein that removes acetyl groups, or by dna methyl transferase enzymes that add methyl groups to cytosines in dnait is possible to design new drugs and new therapies to take advantage of the reversible nature of these processes. indeed, many researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be switched back on in a cancer cell to help re-establish normal growth patterns. genes involved in the development of many other illnesses, ranging from allergies to inflammation to autism, are thought to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. as our knowledge of how genes are controlled deepens, new ways to treat diseases like cancer will emerge. alterations in cells that give rise to cancer can affect the transcriptional control of gene expression. mutations that activate transcription factors, such as increased phosphorylation, can increase the binding of a transcription factor to its binding site in a promoter. this could lead to increased transcriptional activation of that gene that results in modified cell growth. alternatively, a mutation in the dna of a promoter or enhancer region can increase the binding ability of a transcription factor. this could also lead to the increased transcription and aberrant gene expression that is seen in cancer cells. researchers have been investigating how to control the transcriptional activation of gene expression in cancer. identifying how a transcription factor binds, or a pathway that activates where a gene can be turned off, has led to new drugs and new ways to treat cancer. in breast cancer, for example, many proteins are overexpressed. this can lead to increased phosphorylation of key transcription factors that increase transcription. one such example is the overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) in a subset of breast cancers. the egfr pathway activates many protein kinases that, in turn, activate many transcription factors that control genes involved in cell growth. new drugs that prevent the activation of egfr have been developed and are used to treat these cancers. changes in the post-transcriptional control of a gene can also result in cancer. recently, several groups of researchers have shown that specific cancers have altered expression of mirnas. because mirnas bind to the 3' utr of rna molecules to degrade them, overexpression of these mirnas could be detrimental to normal cellular activity. too many mirnas could dramatically decrease the rna population leading to a decrease in protein expression. several studies have demonstrated a change in the mirna population in specific cancer types. it appears that the subset of mirnas expressed in breast cancer cells is quite different from the subset expressed in lung cancer cells or even from normal breast cells. this suggests that alterations in mirna activity can contribute to the growth of breast cancer cells. these types of studies also suggest that if some mirnas are specifically expressed only in cancer cells, they could be potential drug targets. it would, therefore, be conceivable that new drugs that turn off mirna expression in cancer could be an effective method to treat cancer. there are many examples of how translational or post-translational modifications of proteins arise in cancer. modifications are found in cancer cells from the increased translation of a protein to changes in protein phosphorylation to alternative splice variants of a protein. an example of how the expression of an alternative form of a protein can have dramatically different outcomes is seen in colon cancer cells. the c-flip protein, a protein involved in mediating the cell death pathway, comes in two forms: long (c-flipl) and short (c-flips). both forms appear to be involved in initiating controlled cell death mechanisms in normal cells. however, in colon cancer cells, expression of the long form results in increased cell growth instead of cell death. clearly, the expression of the wrong protein dramatically alters cell function and contributes to the development of cancer. scientists are using what is known about the regulation of gene expression in disease states, including cancer, to develop new ways to treat and prevent disease development. many scientists are designing drugs on the basis of the gene expression patterns within individual tumors. this idea, that therapy and medicines can be tailored to an individual, has given rise to the field of personalized medicine. with an increased understanding of gene regulation and gene function, medicines can be designed to specifically target diseased cells without harming healthy cells. some new medicines, called targeted therapies, have exploited the overexpression of a specific protein or the mutation of a gene to develop a new medication to treat disease. one such example is the use of anti-egf receptor medications to treat the subset of breast cancer tumors that have very high levels of the egf protein. undoubtedly, more targeted therapies will be developed as scientists learn more about how gene expression changes can cause cancer. a clinical trial coordinator is the person managing the proceedings of the clinical trial. this job includes coordinating patient schedules and appointments, maintaining detailed notes, building the database to track patients (especially for long-term follow-up studies), ensuring proper documentation has been acquired and accepted, and working with the nurses and doctors to facilitate the trial and publication of the results. a clinical trial coordinator may have a science background, like a nursing degree, or other certification. people who have worked in science labs or in clinical offices are also qualified to become a clinical trial coordinator. these jobs are generally in hospitals; however, some clinics and doctors offices also conduct clinical trials and may hire a coordinator. cancer can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. changes at every level of eukaryotic gene expression can be detected in some form of cancer at some point in time. in order to understand how changes to gene expression can cause cancer, it is critical to understand how each stage of gene regulation works in normal cells. by understanding the mechanisms of control in normal, non-diseased cells, it will be easier for scientists to understand what goes wrong in disease states including complex ones like cancer.","[('dna methylation', 'dna methylations'), ('myc', 'mycs'), ('cancer', 'cancers'), ('histone acetylation', 'histone

the study of nucleic acids began with the discovery of dna, progressed to the study of genes and small fragments, and has now exploded to the field of genomics. genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species. the advances in genomics have been made possible by dna sequencing technology. just as information technology has led to google maps that enable people to get detailed information about locations around the globe, genomic information is used to create similar maps of the dna of different organisms. these findings have helped anthropologists to better understand human migration and have aided the field of medicine through the mapping of human genetic diseases. the ways in which genomic information can contribute to scientific understanding are varied and quickly growing.","[('ti plasmid', 'ti plasmids'), ('recombinant protein', 'recombinant proteins'), ('reverse transcriptase pcr', 'reverse transcriptase pcrs', 'reverse transcriptases pcr', 'reverse transcriptases pcrs'), ('shotgun sequencing', 'shotgun sequencings'), ('rt-pcr', 'rt-pcrs'), ('radiation hybrid mapping', 'radiation hybrid mappings', 'radiations hybrid mapping', 'radiations hybrid mappings'), ('system biology', 'system biologies'), ('single nucleotide polymorphism', 'single nucleotide polymorphisms', 'single nucleotides polymorphism', 'single nucleotides polymorphisms'), ('protein signature', 'protein signatures'), ('toxicogenomic', 'toxicogenomicss', 'toxicogenomics'), ('sequence mapping', 'sequence mappings'), ('reverse genetic', 'reverse geneticss', 'reverse genetics'), ('whole genome sequencing', 'whole genome sequencings', 'whole genomes sequencing', 'whole genomes sequencings'), ('variable number of tandem repeat', 'variable number of tandem repeatss', 'variable number of tandem repeats', 'variable number of tandems repeat', 'variable number of tandems repeatss', 'variable number of tandems repeats', 'variable numbers of tandem repeat', 'variable numbers of tandem repeatss', 'variable numbers of tandem repeats', 'variable numbers of tandems repeat', 'variable numbers of tandems repeatss', 'variable numbers of tandems repeats'), ('restriction endonuclease', 'restriction endonucleases'), ('reproductive cloning', 'reproductive clonings'), ('pure culture', 'pure cultures'), ('probe', 'probes'), ('proteomic', 'proteomicss', 'proteomics'), ('restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'restriction fragment length polymorphisms', 'restriction fragment lengths polymorphism', 'restriction fragment lengths polymorphisms', 'restriction fragments length polymorphism', 'restriction fragments length polymorphisms', 'restriction fragments lengths polymorphism', 'restriction fragments lengths polymorphisms', 'restrictions fragment length polymorphism', 'restrictions fragment length polymorphisms', 'restrictions fragment lengths polymorphism', 'restrictions fragment lengths polymorphisms', 'restrictions fragments length polymorphism', 'restrictions fragments length polymorphisms', 'restrictions fragments lengths polymorphism', 'restrictions fragments lengths polymorphisms'), ('ribonuclease', 'ribonucleases'), ('protease', 'proteases'), ('transgenic', 'transgenics'), ('recombinant dna', 'recombinant dnas'), ('southern blotting', 'southern blottings')]"
86,stax-bio,17,Biotechnology and Genomics,1,m44552,Biotechnology,"biotechnology is the use of biological agents for technological advancement. biotechnology was used for breeding livestock and crops long before the scientific basis of these techniques was understood. since the discovery of the structure of dna in 1953, the field of biotechnology has grown rapidly through both academic research and private companies. the primary applications of this technology are in medicine (production of vaccines and antibiotics) and agriculture (genetic modification of crops, such as to increase yields). biotechnology also has many industrial applications, such as fermentation, the treatment of oil spills, and the production of biofuels ([link]). to understand the basic techniques used to work with nucleic acids, remember that nucleic acids are macromolecules made of nucleotides (a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds. the phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge. an entire set of dna molecules in the nucleus is called the genome. dna has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases. the two strands can be separated by exposure to high temperatures (dna denaturation) and can be reannealed by cooling. the dna can be replicated by the dna polymerase enzyme. unlike dna, which is located in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, rna molecules leave the nucleus. the most common type of rna that is analyzed is the messenger rna (mrna) because it represents the protein-coding genes that are actively expressed. however, rna molecules present some other challenges to analysis, as they are often less stable than dna. to study or manipulate nucleic acids, the dna or rna must first be isolated or extracted from the cells. various techniques are used to extract different types of dna ([link]). most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell and use enzymatic reactions to destroy all macromolecules that are not desired (such as degradation of unwanted molecules and separation from the dna sample). cells are broken using a lysis buffer (a solution which is mostly a detergent); lysis means to split. these enzymes break apart lipid molecules in the cell membranes and nuclear membranes. macromolecules are inactivated using enzymes such as proteases that break down proteins, and ribonucleases (rnases) that break down rna. the dna is then precipitated using alcohol. human genomic dna is usually visible as a gelatinous, white mass. the dna samples can be stored frozen at 80c for several years. rna analysis is performed to study gene expression patterns in cells. rna is naturally very unstable because rnases are commonly present in nature and very difficult to inactivate. similar to dna, rna extraction involves the use of various buffers and enzymes to inactivate macromolecules and preserve the rna. because nucleic acids are negatively charged ions at neutral or basic ph in an aqueous environment, they can be mobilized by an electric field. gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate molecules on the basis of size, using this charge. the nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or fragments. the nucleic acids are loaded into a slot near the negative electrode of a semisolid, porous gel matrix and pulled toward the positive electrode at the opposite end of the gel. smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. there are molecular weight standard samples that can be run alongside the molecules to provide a size comparison. nucleic acids in a gel matrix can be observed using various fluorescent or colored dyes. distinct nucleic acid fragments appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) on the basis of their size ([link]). a mixture of genomic dna fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic dna is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel. although genomic dna is visible to the naked eye when it is extracted in bulk, dna analysis often requires focusing on one or more specific regions of the genome. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a technique used to amplify specific regions of dna for further analysis ([link]). pcr is used for many purposes in laboratories, such as the cloning of gene fragments to analyze genetic diseases, identification of contaminant foreign dna in a sample, and the amplification of dna for sequencing. more practical applications include the determination of paternity and detection of genetic diseases. dna fragments can also be amplified from an rna template in a process called reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr).  the first step is to recreate the original dna template strand (called cdna) by applying dna nucleotides to the mrna. this process is called reverse transcription. this requires the presence of an enzyme called reverse transcriptase. after the cdna is made, regular pcr can be used to amplify it. nucleic acid samples, such as fragmented genomic dna and rna extracts, can be probed for the presence of certain sequences. short dna fragments called probes are designed and labeled with radioactive or fluorescent dyes to aid detection. gel electrophoresis separates the nucleic acid fragments according to their size. the fragments in the gel are then transferred onto a nylon membrane in a procedure called blotting ([link]). the nucleic acid fragments that are bound to the surface of the membrane can then be probed with specific radioactively or fluorescently labeled probe sequences. when dna is transferred to a nylon membrane, the technique is called southern blotting, and when rna is transferred to a nylon membrane, it is called northern blotting. southern blots are used to detect the presence of certain dna sequences in a given genome, and northern blots are used to detect gene expression. in general, the word cloning means the creation of a perfect replica; however, in biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is referred to as reproductive cloning. long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers learned how to reproduce desired regions or fragments of the genome, a process that is referred to as molecular cloning. cloning small fragments of the genome allows for the manipulation and study of specific genes (and their protein products), or noncoding regions in isolation. a plasmid (also called a vector) is a small circular dna molecule that replicates independently of the chromosomal dna. in cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a ""folder"" in which to insert a desired dna fragment. plasmids are usually introduced into a bacterial host for proliferation. in the bacterial context, the fragment of dna from the human genome (or the genome of another organism that is being studied) is referred to as foreign dna, or a transgene, to differentiate it from the dna of the bacterium, which is called the host dna. plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as escherichia coli) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). plasmids have been repurposed and engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and the large-scale production of important reagents, such as insulin and human growth hormone. an important feature of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign dna fragment can be introduced via the multiple cloning site (mcs). the mcs is a short dna sequence containing multiple sites that can be cut with different commonly available restriction endonucleases. restriction endonucleases recognize specific dna sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign dna. many restriction endonucleases make staggered cuts in the two strands of dna, such that the cut ends have a 2- or 4-base single-stranded overhang. because these overhangs are capable of annealing with complementary overhangs, these are called sticky ends. addition of an enzyme called dna ligase permanently joins the dna fragments via phosphodiester bonds. in this way, any dna fragment generated by restriction endonuclease cleavage can be spliced between the two ends of a plasmid dna that has been cut with the same restriction endonuclease ([link]). plasmids with foreign dna inserted into them are called recombinant dna molecules because they are created artificially and do not occur in nature. they are also called chimeric molecules because the origin of different parts of the molecules can be traced back to different species of biological organisms or even to chemical synthesis. proteins that are expressed from recombinant dna molecules are called recombinant proteins. not all recombinant plasmids are capable of expressing genes. the recombinant dna may need to be moved into a different vector (or host) that is better designed for gene expression. plasmids may also be engineered to express proteins only when stimulated by certain environmental factors, so that scientists can control the expression of the recombinant proteins. unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, naturally produce clones of themselves when they replicate asexually by binary fission; this is known as cellular cloning. the nuclear dna duplicates by the process of mitosis, which creates an exact replica of the genetic material. reproductive cloning is a method used to make a clone or an identical copy of an entire multicellular organism. most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves genetic hybridization of two individuals (parents), making it impossible for generation of an identical copy or a clone of either parent. recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to artificially induce asexual reproduction of mammals in the laboratory. parthenogenesis, or virgin birth, occurs when an embryo grows and develops without the fertilization of the egg occurring; this is a form of asexual reproduction. an example of parthenogenesis occurs in species in which the female lays an egg and if the egg is fertilized, it is a diploid egg and the individual develops into a female; if the egg is not fertilized, it remains a haploid egg and develops into a male. the unfertilized egg is called a parthenogenic, or virgin, egg. some insects and reptiles lay parthenogenic eggs that can develop into adults. sexual reproduction requires two cells; when the haploid egg and sperm cells fuse, a diploid zygote results. the zygote nucleus contains the genetic information to produce a new individual. however, early embryonic development requires the cytoplasmic material contained in the egg cell. this idea forms the basis for reproductive cloning. therefore, if the haploid nucleus of an egg cell is replaced with a diploid nucleus from the cell of any individual of the same species (called a donor), it will become a zygote that is genetically identical to the donor. somatic cell nuclear transfer is the technique of transferring a diploid nucleus into an enucleated egg. it can be used for either therapeutic cloning or reproductive cloning. the first cloned animal was dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. the success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low. dolly lived for seven years and died of respiratory complications ([link]). there is speculation that because the cell dna belongs to an older individual, the age of the dna may affect the life expectancy of a cloned individual. since dolly, several animals such as horses, bulls, and goats have been successfully cloned, although these individuals often exhibit facial, limb, and cardiac abnormalities. there have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells, sometimes referred to as cloning for therapeutic purposes. therapeutic cloning produces stem cells to attempt to remedy detrimental diseases or defects (unlike reproductive cloning, which aims to reproduce an organism). still, therapeutic cloning efforts have met with resistance because of bioethical considerations. genetic engineering is the alteration of an organisms genotype using recombinant dna technology to modify an organisms dna to achieve desirable traits. the addition of foreign dna in the form of recombinant dna vectors generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. the organism that receives the recombinant dna is called a genetically modified organism (gmo). if the foreign dna that is introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is called transgenic. bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes. in the us, gmos such as roundup-ready soybeans and borer-resistant corn are part of many common processed foods. although classical methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the dna sequence level and ask: ""what does this gene or dna element do?"" this technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classic genetic methodology.  this method would be similar to damaging a body part to determine its function. an insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the function of the wing is flight. the classical genetic method would compare insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observe that the non-flying insects have lost wings. similarly, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function. the methods used to disable gene function are collectively called gene targeting. gene targeting is the use of recombinant dna vectors to alter the expression of a particular gene, either by introducing mutations in a gene, or by eliminating the expression of a certain gene by deleting a part or all of the gene sequence from the genome of an organism. it is easy to see how biotechnology can be used for medicinal purposes. knowledge of the genetic makeup of our species, the genetic basis of heritable diseases, and the invention of technology to manipulate and fix mutant genes provides methods to treat the disease. biotechnology in agriculture can enhance resistance to disease, pest, and environmental stress, and improve both crop yield and quality. the process of testing for suspected genetic defects before administering treatment is called genetic diagnosis by genetic testing. depending on the inheritance patterns of a disease-causing gene, family members are advised to undergo genetic testing. for example, women diagnosed with breast cancer are usually advised to have a biopsy so that the medical team can determine the genetic basis of cancer development. treatment plans are based on the findings of genetic tests that determine the type of cancer. if the cancer is caused by inherited gene mutations, other female relatives are also advised to undergo genetic testing and periodic screening for breast cancer. genetic testing is also offered for fetuses (or embryos with in vitro fertilization) to determine the presence or absence of disease-causing genes in families with specific debilitating diseases. gene therapy is a genetic engineering technique used to cure disease. in its simplest form, it involves the introduction of a good gene at a random location in the genome to aid the cure of a disease that is caused by a mutated gene. the good gene is usually introduced into diseased cells as part of a vector transmitted by a virus that can infect the host cell and deliver the foreign dna ([link]). more advanced forms of gene therapy try to correct the mutation at the original site in the genome, such as is the case with treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency (scid). traditional vaccination strategies use weakened or inactive forms of microorganisms to mount the initial immune response. modern techniques use the genes of microorganisms cloned into vectors to mass produce the desired antigen. the antigen is then introduced into the body to stimulate the primary immune response and trigger immune memory. genes cloned from the influenza virus have been used to combat the constantly changing strains of this virus. antibiotics are a biotechnological product. they are naturally produced by microorganisms, such as fungi, to attain an advantage over bacterial populations. antibiotics are produced on a large scale by cultivating and manipulating fungal cells. recombinant dna technology was used to produce large-scale quantities of human insulin in e. coli as early as 1978. previously, it was only possible to treat diabetes with pig insulin, which caused allergic reactions in humans because of differences in the gene product. in addition, human growth hormone (hgh) is used to treat growth disorders in children. the hgh gene was cloned from a cdna library and inserted into e. coli cells by cloning it into a bacterial vector. although several recombinant proteins used in medicine are successfully produced in bacteria, some proteins require a eukaryotic animal host for proper processing. for this reason, the desired genes are cloned and expressed in animals, such as sheep, goats, chickens, and mice. animals that have been modified to express recombinant dna are called transgenic animals. several human proteins are expressed in the milk of transgenic sheep and goats, and some are expressed in the eggs of chickens. mice have been used extensively for expressing and studying the effects of recombinant genes and mutations. manipulating the dna of plants (i.e., creating gmos) has helped to create desirable traits, such as disease resistance, herbicide and pesticide resistance, better nutritional value, and better shelf-life ([link]). plants are the most important source of food for the human population. farmers developed ways to select for plant varieties with desirable traits long before modern-day biotechnology practices were established. plants that have received recombinant dna from other species are called transgenic plants. because they are not natural, transgenic plants and other gmos are closely monitored by government agencies to ensure that they are fit for human consumption and do not endanger other plant and animal life. because foreign genes can spread to other species in the environment, extensive testing is required to ensure ecological stability. staples like corn, potatoes, and tomatoes were the first crop plants to be genetically engineered. gene transfer occurs naturally between species in microbial populations. many viruses that cause human diseases, such as cancer, act by incorporating their dna into the human genome. in plants, tumors caused by the bacterium agrobacterium tumefaciens occur by transfer of dna from the bacterium to the plant. although the tumors do not kill the plants, they make the plants stunted and more susceptible to harsh environmental conditions. many plants, such as walnuts, grapes, nut trees, and beets, are affected by a. tumefaciens. the artificial introduction of dna into plant cells is more challenging than in animal cells because of the thick plant cell wall. researchers used the natural transfer of dna from agrobacterium to a plant host to introduce dna fragments of their choice into plant hosts. in nature, the disease-causing a. tumefaciens have a set of plasmids, called the ti plasmids (tumor-inducing plasmids), that contain genes for the production of tumors in plants. dna from the ti plasmid integrates into the infected plant cells genome. researchers manipulate the ti plasmids to remove the tumor-causing genes and insert the desired dna fragment for transfer into the plant genome.  the ti plasmids carry antibiotic resistance genes to aid selection and can be propagated in e. coli cells as well. bacillus thuringiensis (bt) is a bacterium that produces protein crystals during sporulation that are toxic to many insect species that affect plants. bt toxin has to be ingested by insects for the toxin to be activated. insects that have eaten bt toxin stop feeding on the plants within a few hours. after the toxin is activated in the intestines of the insects, death occurs within a couple of days. modern biotechnology has allowed plants to encode their own crystal bt toxin that acts against insects. the crystal toxin genes have been cloned from bt and introduced into plants. bt toxin has been found to be safe for the environment, non-toxic to humans and other mammals, and is approved for use by organic farmers as a natural insecticide. the first gm crop to be introduced into the market was the flavr savr tomato produced in 1994. antisense rna technology was used to slow down the process of softening and rotting caused by fungal infections, which led to increased shelf life of the gm tomatoes. additional genetic modification improved the flavor of this tomato. the flavr savr tomato did not successfully stay in the market because of problems maintaining and shipping the crop. nucleic acids can be isolated from cells for the purposes of further analysis by breaking open the cells and enzymatically destroying all other major macromolecules. fragmented or whole chromosomes can be separated on the basis of size by gel electrophoresis. short stretches of dna or rna can be amplified by pcr. southern and northern blotting can be used to detect the presence of specific short sequences in a dna or rna sample. the term cloning may refer to cloning small dna fragments (molecular cloning), cloning cell populations (cellular cloning), or cloning entire organisms (reproductive cloning). genetic testing is performed to identify disease-causing genes, and gene therapy is used to cure an inheritable disease. transgenic organisms possess dna from a different species, usually generated by molecular cloning techniques. vaccines, antibiotics, and hormones are examples of products obtained by recombinant dna technology. transgenic plants are usually created to improve characteristics of crop plants.","[('dna extraction', 'dna extractions'), ('gmo', 'gmoes'), ('gene targeting', 'gene targetings'), ('northern blotting', 'northern blottings'), ('biotechnology', 'biotechnologies'),

87,stax-bio,17,Biotechnology and Genomics,2,m44554,Mapping Genomes,"genomics is the study of entire genomes, including the complete set of genes, their nucleotide sequence and organization, and their interactions within a species and with other species. genome mapping is the process of finding the locations of genes on each chromosome. the maps created by genome mapping are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. a genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). a genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that co-segregates (shows genetic linkage) with a specific trait. early geneticists called this linkage analysis. physical maps present the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map). a physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome. having a complete map of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis. genome mapping can be used in a variety of other applications, such as using live microbes to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. research involving plant genome mapping may lead to producing higher crop yields or developing plants that better adapt to climate change. the study of genetic maps begins with linkage analysis, a procedure that analyzes the recombination frequency between genes to determine if they are linked or show independent assortment. the term linkage was used before the discovery of dna. early geneticists relied on the observation of phenotypic changes to understand the genotype of an organism. shortly after gregor mendel (the father of modern genetics) proposed that traits were determined by what are now known as genes, other researchers observed that different traits were often inherited together, and thereby deduced that the genes were physically linked by being located on the same chromosome. the mapping of genes relative to each other based on linkage analysis led to the development of the first genetic maps. observations that certain traits were always linked and certain others were not linked came from studying the offspring of crosses between parents with different traits. for example, in experiments performed on the garden pea, it was discovered that the color of the flower and shape of the plants pollen were linked traits, and therefore the genes encoding these traits were in close proximity on the same chromosome. the exchange of dna between homologous pairs of chromosomes is called genetic recombination, which occurs by the crossing over of dna between homologous strands of dna, such as nonsister chromatids. linkage analysis involves studying the recombination frequency between any two genes. the greater the distance between two genes, the higher the chance that a recombination event will occur between them, and the higher the recombination frequency between them. two possibilities for recombination between two nonsister chromatids during meiosis are shown in [link]. if the recombination frequency between two genes is less than 50 percent, they are said to be linked. the generation of genetic maps requires markers, just as a road map requires landmarks (such as rivers and mountains). early genetic maps were based on the use of known genes as markers. more sophisticated markers, including those based on non-coding dna, are now used to compare the genomes of individuals in a population. although individuals of a given species are genetically similar, they are not identical; every individual has a unique set of traits. these minor differences in the genome between individuals in a population are useful for the purposes of genetic mapping. in general, a good genetic marker is a region on the chromosome that shows variability or polymorphism (multiple forms) in the population. some genetic markers used in generating genetic maps are restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflp), variable number of tandem repeats (vntrs), microsatellite polymorphisms, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). rflps (sometimes pronounced rif-lips) are detected when the dna of an individual is cut with a restriction endonuclease that recognizes specific sequences in the dna to generate a series of dna fragments, which are then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. the dna of every individual will give rise to a unique pattern of bands when cut with a particular set of restriction endonucleases; this is sometimes referred to as an individuals dna fingerprint. certain regions of the chromosome that are subject to polymorphism will lead to the generation of the unique banding pattern. vntrs are repeated sets of nucleotides present in the non-coding regions of dna. non-coding, or junk, dna has no known biological function; however, research shows that much of this dna is actually transcribed. while its function is uncertain, it is certainly active, and it may be involved in the regulation of coding genes. the number of repeats may vary in individual organisms of a population. microsatellite polymorphisms are similar to vntrs, but the repeat unit is very small. snps are variations in a single nucleotide. because genetic maps rely completely on the natural process of recombination, mapping is affected by natural increases or decreases in the level of recombination in any given area of the genome. some parts of the genome are recombination hotspots, whereas others do not show a propensity for recombination. for this reason, it is important to look at mapping information developed by multiple methods. a physical map provides detail of the actual physical distance between genetic markers, as well as the number of nucleotides. there are three methods used to create a physical map: cytogenetic mapping, radiation hybrid mapping, and sequence mapping. cytogenetic mapping uses information obtained by microscopic analysis of stained sections of the chromosome ([link]). it is possible to determine the approximate distance between genetic markers using cytogenetic mapping, but not the exact distance (number of base pairs). radiation hybrid mapping uses radiation, such as x-rays, to break the dna into fragments. the amount of radiation can be adjusted to create smaller or larger fragments. this technique overcomes the limitation of genetic mapping and is not affected by increased or decreased recombination frequency. sequence mapping resulted from dna sequencing technology that allowed for the creation of detailed physical maps with distances measured in terms of the number of base pairs. the creation of genomic libraries and complementary dna (cdna) libraries (collections of cloned sequences or all dna from a genome) has sped up the process of physical mapping. a genetic site used to generate a physical map with sequencing technology (a sequence-tagged site, or sts) is a unique sequence in the genome with a known exact chromosomal location. an expressed sequence tag (est) and a single sequence length polymorphism (sslp) are common stss. an est is a short sts that is identified with cdna libraries, while sslps are obtained from known genetic markers and provide a link between genetic maps and physical maps. genetic maps provide the outline and physical maps provide the details. it is easy to understand why both types of genome mapping techniques are important to show the big picture. information obtained from each technique is used in combination to study the genome. genomic mapping is being used with different model organisms that are used for research. genome mapping is still an ongoing process, and as more advanced techniques are developed, more advances are expected. genome mapping is similar to completing a complicated puzzle using every piece of available data. mapping information generated in laboratories all over the world is entered into central databases, such as genbank at the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi). efforts are being made to make the information more easily accessible to researchers and the general public. just as we use global positioning systems instead of paper maps to navigate through roadways, ncbi has created a genome viewer tool to simplify the data-mining process. how to use a genome map viewer problem statement: do the human, macaque, and mouse genomes contain common dna sequences? develop a hypothesis. to test the hypothesis, click this link. in search box on the left panel, type any gene name or phenotypic characteristic, such as iris pigmentation (eye color). select the species you want to study, and then press enter. the genome map viewer will indicate which chromosome encodes the gene in your search. click each hit in the genome viewer for more detailed information. this type of search is the most basic use of the genome viewer; it can also be used to compare sequences between species, as well as many other complicated tasks. is the hypothesis correct? why or why not? genome mapping is similar to solving a big, complicated puzzle with pieces of information coming from laboratories all over the world. genetic maps provide an outline for the location of genes within a genome, and they estimate the distance between genes and genetic markers on the basis of recombination frequencies during meiosis. physical maps provide detailed information about the physical distance between the genes. the most detailed information is available through sequence mapping. information from all mapping and sequencing sources is combined to study an entire genome.","[('genome annotation', 'genome annotations'), ('genomic', 'genomicss', 'genomics'), ('single nucleotide polymorphism', 'single nucleotide polymorphisms', 'single nucleotides polymorphism', 'single nucleotides polymorphisms'), ('whole genome sequencing', 'whole genome sequencings', 'whole genomes sequencing', 'whole genomes sequencings'), ('shotgun sequencing', 'shotgun sequencings'), ('dna microarray', 'dna microarrays'), ('microsatellite polymorphism', 'microsatellite polymorphisms'), ('restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'restriction fragment length polymorphisms', 'restriction fragment lengths polymorphism', 'restriction fragment lengths polymorphisms', 'restriction fragments length polymorphism', 'restriction fragments length polymorphisms', 'restriction fragments lengths polymorphism', 'restriction fragments lengths polymorphisms', 'restrictions fragment length polymorphism', 'restrictions fragment length polymorphisms', 'restrictions fragment lengths polymorphism', 'restrictions fragment lengths polymorphisms', 'restrictions fragments length polymorphism', 'restrictions fragments length polymorphisms', 'restrictions fragments lengths polymorphism', 'restrictions fragments lengths polymorphisms'), ('radiation hybrid mapping', 'radiation hybrid mappings', 'radiations hybrid mapping', 'radiations hybrid mappings'), ('biotechnology', 'biotechnologies'), ('next-generation sequencing', 'next-generation sequencings'), ('variable number of tandem repeat', 'variable number of tandem repeatss', 'variable number of tandem repeats', 'variable number of tandems repeat', 'variable number of tandems repeatss', 'variable number of tandems repeats', 'variable numbers of tandem repeat', 'variable numbers of tandem repeatss', 'variable numbers of tandem repeats', 'variable numbers of tandems repeat', 'variable numbers of tandems repeatss', 'variable numbers of tandems repeats'), ('model organism', 'model organisms'), ('physical map', 'physical maps'), ('contig', 'contigs'), ('sequence mapping', 'sequence mappings'), ('deoxynucleotide', 'deoxynucleotides'), ('chain termination method', 'chain termination methods', 'chain terminations method', 'chain terminations methods', 'chains termination method', 'chains termination methods', 'chains terminations method', 'chains terminations methods'), ('dideoxynucleotide', 'dideoxynucleotides')]"
88,stax-bio,17,Biotechnology and Genomics,3,m44555,Whole-Genome Sequencing,"although there have been significant advances in the medical sciences in recent years, doctors are still confounded by some diseases, and they are using whole-genome sequencing to get to the bottom of the problem. whole-genome sequencing is a process that determines the dna sequence of an entire genome. whole-genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease. several laboratories now provide services to sequence, analyze, and interpret entire genomes. for example, whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing. in exome sequencing, only the coding, exon-producing regions of the dna are sequenced. in 2010, whole-exome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. the child had several colon operations with no relief. finally, whole-exome sequencing was performed, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death). a bone-marrow transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. he was the first person to be successfully treated based on a diagnosis made by whole-exome sequencing. today, human genome sequencing is more readily available and can be completed in a day or two for about $1000. the basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known as the dideoxy method), which was developed by fred sanger in the 1970s. the chain termination method involves dna replication of a single-stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular deoxynucleotide (dntp), which is a monomer, or a single unit, of dna. the primer and dntp are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotides (ddntps). the ddntps are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (oh) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain ([link]). each ddntp is labeled with a different color of fluorophore. every time a ddntp is incorporated in the growing complementary strand, it terminates the process of dna replication, which results in multiple short strands of replicated dna that are each terminated at a different point during replication. when the reaction mixture is processed by gel electrophoresis after being separated into single strands, the multiple newly replicated dna strands form a ladder because of the differing sizes. because the ddntps are fluorescently labeled, each band on the gel reflects the size of the dna strand and the ddntp that terminated the reaction. the different colors of the fluorophore-labeled ddntps help identify the ddntp incorporated at that position. reading the gel on the basis of the color of each band on the ladder produces the sequence of the template strand ([link]). in shotgun sequencing  method, several copies of a dna fragment are cut randomly into many smaller pieces (somewhat like what happens to a round shot cartridge when fired from a shotgun). all of the segments are then sequenced using the chain-sequencing method. then, with the help of a computer, the fragments are analyzed to see where their sequences overlap. by matching up overlapping sequences at the end of each fragment, the entire dna sequence can be reformed. a  larger sequence that is assembled from overlapping shorter sequences is called a contig. as an analogy, consider that someone has four copies of a landscape photograph that you have never seen before and know nothing about how it should appear. the person then  rips up each photograph with their hands, so that different size pieces are present from each copy. the person then mixes all of the pieces together and asks you to reconstruct the photograph. in one of the smaller pieces you see a mountain. in a larger piece, you see that the same mountain is behind a lake. a third fragment shows only the lake, but it reveals that there is a cabin on the shore of the lake. therefore, from looking at the overlapping information in these three fragments, you know that the picture contains a mountain behind a lake that has a cabin on its shore. this is the principle behind reconstructing entire dna sequences using shotgun sequencing. originally, shotgun sequencing only analyzed one end of each fragment for overlaps. this was sufficient for sequencing small genomes. however, the desire to sequence larger genomes, such as that of a human, led to the development of double-barrel shotgun sequencing, more formally known as pairwise-end sequencing. in pairwise-end sequencing, both ends of each fragment are analyzed for overlap. pairwise-end sequencing is, therefore, more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct the sequence because there is more available information. since 2005, automated sequencing techniques used by laboratories are under the umbrella of next-generation sequencing, which is a group of automated techniques used for rapid dna sequencing. these automated low-cost sequencers can generate sequences of hundreds of thousands or millions of short fragments (25 to 500 base pairs) in the span of one day. these sequencers use sophisticated software to get through the cumbersome process of putting all the fragments in order. comparing sequencesa sequence alignment is an arrangement of proteins, dna, or rna; it is used to identify regions of similarity between cell types or species, which may indicate conservation of function or structures. sequence alignments may be used to construct phylogenetic trees. the following website uses a software program called blast (basic local alignment search tool). under basic blast, click nucleotide blast.  input  the following sequence into the large  ""query sequence"" box: attgcttcgattgca. below the box, locate the ""species"" field and type ""human"" or ""homo sapiens"".  then click blast to
compare the inputted sequence against known sequences of the human genome. the result is that this sequence occurs in over a hundred places in the human genome.  scroll down below the graphic with the horizontal bars and you will see short description of each of the matching hits. pick one of the hits near the top of the list and click on ""graphics"". this will bring you to a page that shows where the sequence is found within the entire human genome. you can move the slider that looks like a green flag back and forth to view the sequences immediately around the selected gene. you can then return to your selected sequence by clicking the ""atg"" button. the first genome to be completely sequenced was of a bacterial virus, the bacteriophage fx174 (5368 base pairs); this was accomplished by fred sanger using shotgun sequencing. several other organelle and viral genomes were later sequenced. the first organism whose genome was sequenced was the bacterium haemophilus influenzae; this was accomplished by craig venter in the 1980s. approximately 74 different laboratories collaborated on the sequencing of the genome of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, which began in 1989 and was completed in 1996, because it was 60 times bigger than any other genome that had been sequenced. by 1997, the genome sequences of two important model organisms were available: the bacterium escherichia coli k12 and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouse mus musculus, the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster, the nematode caenorhabditis. elegans, and humans homo sapiens are now known. a lot of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied to genetically similar organisms. a model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species represented by the model organism. having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms. the process of attaching biological information to gene sequences is called genome annotation. annotation of gene sequences helps with basic experiments in molecular biology, such as designing pcr primers and rna targets. dna microarrays are methods used to detect gene expression by analyzing an array of dna fragments that are fixed to a glass slide or a silicon chip to identify active genes and identify sequences. almost one million genotypic abnormalities can be discovered using microarrays, whereas whole-genome sequencing can provide information about all six billion base pairs in the human genome.  although the study of medical applications of genome sequencing is interesting, this discipline tends to dwell on abnormal gene function. knowledge of the entire genome will allow future onset diseases and other genetic disorders to be discovered early, which will allow for more informed decisions to be made about lifestyle, medication, and having children. genomics is still in its infancy, although someday it may become routine to use whole-genome sequencing to screen every newborn to detect genetic abnormalities. in addition to disease and medicine, genomics can contribute to the development of novel enzymes that convert biomass to biofuel, which results in higher crop and fuel production, and lower cost to the consumer. this knowledge should allow better methods of control over the microbes that are used in the production of biofuels. genomics could also improve the methods used to monitor the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and help clean up environmental contaminants. genomics has allowed for the development of agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals that could benefit medical science and agriculture. it sounds great to have all the knowledge we can get from whole-genome sequencing; however, humans have a responsibility to use this knowledge wisely. otherwise, it could be easy to misuse the power of such knowledge, leading to discrimination based on a person's genetics, human genetic engineering, and other ethical concerns. this information could also lead to legal issues regarding health and privacy. whole-genome sequencing is the latest available resource to treat genetic diseases. some doctors are using whole-genome sequencing to save lives. genomics has many industrial applications including biofuel development, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and pollution control. the basic principle of all modern-day sequencing strategies involves the chain termination method of sequencing. although the human genome sequences provide key insights to medical professionals, researchers use whole-genome sequences of model organisms to better understand the genome of the species. automation and the decreased cost of whole-genome sequencing may lead to personalized medicine in the future.","[('genome annotation', 'genome annotations'), ('genomic', 'genomicss', 'genomics'), ('shotgun sequencing', 'shotgun sequencings'), ('dna microarray', 'dna microarrays'), ('biotechnology', 'biotechnologies'), ('next-generation sequencing', 'next-generation sequencings'), ('model organism', 'model organisms'), ('whole-genome sequencing', 'whole-genome sequencings'), ('contig', 'contigs'), ('deoxynucleotide', 'deoxynucleotides'), ('chain termination method', 'chain termination methods', 'chain terminations method', 'chain terminations methods', 'chains termination method', 'chains termination methods', 'chains terminations method', 'chains terminations methods'), ('dideoxynucleotide', 'dideoxynucleotides')]"
89,stax-bio,17,Biotechnology and Genomics,4,m44560,Applying Genomics,"the introduction of dna sequencing and whole genome sequencing projects, particularly the human genome project, has expanded the applicability of dna sequence information. genomics is now being used in a wide variety of fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial genomics. the most commonly known application of genomics is to understand and find cures for diseases. predicting the risk of disease involves screening currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level. intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs can be recommended before disease onset. however, this approach is most applicable when the problem resides within a single gene defect. such defects only account for approximately 5 percent of diseases in developed countries. most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multi-factored or polygenic, which is a phenotypic characteristic that involves two or more genes, and also involve environmental factors such as diet. in april 2010, scientists at stanford university published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (stephen quake, a scientist at stanford university, who had his genome sequenced); the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. a risk assessment was performed to analyze quakes percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. a rare genetic mutation was found, which showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. he was also predicted to have a 23 percent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing alzheimers. the scientists used databases and several publications to analyze the genomic data. even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools are becoming more reliable, ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level remain to be addressed. pharmacogenomics, also called toxicogenomics, involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an individual's genomic sequence. genomic responses to drugs can be studied using experimental animals (such as laboratory rats or mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. studying changes in gene expression could provide information about the transcription profile in the presence of the drug, which can be used as an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects. for example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to the growth of cancerous cells. genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity. personal genome sequence information can be used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of the individual patients genotype. the gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise. traditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. in addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in isolation. most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. for all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms. metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche. metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment ([link]). knowledge of the genomics of microorganisms is being used to find better ways to harness biofuels from algae and cyanobacteria. the primary sources of fuel today are coal, oil, wood, and other plant products, such as ethanol. although plants are renewable resources, there is still a need to find more alternative renewable sources of energy to meet our populations energy demands. the microbial world is one of the largest resources for genes that encode new enzymes and produce new organic compounds, and it remains largely untapped. microorganisms are used to create products, such as enzymes that are used in research, antibiotics, and other anti-microbial mechanisms. microbial genomics is helping to develop diagnostic tools, improved vaccines, new disease treatments, and advanced environmental cleanup techniques. mitochondria are intracellular organelles that contain their own dna. mitochondrial dna mutates at a rapid rate and is often used to study evolutionary relationships. another feature that makes studying the mitochondrial genome interesting is that the mitochondrial dna in most multicellular organisms is passed on from the mother during the process of fertilization. for this reason, mitochondrial genomics is often used to trace genealogy. information and clues obtained from dna samples found at crime scenes have been used as evidence in court cases, and genetic markers have been used in forensic analysis. genomic analysis has also become useful in this field. in 2001, the first use of genomics in forensics was published. it was a collaborative attempt between academic research institutions and the fbi to solve the mysterious cases of anthrax communicated via the us postal service. using microbial genomics, researchers determined that a specific strain of anthrax was used in all the mailings. genomics can reduce the trials and failures involved in scientific research to a certain extent, which could improve the quality and quantity of crop yields in agriculture. linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities. scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer those traits to a different organism. scientists are discovering how genomics can improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production. for example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season. imagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics. genomics is being applied to most fields of biology; it is being used for personalized medicine, prediction of disease risks at an individual level, the study of drug interactions before the conduct of clinical trials, and the study of microorganisms in the environment as opposed to the laboratory. it is also being applied to developments such as the generation of new biofuels, genealogical assessment using mitochondria, advances in forensic science, and improvements in agriculture.","[('metagenomic', 'metagenomicss', 'metagenomics'), ('genomic', 'genomicss', 'genomics'), ('disease prediction', 'disease predictions'),

90,stax-bio,17,Biotechnology and Genomics,5,m44558,Genomics and Proteomics,"proteins are the final products of genes, which help perform the function encoded by the gene. proteins are composed of amino acids and play important roles in the cell. all enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins that act as catalysts to affect the rate of reactions. proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs. antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. in the diseased state, protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a specific protein. a proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type. proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for mrnas, and the mrnas encode proteins. although mrna analysis is a step in the right direction, not all mrnas are translated into proteins. the study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics. proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes. even though all cells of a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression. thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism. in addition, rnas can be alternately spliced (cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins) and many proteins are modified after translation by processes such as proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination. there are also protein-protein interactions, which complicate the study of proteomes. although the genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends on several factors that can change the progression of events that generate the proteome. metabolomics is related to genomics and proteomics. metabolomics involves the study of small molecule metabolites found in an organism. the metabolome is the complete set of metabolites that are related to the genetic makeup of an organism. metabolomics offers an opportunity to compare genetic makeup and physical characteristics, as well as genetic makeup and environmental factors. the goal of metabolome research is to identify, quantify, and catalogue all of the metabolites that are found in the tissues and fluids of living organisms. the ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify or compare the proteins expressed from a given genome under specific conditions, study the interactions between the proteins, and use the information to predict cell behavior or develop drug targets. just as the genome is analyzed using the basic technique of dna sequencing, proteomics requires techniques for protein analysis. the basic technique for protein analysis, analogous to dna sequencing, is mass spectrometry. mass spectrometry is used to identify and determine the characteristics of a molecule. advances in spectrometry have allowed researchers to analyze very small samples of protein. x-ray crystallography, for example, enables scientists to determine the three-dimensional structure of a protein crystal at atomic resolution. another protein imaging technique, nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr), uses the magnetic properties of atoms to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins in aqueous solution. protein microarrays have also been used to study interactions between proteins. large-scale adaptations of the basic two-hybrid screen ([link]) have provided the basis for protein microarrays. computer software is used to analyze the vast amount of data generated for proteomic analysis. genomic- and proteomic-scale analyses are part of systems biology. systems biology is the study of whole biological systems (genomes and proteomes) based on interactions within the system. the european bioinformatics institute and the human proteome organization (hupo) are developing and establishing effective tools to sort through the enormous pile of systems biology data. because proteins are the direct products of genes and reflect activity at the genomic level, it is natural to use proteomes to compare the protein profiles of different cells to identify proteins and genes involved in disease processes. most pharmaceutical drug trials target proteins. information obtained from proteomics is being used to identify novel drugs and understand their mechanisms of action. the challenge of techniques used for proteomic analyses is the difficulty in detecting small quantities of proteins. although mass spectrometry is good for detecting small amounts of proteins, variations in protein expression in diseased states can be difficult to discern. proteins are naturally unstable molecules, which makes proteomic analysis much more difficult than genomic analysis. genomes and proteomes of patients suffering from specific diseases are being studied to understand the genetic basis of the disease. the most prominent disease being studied with proteomic approaches is cancer. proteomic approaches are being used to improve screening and early detection of cancer; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process. an individual protein is called a biomarker, whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature. for a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer, it must be secreted in body fluids, such as sweat, blood, or urine, such that large-scale screenings can be performed in a non-invasive fashion. the current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false-negative results. a false negative is an incorrect test result that should have been positive. in other words, many cases of cancer go undetected, which makes biomarkers unreliable. some examples of protein biomarkers used in cancer detection are ca-125 for ovarian cancer and psa for prostate cancer. protein signatures may be more reliable than biomarkers to detect cancer cells. proteomics is also being used to develop individualized treatment plans, which involves the prediction of whether or not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the side effects that the individual may experience. proteomics is also being used to predict the possibility of disease recurrence. the national cancer institute has developed programs to improve the detection and treatment of cancer. the clinical proteomic technologies for cancer and the early detection research network are efforts to identify protein signatures specific to different types of cancers. the biomedical proteomics program is designed to identify protein signatures and design effective therapies for cancer patients. proteomics is the study of the entire set of proteins expressed by a given type of cell under certain environmental conditions. in a multicellular organism, different cell types will have different proteomes, and these will vary with changes in the environment. unlike a genome, a proteome is dynamic and in constant flux, which makes it both more complicated and more useful than the knowledge of genomes alone. proteomics approaches rely on protein analysis; these techniques are constantly being upgraded. proteomics has been used to study different types of cancer. different biomarkers and protein signatures are being used to analyze each type of cancer. the future goal is to have a personalized treatment plan for each individual.","[('protein signature', 'protein signatures'), ('genomic', 'genomicss', 'genomics'),

92,stax-bio,18,Evolution and the Origin of Species,1,m44568,Understanding Evolution,"evolution by natural selection describes a mechanism for how species change over time. that species change had been suggested and debated well before darwin began to explore this idea. the view that species were static and unchanging was grounded in the writings of plato, yet there were also ancient greeks who expressed evolutionary ideas. in the eighteenth century, ideas about the evolution of animals were reintroduced by the naturalist georges-louis leclerc comte de buffon who observed that various geographic regions have different plant and animal populations, even when the environments are similar. it was also accepted that there were extinct species. during this time, james hutton, a scottish naturalist, proposed that geological change occurred gradually by the accumulation of small changes from processes operating like they are today over long periods of time. this contrasted with the predominant view that the geology of the planet was a consequence of catastrophic events occurring during a relatively brief past. huttons view was popularized in the nineteenth century by the geologist charles lyell who became a friend to darwin. lyells ideas were influential on darwins thinking: lyells notion of the greater age of earth gave more time for gradual change in species, and the process of change provided an analogy for gradual change in species. in the early nineteenth century, jean-baptiste lamarck published a book that detailed a mechanism for evolutionary change. this mechanism is now referred to as an inheritance of acquired characteristics by which modifications in an individual are caused by its environment, or the use or disuse of a structure during its lifetime, could be inherited by its offspring and thus bring about change in a species. while this mechanism for evolutionary change was discredited, lamarcks ideas were an important influence on evolutionary thought. in the mid-nineteenth century, the actual mechanism for evolution was independently conceived of and described by two naturalists: charles darwin and alfred russel wallace. importantly, each naturalist spent time exploring the natural world on expeditions to the tropics. from 1831 to 1836, darwin traveled around the world on h.m.s. beagle, including stops in south america, australia, and the southern tip of africa. wallace traveled to brazil to collect insects in the amazon rainforest from 1848 to 1852 and to the malay archipelago from 1854 to 1862. darwins journey, like wallaces later journeys to the malay archipelago, included stops at several island chains, the last being the galpagos islands west of ecuador. on these islands, darwin observed species of organisms on different islands that were clearly similar, yet had distinct differences. for example, the ground finches inhabiting the galpagos islands comprised several species with a unique beak shape ([link]). the species on the islands had a graded series of beak sizes and shapes with very small differences between the most similar. he observed that these finches closely resembled another finch species on the mainland of south america. darwin imagined that the island species might be species modified from one of the original mainland species. upon further study, he realized that the varied beaks of each finch helped the birds acquire a specific type of food. for example, seed-eating finches had stronger, thicker beaks for breaking seeds, and insect-eating finches had spear-like beaks for stabbing their prey. wallace and darwin both observed similar patterns in other organisms and they independently developed the same explanation for how and why such changes could take place. darwin called this mechanism natural selection. natural selection, also known as survival of the fittest, is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits; this leads to evolutionary change. for example, a population of giant tortoises found in the galapagos archipelago was observed by darwin to have longer necks than those that lived on other islands with dry lowlands. these tortoises were selected because they could reach more leaves and access more food than those with short necks. in times of drought when fewer leaves would be available, those that could reach more leaves had a better chance to eat and survive than those that couldnt reach the food source. consequently, long-necked tortoises would be more likely to be reproductively successful and pass the long-necked trait to their offspring. over time, only long-necked tortoises would be present in the population. natural selection, darwin argued, was an inevitable outcome of three principles that operated in nature. first, most characteristics of organisms are inherited, or passed from parent to offspring. although no one, including darwin and wallace, knew how this happened at the time, it was a common understanding. second, more offspring are produced than are able to survive, so resources for survival and reproduction are limited. the capacity for reproduction in all organisms outstrips the availability of resources to support their numbers. thus, there is competition for those resources in each generation. both darwin and wallaces understanding of this principle came from reading an essay by the economist thomas malthus who discussed this principle in relation to human populations. third, offspring vary among each other in regard to their characteristics and those variations are inherited. darwin and wallace reasoned that offspring with inherited characteristics which allow them to best compete for limited resources will survive and have more offspring than those individuals with variations that are less able to compete. because characteristics are inherited, these traits will be better represented in the next generation. this will lead to change in populations over generations in a process that darwin called descent with modification. ultimately, natural selection leads to greater adaptation of the population to its local environment; it is the only mechanism known for adaptive evolution. papers by darwin and wallace ([link]) presenting the idea of natural selection were read together in 1858 before the linnean society in london. the following year darwins book, on the origin of species, was published. his book outlined in considerable detail his arguments for evolution by natural selection. demonstrations of evolution by natural selection are time consuming and difficult to obtain. one of the best examples has been demonstrated in the very birds that helped to inspire darwins theory: the galpagos finches. peter and rosemary grant and their colleagues have studied galpagos finch populations every year since 1976 and have provided important demonstrations of natural selection. the grants found changes from one generation to the next in the distribution of beak shapes with the medium ground finch on the galpagos island of daphne major. the birds have inherited variation in the bill shape with some birds having wide deep bills and others having thinner bills. during a period in which rainfall was higher than normal because of an el nio, the large hard seeds that large-billed birds ate were reduced in number; however, there was an abundance of the small soft seeds which the small-billed birds ate. therefore, survival and reproduction were much better in the following years for the small-billed birds. in the years following this el nio, the grants measured beak sizes in the population and found that the average bill size was smaller. since bill size is an inherited trait, parents with smaller bills had more offspring and the size of bills had evolved to be smaller. as conditions improved in 1987 and larger seeds became more available, the trend toward smaller average bill size ceased. field biologistmany people hike, explore caves, scuba dive, or climb mountains for recreation. people often participate in these activities hoping to see wildlife. experiencing the outdoors can be incredibly enjoyable and invigorating. what if your job was to be outside in the wilderness? field biologists by definition work outdoors in the field. the term field in this case refers to any location outdoors, even under water. a field biologist typically focuses research on a certain species, group of organisms, or a single habitat ([link]). one objective of many field biologists includes discovering new species that have never been recorded. not only do such findings expand our understanding of the natural world, but they also lead to important innovations in fields such as medicine and agriculture. plant and microbial species, in particular, can reveal new medicinal and nutritive knowledge. other organisms can play key roles in ecosystems or be considered rare and in need of protection. when discovered, these important species can be used as evidence for environmental regulations and laws. natural selection can only take place if there is variation, or differences, among individuals in a population. importantly, these differences must have some genetic basis; otherwise, the selection will not lead to change in the next generation. this is critical because variation among individuals can be caused by non-genetic reasons such as an individual being taller because of better nutrition rather than different genes. genetic diversity in a population comes from two main mechanisms: mutation and sexual reproduction. mutation, a change in dna, is the ultimate source of new alleles, or new genetic variation in any population. the genetic changes caused by mutation can have one of three outcomes on the phenotype. a mutation affects the phenotype of the organism in a way that gives it reduced fitnesslower likelihood of survival or fewer offspring. a mutation may produce a phenotype with a beneficial effect on fitness. and, many mutations will also have no effect on the fitness of the phenotype; these are called neutral mutations. mutations may also have a whole range of effect sizes on the fitness of the organism that expresses them in their phenotype, from a small effect to a great effect. sexual reproduction also leads to genetic diversity: when two parents reproduce, unique combinations of alleles assemble to produce the unique genotypes and thus phenotypes in each of the offspring. a heritable trait that helps the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation. scientists describe groups of organisms becoming adapted to their environment when a change in the range of genetic variation occurs over time that increases or maintains the fit of the population to its environment. the webbed feet of platypuses are an adaptation for swimming. the snow leopards thick fur is an adaptation for living in the cold. the cheetahs fast speed is an adaptation for catching prey. whether or not a trait is favorable depends on the environmental conditions at the time. the same traits are not always selected because environmental conditions can change. for example, consider a species of plant that grew in a moist climate and did not need to conserve water. large leaves were selected because they allowed the plant to obtain more energy from the sun. large leaves require more water to maintain than small leaves, and the moist environment provided favorable conditions to support large leaves. after thousands of years, the climate changed, and the area no longer had excess water. the direction of natural selection shifted so that plants with small leaves were selected because those populations were able to conserve water to survive the new environmental conditions. the evolution of species has resulted in enormous variation in form and function. sometimes, evolution gives rise to groups of organisms that become tremendously different from each other. when two species evolve in diverse directions from a common point, it is called divergent evolution. such divergent evolution can be seen in the forms of the reproductive organs of flowering plants which share the same basic anatomies; however, they can look very different as a result of selection in different physical environments and adaptation to different kinds of pollinators ([link]). in other cases, similar phenotypes evolve independently in distantly related species. for example, flight has evolved in both bats and insects, and they both have structures we refer to as wings, which are adaptations to flight. however, the wings of bats and insects have evolved from very different original structures. this phenomenon is called convergent evolution , where similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a common ancestry. the two species came to the same function, flying, but did so separately from each other. these physical changes occur over enormous spans of time and help explain how evolution occurs. natural selection acts on individual organisms, which in turn can shape an entire species. although natural selection may work in a single generation on an individual, it can take thousands or even millions of years for the genotype of an entire species to evolve. it is over these large time spans that life on earth has changed and continues to change. the evidence for evolution is compelling and extensive. looking at every level of organization in living systems, biologists see the signature of past and present evolution. darwin dedicated a large portion of his book, on the origin of species, to identifying patterns in nature that were consistent with evolution, and since darwin, our understanding has become clearer and broader. fossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those found today, and fossils show a progression of evolution. scientists determine the age of fossils and categorize them from all over the world to determine when the organisms lived relative to each other. the resulting fossil record tells the story of the past and shows the evolution of form over millions of years ([link]). for example, scientists have recovered highly detailed records showing the evolution of humans and horses ([link]). the whale flipper shares a similar morphology to appendages of birds and mammals ([link]) indicating that these species share a common ancestor. another type of evidence for evolution is the presence of structures in organisms that share the same basic form. for example, the bones in the appendages of a human, dog, bird, and whale all share the same overall construction ([link]) resulting from their origin in the appendages of a common ancestor. over time, evolution led to changes in the shapes and sizes of these bones in different species, but they have maintained the same overall layout. scientists call these synonymous parts homologous structures. some structures exist in organisms that have no apparent function at all, and appear to be residual parts from a past common ancestor. these unused structures without function are called vestigial structures. other examples of vestigial structures are wings on flightless birds, leaves on some cacti, and hind leg bones in whales. another evidence of evolution is the convergence of form in organisms that share similar environments. for example, species of unrelated animals, such as the arctic fox and ptarmigan, living in the arctic region have been selected for seasonal white phenotypes during winter to blend with the snow and ice ([link]ab). these similarities occur not because of common ancestry, but because of similar selection pressuresthe benefits of not being seen by predators. embryology, the study of the development of the anatomy of an organism to its adult form, also provides evidence of relatedness between now widely divergent groups of organisms. mutational tweaking in the embryo can have such magnified consequences in the adult that embryo formation tends to be conserved. as a result, structures that are absent in some groups often appear in their embryonic forms and disappear by the time the adult or juvenile form is reached. for example, all vertebrate embryos, including humans, exhibit gill slits and tails at some point in their early development. these disappear in the adults of terrestrial groups but are maintained in adult forms of aquatic groups such as fish and some amphibians. great ape embryos, including humans, have a tail structure during their development that is lost by the time of birth. the geographic distribution of organisms on the planet follows patterns that are best explained by evolution in conjunction with the movement of tectonic plates over geological time. broad groups that evolved before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea (about 200 million years ago) are distributed worldwide. groups that evolved since the breakup appear uniquely in regions of the planet, such as the unique flora and fauna of northern continents that formed from the supercontinent laurasia and of the southern continents that formed from the supercontinent gondwana. the presence of members of the plant family proteaceae in australia, southern africa, and south america is best by their presence prior to the southern supercontinent gondwana breaking up. the great diversification of marsupials in australia and the absence of other mammals reflect australias long isolation. australia has an abundance of endemic speciesspecies found nowhere elsewhich is typical of islands whose isolation by expanses of water prevents species to migrate. over time, these species diverge evolutionarily into new species that look very different from their ancestors that may exist on the mainland. the marsupials of australia, the finches on the galpagos, and many species on the hawaiian islands are all unique to their one point of origin, yet they display distant relationships to ancestral species on mainlands. like anatomical structures, the structures of the molecules of life reflect descent with modification. evidence of a common ancestor for all of life is reflected in the universality of dna as the genetic material and in the near universality of the genetic code and the machinery of dna replication and expression. fundamental divisions in life between the three domains are reflected in major structural differences in otherwise conservative structures such as the components of ribosomes and the structures of membranes. in general, the relatedness of groups of organisms is reflected in the similarity of their dna sequencesexactly the pattern that would be expected from descent and diversification from a common ancestor. dna sequences have also shed light on some of the mechanisms of evolution. for example, it is clear that the evolution of new functions for proteins commonly occurs after gene duplication events that allow the free modification of one copy by mutation, selection, or drift (changes in a populations gene pool resulting from chance), while the second copy continues to produce a functional protein. although the theory of evolution generated some controversy when it was first proposed, it was almost universally accepted by biologists, particularly younger biologists, within 20 years after publication of on the origin of species. nevertheless, the theory of evolution is a difficult concept and misconceptions about how it works abound. critics of the theory of evolution dismiss its importance by purposefully confounding the everyday usage of the word theory with the way scientists use the word. in science, a theory is understood to be a body of thoroughly tested and verified explanations for a set of observations of the natural world. scientists have a theory of the atom, a theory of gravity, and the theory of relativity, each of which describes understood facts about the world. in the same way, the theory of evolution describes facts about the living world. as such, a theory in science has survived significant efforts to discredit it by scientists. in contrast, a theory in common vernacular is a word meaning a guess or suggested explanation; this meaning is more akin to the scientific concept of hypothesis. when critics of evolution say evolution is just a theory, they are implying that there is little evidence supporting it and that it is still in the process of being rigorously tested. this is a mischaracterization. evolution is the change in genetic composition of a population over time, specifically over generations, resulting from differential reproduction of individuals with certain alleles. individuals do change over their lifetime, obviously, but this is called development and involves changes programmed by the set of genes the individual acquired at birth in coordination with the individuals environment. when thinking about the evolution of a characteristic, it is probably best to think about the change of the average value of the characteristic in the population over time. for example, when natural selection leads to bill-size change in medium-ground finches in the galpagos, this does not mean that individual bills on the finches are changing. if one measures the average bill size among all individuals in the population at one time and then measures the average bill size in the population several years later, this average value will be different as a result of evolution. although some individuals may survive from the first time to the second, they will still have the same bill size; however, there will be many new individuals that contribute to the shift in average bill size. it is a common misunderstanding that evolution includes an explanation of lifes origins. conversely, some of the theorys critics believe that it cannot explain the origin of life. the theory does not try to explain the origin of life. the theory of evolution explains how populations change over time and how life diversifies the origin of species. it does not shed light on the beginnings of life including the origins of the first cells, which is how life is defined. the mechanisms of the origin of life on earth are a particularly difficult problem because it occurred a very long time ago, and presumably it just occurred once. importantly, biologists believe that the presence of life on earth precludes the possibility that the events that led to life on earth can be repeated because the intermediate stages would immediately become food for existing living things. however, once a mechanism of inheritance was in place in the form of a molecule like dna either within a cell or pre-cell, these entities would be subject to the principle of natural selection. more effective reproducers would increase in frequency at the expense of inefficient reproducers. so while evolution does not explain the origin of life, it may have something to say about some of the processes operating once pre-living entities acquired certain properties. statements such as organisms evolve in response to a change in an environment are quite common, but such statements can lead to two types of misunderstandings. first, the statement must not be understood to mean that individual organisms evolve. the statement is shorthand for a population evolves in response to a changing environment. however, a second misunderstanding may arise by interpreting the statement to mean that the evolution is somehow intentional. a changed environment results in some individuals in the population, those with particular phenotypes, benefiting and therefore producing proportionately more offspring than other phenotypes. this results in change in the population if the characteristics are genetically determined. it is also important to understand that the variation that natural selection works on is already in a population and does not arise in response to an environmental change. for example, applying antibiotics to a population of bacteria will, over time, select a population of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. the resistance, which is caused by a gene, did not arise by mutation because of the application of the antibiotic. the gene for resistance was already present in the gene pool of the bacteria, likely at a low frequency. the antibiotic, which kills the bacterial cells without the resistance gene, strongly selects individuals that are resistant, since these would be the only ones that survived and divided. experiments have demonstrated that mutations for antibiotic resistance do not arise as a result of antibiotic. in a larger sense, evolution is not goal directed. species do not become better over time; they simply track their changing environment with adaptations that maximize their reproduction in a particular environment at a particular time. evolution has no goal of making faster, bigger, more complex, or even smarter species, despite the commonness of this kind of language in popular discourse. what characteristics evolve in a species are a function of the variation present and the environment, both of which are constantly changing in a non-directional way. what trait is fit in one environment at one time may well be fatal at some point in the future. this holds equally well for a species of insect as it does the human species. evolution is the process of adaptation through mutation which allows more desirable characteristics to be passed to the next generation. over time, organisms evolve more characteristics that are beneficial to their survival. for living organisms to adapt and change to environmental pressures, genetic variation must be present. with genetic variation, individuals have differences in form and function that allow some to survive certain conditions better than others. these organisms pass their favorable traits to their offspring. eventually, environments change, and what was once a desirable, advantageous trait may become an undesirable trait and organisms may further evolve. evolution may be convergent with similar traits evolving in multiple species or divergent with diverse traits evolving in multiple species that came from a common ancestor. evidence of evolution can be observed by means of dna code and the fossil record, and also by the existence of homologous and vestigial structures.","[('evolution evidence', 'evolution evidences'), ('evolutionary thought', 'evolutionary thoughts'), ('charle darwin', 'charle darwins'),

93,stax-bio,18,Evolution and the Origin of Species,2,m44574,Formation of New Species,"although all life on earth shares various genetic similarities, only certain organisms combine genetic information by sexual reproduction and have offspring that can then successfully reproduce. scientists call such organisms members of the same biological species. a species is a group of individual organisms that interbreed and produce fertile, viable offspring. according to this definition, one species is distinguished from another when, in nature, it is not possible for matings between individuals from each species to produce fertile offspring. members of the same species share both external and internal characteristics, which develop from their dna. the closer relationship two organisms share, the more dna they have in common, just like people and their families. peoples dna is likely to be more like their father or mothers dna than their cousin or grandparents dna. organisms of the same species have the highest level of dna alignment and therefore share characteristics and behaviors that lead to successful reproduction. species appearance can be misleading in suggesting an ability or inability to mate. for example, even though domestic dogs (canis lupus familiaris) display phenotypic differences, such as size, build, and coat, most dogs can interbreed and produce viable puppies that can mature and sexually reproduce ([link]). in other cases, individuals may appear similar although they are not members of the same species. for example, even though bald eagles (haliaeetus leucocephalus) and african fish eagles (haliaeetus vocifer) are both birds and eagles, each belongs to a separate species group ([link]). if humans were to artificially intervene and fertilize the egg of a bald eagle with the sperm of an african fish eagle and a chick did hatch, that offspring, called a hybrid (a cross between two species), would probably be infertileunable to successfully reproduce after it reached maturity. different species may have different genes that are active in development; therefore, it may not be possible to develop a viable offspring with two different sets of directions. thus, even though hybridization may take place, the two species still remain separate. populations of species share a gene pool: a collection of all the variants of genes in the species. again, the basis to any changes in a group or population of organisms must be genetic for this is the only way to share and pass on traits. when variations occur within a species, they can only be passed to the next generation along two main pathways: asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction. the change will be passed on asexually simply if the reproducing cell possesses the changed trait. for the changed trait to be passed on by sexual reproduction, a gamete, such as a sperm or egg cell, must possess the changed trait.  in other words, sexually-reproducing organisms can experience several genetic changes in their body cells, but if these changes do not occur in a sperm or egg cell, the changed trait will never reach the next generation. only heritable traits can evolve. therefore, reproduction plays a paramount role for genetic change to take root in a population or species. in short, organisms must be able to reproduce with each other to pass new traits to offspring. the biological definition of species, which works for sexually reproducing organisms, is a group of actually or potentially interbreeding individuals. there are exceptions to this rule. many species are similar enough that hybrid offspring are possible and may often occur in nature, but for the majority of species this rule generally holds. in fact, the presence in nature of hybrids between similar species suggests that they may have descended from a single interbreeding species, and the speciation process may not yet be completed. given the extraordinary diversity of life on the planet there must be mechanisms for speciation: the formation of two species from one original species. darwin envisioned this process as a branching event and diagrammed the process in the only illustration found in on the origin of species ([link]a). compare this illustration to the diagram of elephant evolution ([link]b), which shows that as one species changes over time, it branches to form more than one new species, repeatedly, as long as the population survives or until the organism becomes extinct. for speciation to occur, two new populations must be formed from one original population and they must evolve in such a way that it becomes impossible for individuals from the two new populations to interbreed. biologists have proposed mechanisms by which this could occur that fall into two broad categories. allopatric speciation (allo- = ""other""; -patric = ""homeland"") involves geographic separation of populations from a parent species and subsequent evolution. sympatric speciation (sym- = ""same""; -patric = ""homeland"") involves speciation occurring within a parent species remaining in one location. biologists think of speciation events as the splitting of one ancestral species into two descendant species. there is no reason why there might not be more than two species formed at one time except that it is less likely and multiple events can be conceptualized as single splits occurring close in time. a geographically continuous population has a gene pool that is relatively homogeneous. gene flow, the movement of alleles across the range of the species, is relatively free because individuals can move and then mate with individuals in their new location. thus, the frequency of an allele at one end of a distribution will be similar to the frequency of the allele at the other end. when populations become geographically discontinuous, that free-flow of alleles is prevented. when that separation lasts for a period of time, the two populations are able to evolve along different trajectories. thus, their allele frequencies at numerous genetic loci gradually become more and more different as new alleles independently arise by mutation in each population. typically, environmental conditions, such as climate, resources, predators, and competitors for the two populations will differ causing natural selection to favor divergent adaptations in each group. isolation of populations leading to allopatric speciation can occur in a variety of ways: a river forming a new branch, erosion forming a new valley, a group of organisms traveling to a new location without the ability to return, or seeds floating over the ocean to an island. the nature of the geographic separation necessary to isolate populations depends entirely on the biology of the organism and its potential for dispersal. if two flying insect populations took up residence in separate nearby valleys, chances are, individuals from each population would fly back and forth continuing gene flow. however, if two rodent populations became divided by the formation of a new lake, continued gene flow would be unlikely; therefore, speciation would be more likely. biologists group allopatric processes into two categories: dispersal and vicariance. dispersal is when a few members of a species move to a new geographical area, and vicariance is when a natural situation arises to physically divide organisms. scientists have documented numerous cases of allopatric speciation taking place. for example, along the west coast of the united states, two separate sub-species of spotted owls exist. the northern spotted owl has genetic and phenotypic differences from its close relative: the mexican spotted owl, which lives in the south ([link]). additionally, scientists have found that the further the distance between two groups that once were the same species, the more likely it is that speciation will occur. this seems logical because as the distance increases, the various environmental factors would likely have less in common than locations in close proximity. consider the two owls: in the north, the climate is cooler than in the south; the types of organisms in each ecosystem differ, as do their behaviors and habits; also, the hunting habits and prey choices of the southern owls vary from the northern owls. these variances can lead to evolved differences in the owls, and speciation likely will occur. in some cases, a population of one species disperses throughout an area, and each finds a distinct niche or isolated habitat. over time, the varied demands of their new lifestyles lead to multiple speciation events originating from a single species. this is called adaptive radiation because many adaptations evolve from a single point of origin; thus, causing the species to radiate into several new ones. island archipelagos like the hawaiian islands provide an ideal context for adaptive radiation events because water surrounds each island which leads to geographical isolation for many organisms. the hawaiian honeycreeper illustrates one example of adaptive radiation. from a single species, called the founder species, numerous species have evolved, including the six shown in [link]. notice the differences in the species beaks in [link]. evolution in response to natural selection based on specific food sources in each new habitat led to evolution of a different beak suited to the specific food source. the seed-eating bird has a thicker, stronger beak which is suited to break hard nuts. the nectar-eating birds have long beaks to dip into flowers to reach the nectar. the insect-eating birds have beaks like swords, appropriate for stabbing and impaling insects. darwins finches are another example of adaptive radiation in an archipelago. can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same habitat? the answer is yes. the process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the prefix sym means same, so sympatric means same homeland in contrast to allopatric meaning other homeland. a number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied. one form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. in a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. however, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition called aneuploidy ([link]). polyploidy is a condition in which a cell or organism has an extra set, or sets, of chromosomes. scientists have identified two main types of polyploidy that can lead to reproductive isolation of an individual in the polyploidy state. reproductive isolation is the inability to interbreed. in some cases, a polyploid individual will have two or more complete sets of chromosomes from its own species in a condition called autopolyploidy ([link]). the prefix auto- means self, so the term means multiple chromosomes from ones own species. polyploidy results from an error in meiosis in which all of the chromosomes move into one cell instead of separating. for example, if a plant species with 2n = 6 produces autopolyploid gametes that are also diploid (2n = 6, when they should be n = 3), the gametes now have twice as many chromosomes as they should have. these new gametes will be incompatible with the normal gametes produced by this plant species. however, they could either self-pollinate or reproduce with other autopolyploid plants with gametes having the same diploid number. in this way, sympatric speciation can occur quickly by forming offspring with 4n called a tetraploid. these individuals would immediately be able to reproduce only with those of this new kind and not those of the ancestral species. the other form of polyploidy occurs when individuals of two different species reproduce to form a viable offspring called an allopolyploid. the prefix allo- means other (recall from allopatric): therefore, an allopolyploid occurs when gametes from two different species combine. [link] illustrates one possible way an allopolyploid can form. notice how it takes two generations, or two reproductive acts, before the viable fertile hybrid results. the cultivated forms of wheat, cotton, and tobacco plants are all allopolyploids. although polyploidy occurs occasionally in animals, it takes place most commonly in plants. (animals with any of the types of chromosomal aberrations described here are unlikely to survive and produce normal offspring.) scientists have discovered more than half of all plant species studied relate back to a species evolved through polyploidy. with such a high rate of polyploidy in plants, some scientists hypothesize that this mechanism takes place more as an adaptation than as an error. given enough time, the genetic and phenotypic divergence between populations will affect characters that influence reproduction: if individuals of the two populations were to be brought together, mating would be less likely, but if mating occurred, offspring would be non-viable or infertile. many types of diverging characters may affect the reproductive isolation, the ability to interbreed, of the two populations. reproductive isolation can take place in a variety of ways. scientists organize them into two groups: prezygotic barriers and postzygotic barriers. recall that a zygote is a fertilized egg: the first cell of the development of an organism that reproduces sexually. therefore, a prezygotic barrier is a mechanism that blocks reproduction from taking place; this includes barriers that prevent fertilization when organisms attempt reproduction. a postzygotic barrier occurs after zygote formation; this includes organisms that dont survive the embryonic stage and those that are born sterile. some types of prezygotic barriers prevent reproduction entirely. many organisms only reproduce at certain times of the year, often just annually. differences in breeding schedules, called temporal isolation, can act as a form of reproductive isolation. for example, two species of frogs inhabit the same area, but one reproduces from january to march, whereas the other reproduces from march to may ([link]). in some cases, populations of a species move or are moved to a new habitat and take up residence in a place that no longer overlaps with the other populations of the same species. this situation is called habitat isolation. reproduction with the parent species ceases, and a new group exists that is now reproductively and genetically independent. for example, a cricket population that was divided after a flood could no longer interact with each other. over time, the forces of natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift will likely result in the divergence of the two groups ([link]). behavioral isolation occurs when the presence or absence of a specific behavior prevents reproduction from taking place. for example, male fireflies use specific light patterns to attract females. various species of fireflies display their lights differently. if a male of one species tried to attract the female of another, she would not recognize the light pattern and would not mate with the male. other prezygotic barriers work when differences in their gamete cells (eggs and sperm) prevent fertilization from taking place; this is called a gametic barrier. similarly, in some cases closely related organisms try to mate, but their reproductive structures simply do not fit together. for example, damselfly males of different species have differently shaped reproductive organs. if one species tries to mate with the female of another, their body parts simply do not fit together. ([link]). in plants, certain structures aimed to attract one type of pollinator simultaneously prevent a different pollinator from accessing the pollen. the tunnel through which an animal must access nectar can vary widely in length and diameter, which prevents the plant from being cross-pollinated with a different species ([link]). when fertilization takes place and a zygote forms, postzygotic barriers can prevent reproduction. hybrid individuals in many cases cannot form normally in the womb and simply do not survive past the embryonic stages. this is called hybrid inviability because the hybrid organisms simply are not viable. in another postzygotic situation, reproduction leads to the birth and growth of a hybrid that is sterile and unable to reproduce offspring of their own; this is called hybrid sterility. sympatric speciation may also take place in ways other than polyploidy. for example, consider a species of fish that lives in a lake. as the population grows, competition for food also grows. under pressure to find food, suppose that a group of these fish had the genetic flexibility to discover and feed off another resource that was unused by the other fish. what if this new food source was found at a different depth of the lake? over time, those feeding on the second food source would interact more with each other than the other fish; therefore, they would breed together as well. offspring of these fish would likely behave as their parents: feeding and living in the same area and keeping separate from the original population. if this group of fish continued to remain separate from the first population, eventually sympatric speciation might occur as more genetic differences accumulated between them. this scenario does play out in nature, as do others that lead to reproductive isolation. one such place is lake victoria in africa, famous for its sympatric speciation of cichlid fish. researchers have found hundreds of sympatric speciation events in these fish, which have not only happened in great number, but also over a short period of time. [link] shows this type of speciation among a cichlid fish population in nicaragua. in this locale, two types of cichlids live in the same geographic location but have come to have different morphologies that allow them to eat various food sources. speciation occurs along two main pathways: geographic separation (allopatric speciation) and through mechanisms that occur within a shared habitat (sympatric speciation). both pathways isolate a population reproductively in some form. mechanisms of reproductive isolation act as barriers between closely related species, enabling them to diverge and exist as genetically independent species. prezygotic barriers block reproduction prior to formation of a zygote, whereas postzygotic barriers block reproduction after fertilization occurs. for a new species to develop, something must cause a breach in the reproductive barriers. sympatric speciation can occur through errors in meiosis that form gametes with extra chromosomes (polyploidy). autopolyploidy occurs within a single species, whereas allopolyploidy occurs between closely related species.","[('vicariance', 'vicariances'), ('allopolyploidy', 'allopolyploidies'), ('reproduction', 'reproductions'), ('behavioral isolation', 'behavioral isolations'), ('aneuploidy', 'aneuploidies'), ('postzygotic barrier', 'postzygotic barriers'), ('evolution', 'evolutions'), ('origin of specy', 'origin of species', 'origin of species', 'origins of specy', 'origins of species', 'origins of species'), ('temporal isolation', 'temporal isolations'), ('hybrid viability', 'hybrid viabilities'), ('sympatric speciation', 'sympatric speciations'), ('reproductive barrier', 'reproductive barriers'), ('hybrid', 'hybrids'), ('speciation', 'speciations'), ('gametic barrier', 'gametic barriers'), ('reproductive isolation', 'reproductive isolations'), ('biological species concept', 'biological species concepts', 'biological species concept', 'biological species concepts'), ('dispersal', 'dispersals'), ('prezygotic barrier', 'prezygotic barriers'), ('autopolyploidy', 'autopolyploidies'), ('chromosomal sympatric speciation', 'chromosomal sympatric speciations'), ('species', 'species'), ('allopatric speciation', 'allopatric speciations'), ('hybrid sterility', 'hybrid sterilities'), ('habitat isolation', 'habitat isolations'), ('evolving new specy', 'evolving new species'), ('field biologist', 'field biologists'), ('adaptive radiation', 'adaptive radiations')]"
94,stax-bio,18,Evolution and the Origin of Species,3,m44573,Reconnection and Rates of Speciation,"speciation occurs over a span of evolutionary time, so when a new species arises, there is a transition period during which the closely related species continue to interact. after speciation, two species may recombine or even continue interacting indefinitely. individual organisms will mate with any nearby individual who they are capable of breeding with. an area where two closely related species continue to interact and reproduce, forming hybrids, is called a hybrid zone. over time, the hybrid zone may change depending on the fitness of the hybrids and the reproductive barriers ([link]). if the hybrids are less fit than the parents, reinforcement of speciation occurs, and the species continue to diverge until they can no longer mate and produce viable offspring. if reproductive barriers weaken, fusion occurs and the two species become one. barriers remain the same if hybrids are fit and reproductive: stability may occur and hybridization continues. hybrids can be either less fit than the parents, more fit, or about the same. usually hybrids tend to be less fit; therefore, such reproduction diminishes over time, nudging the two species to diverge further in a process called reinforcement. this term is used because the low success of the hybrids reinforces the original speciation. if the hybrids are as fit or more fit than the parents, the two species may fuse back into one species ([link]). scientists have also observed that sometimes two species will remain separate but also continue to interact to produce some hybrid individuals; this is classified as stability because no real net change is taking place. scientists around the world study speciation, documenting observations both of living organisms and those found in the fossil record. as their ideas take shape and as research reveals new details about how life evolves, they develop models to help explain rates of speciation. in terms of how quickly speciation occurs, two patterns are currently observed: gradual speciation model and punctuated equilibrium model. in the gradual speciation model, species diverge gradually over time in small steps. in the punctuated equilibrium model, a new species undergoes changes quickly from the parent species, and then remains largely unchanged for long periods of time afterward ([link]). this early change model is called punctuated equilibrium, because it begins with a punctuated or periodic change and then remains in balance afterward. while punctuated equilibrium suggests a faster tempo, it does not necessarily exclude gradualism. the primary influencing factor on changes in speciation rate is environmental conditions. under some conditions, selection occurs quickly or radically. consider a species of snails that had been living with the same basic form for many thousands of years. layers of their fossils would appear similar for a long time. when a change in the environment takes placesuch as a drop in the water levela small number of organisms are separated from the rest in a brief period of time, essentially forming one large and one tiny population. the tiny population faces new environmental conditions. because its gene pool quickly became so small, any variation that surfaces and that aids in surviving the new conditions becomes the predominant form. speciation is not a precise division: overlap between closely related species can occur in areas called hybrid zones. organisms reproduce with other similar organisms. the fitness of these hybrid offspring can affect the evolutionary path of the two species. scientists propose two models for the rate of speciation: one model illustrates how a species can change slowly over time; the other model demonstrates how change can occur quickly from a parent generation to a new species. both models continue to follow the patterns of natural selection.","[('rate of speciation', 'rate of speciation', 'rates of speciation', 'rates of speciation'), ('reconnection', 'reconnections'), ('hybrid zone', 'hybrid zones'), ('origin of specy', 'origin of species', 'origin of species', 'origins of specy', 'origins of species', 'origins of species'), ('evolution', 'evolutions'), ('gradual speciation model', 'gradual speciation models', 'gradual speciations model', 'gradual speciations models'), ('punctuated equilibrium', 'punctuated equilibriums')]"

96,stax-bio,19,The Evolution of Populations,1,m44582,Population Evolution,"the mechanisms of inheritance, or genetics, were not understood at the time charles darwin and alfred russel wallace were developing their idea of natural selection. this lack of understanding was a stumbling block to understanding many aspects of evolution. in fact, the predominant (and incorrect) genetic theory of the time, blending inheritance, made it difficult to understand how natural selection might operate. darwin and wallace were unaware of the genetics work by austrian monk gregor mendel, which was published in 1866, not long after publication of darwin's book, on the origin of species. mendels work was rediscovered in the early twentieth century at which time geneticists were rapidly coming to an understanding of the basics of inheritance. initially, the newly discovered particulate nature of genes made it difficult for biologists to understand how gradual evolution could occur. but over the next few decades genetics and evolution were integrated in what became known as the modern synthesisthe coherent understanding of the relationship between natural selection and genetics that took shape by the 1940s and is generally accepted today. in sum, the modern synthesis describes how evolutionary processes, such as natural selection, can affect a populations genetic makeup, and, in turn, how this can result in the gradual evolution of populations and species. the theory also connects this change of a population over time, called microevolution, with the processes that gave rise to new species and higher taxonomic groups with widely divergent characters, called macroevolution. evolution and flu vaccinesevery fall, the media starts reporting on flu vaccinations and potential outbreaks. scientists, health experts, and institutions determine recommendations for different parts of the population, predict optimal production and inoculation schedules, create vaccines, and set up clinics to provide inoculations. you may think of the annual flu shot as a lot of media hype, an important health protection, or just a briefly uncomfortable prick in your arm. but do you think of it in terms of evolution? the media hype of annual flu shots is scientifically grounded in our understanding of evolution. each year, scientists across the globe strive to predict the flu strains that they anticipate being most widespread and harmful in the coming year. this knowledge is based in how flu strains have evolved over time and over the past few flu seasons. scientists then work to create the most effective vaccine to combat those selected strains. hundreds of millions of doses are produced in a short period in order to provide vaccinations to key populations at the optimal time. because viruses, like the flu, evolve very quickly (especially in evolutionary time), this poses quite a challenge. viruses mutate and replicate at a fast rate, so the vaccine developed to protect against last years flu strain may not provide the protection needed against the coming years strain. evolution of these viruses means continued adaptions to ensure survival, including adaptations to survive previous vaccines. recall that a gene for a particular character may have several alleles, or variants, that code for different traits associated with that character. for example, in the abo blood type system in humans, three alleles determine the particular blood-type protein on the surface of red blood cells. each individual in a population of diploid organisms can only carry two alleles for a particular gene, but more than two may be present in the individuals that make up the population. mendel followed alleles as they were inherited from parent to offspring. in the early twentieth century, biologists in a field of study known as population genetics began to study how selective forces change a population through changes in allele and genotypic frequencies. the allele frequency (or gene frequency) is the rate at which a specific allele appears within a population. until now we have discussed evolution as a change in the characteristics of a population of organisms, but behind that phenotypic change is genetic change. in population genetics, the term evolution is defined as a change in the frequency of an allele in a population. using the abo blood type system as an example, the frequency of one of the alleles, ia, is the number of copies of that allele divided by all the copies of the abo gene in the population. for example, a study in jordan1 found a frequency of ia to be 26.1 percent. the ib and i0 alleles made up 13.4 percent and 60.5 percent of the alleles respectively, and all of the frequencies added up to 100 percent. a change in this frequency over time would constitute evolution in the population. the allele frequency within a given population can change depending on environmental factors; therefore, certain alleles become more widespread than others during the process of natural selection. natural selection can alter the populations genetic makeup; for example, if a given allele confers a phenotype that allows an individual to better survive or have more offspring. because many of those offspring will also carry the beneficial allele, and often the corresponding phenotype, they will have more offspring of their own that also carry the allele, thus, perpetuating the cycle. over time, the allele will spread throughout the population. some alleles will quickly become fixed in this way, meaning that every individual of the population will carry the allele, while detrimental mutations may be swiftly eliminated if derived from a dominant allele from the gene pool. the gene pool is the sum of all the alleles in a population. sometimes, allele frequencies within a population change randomly with no advantage to the population over existing allele frequencies. this phenomenon is called genetic drift. natural selection and genetic drift usually occur simultaneously in populations and are not isolated events. it is hard to determine which process dominates because it is often nearly impossible to determine the cause of change in allele frequencies at each occurrence. an event that initiates an allele frequency change in an isolated part of the population, which is not typical of the original population, is called the founder effect. natural selection, random drift, and founder effects can lead to significant changes in the genome of a population. in the early twentieth century, english mathematician godfrey hardy and german physician wilhelm weinberg stated the principle of equilibrium to describe the genetic makeup of a population. the theory, which later became known as the hardy-weinberg principle of equilibrium, states that a populations allele and genotype frequencies are inherently stable unless some kind of evolutionary force is acting upon the population, neither the allele nor the genotypic frequencies would change. the hardy-weinberg principle assumes conditions with no mutations, migration, emigration, or selective pressure for or against genotype, plus an infinite population; while no population can satisfy those conditions, the principle offers a useful model against which to compare real population changes. working under this theory, population geneticists represent different alleles as different variables in their mathematical models. the variable p, for example, often represents the frequency of a particular allele, say y for the trait of yellow in mendels peas, while the variable q represents the frequency of y alleles that confer the color green. if these are the only two possible alleles for a given locus in the population, p + q = 1. in other words, all the p alleles and all the q alleles make up all of the alleles for that locus that are found in the population. but what ultimately interests most biologists is not the frequencies of different alleles, but the frequencies of the resulting genotypes, known as the populations genetic structure, from which scientists can surmise the distribution of phenotypes. if the phenotype is observed, only the genotype of the homozygous recessive alleles can be known; the calculations provide an estimate of the remaining genotypes. since each individual carries two alleles per gene, if the allele frequencies (p and q) are known, predicting the frequencies of these genotypes is a simple mathematical calculation to determine the probability of getting these genotypes if two alleles are drawn at random from the gene pool. so in the above scenario, an individual pea plant could be pp (yy), and thus produce yellow peas; pq (yy), also yellow; or qq (yy), and thus producing green peas ([link]). in other words, the frequency of pp individuals is simply p2; the frequency of pq individuals is 2pq; and the frequency of qq individuals is q2. and, again, if p and q are the only two possible alleles for a given trait in the population, these genotypes frequencies will sum to one: p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. in theory, if a population is at equilibriumthat is, there are no evolutionary forces acting upon itgeneration after generation would have the same gene pool and genetic structure, and these equations would all hold true all of the time. of course, even hardy and weinberg recognized that no natural population is immune to evolution. populations in nature are constantly changing in genetic makeup due to drift, mutation, possibly migration, and selection. as a result, the only way to determine the exact distribution of phenotypes in a population is to go out and count them. but the hardy-weinberg principle gives scientists a mathematical baseline of a non-evolving population to which they can compare evolving populations and thereby infer what evolutionary forces might be at play. if the frequencies of alleles or genotypes deviate from the value expected from the hardy-weinberg equation, then the population is evolving. the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory grew out of the cohesion of darwins, wallaces, and mendels thoughts on evolution and heredity, along with the more modern study of population genetics. it describes the evolution of populations and species, from small-scale changes among individuals to large-scale changes over paleontological time periods. to understand how organisms evolve, scientists can track populations allele frequencies over time. if they differ from generation to generation, scientists can conclude that the population is not in hardy-weinberg equilibrium, and is thus evolving.","[('population genetic', 'population geneticss', 'population genetics'), ('founder effect', 'founder effects'), ('allele frequency', 'allele frequencies'), ('natural selection', 'natural selections'), ('gene pool', 'gene pools'), ('charle darwin', 'charle darwins'), ('microevolution', 'microevolutions'), ('macroevolution', 'macroevolutions'), ('allele', 'alleles'), ('flu strain', 'flu strains'), ('hardy-weinberg equilibrium', 'hardy-weinberg equilibriums'), ('genetic drift', 'genetic drifts'), ('genetic structure', 'genetic structures'), ('alfred russel wallace', 'alfred russel wallaces'), ('gregor mendel', 'gregor mendels'), ('abo blood type', 'abo blood types', 'abo bloods type', 'abo bloods types'), ('modern synthesi', 'modern syntheses', 'modern synthesis'), ('flu shot', 'flu shots'), ('vaccine', 'vaccines')]"
97,stax-bio,19,The Evolution of Populations,2,m44584,Population Genetics,"individuals of a population often display different phenotypes, or express different alleles of a particular gene, referred to as polymorphisms. populations with two or more variations of particular characteristics are called polymorphic. the distribution of phenotypes among individuals, known as the population variation, is influenced by a number of factors, including the populations genetic structure and the environment ([link]). understanding the sources of a phenotypic variation in a population is important for determining how a population will evolve in response to different evolutionary pressures. natural selection and some of the other evolutionary forces can only act on heritable traits, namely an organisms genetic code. because alleles are passed from parent to offspring, those that confer beneficial traits or behaviors may be selected for, while deleterious alleles may be selected against. acquired traits, for the most part, are not heritable. for example, if an athlete works out in the gym every day, building up muscle strength, the athletes offspring will not necessarily grow up to be a body builder. if there is a genetic basis for the ability to run fast, on the other hand, this may be passed to a child. heritability is the fraction of phenotype variation that can be attributed to genetic differences, or genetic variance, among individuals in a population. the greater the hereditability of a populations phenotypic variation, the more susceptible it is to the evolutionary forces that act on heritable variation. the diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance. when scientists are involved in the breeding of a species, such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a populations genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can. this also helps reduce the risks associated with inbreeding, the mating of closely related individuals, which can have the undesirable effect of bringing together deleterious recessive mutations that can cause abnormalities and susceptibility to disease. for example, a disease that is caused by a rare, recessive allele might exist in a population, but it will only manifest itself when an individual carries two copies of the allele. because the allele is rare in a normal, healthy population with unrestricted habitat, the chance that two carriers will mate is low, and even then, only 25 percent of their offspring will inherit the disease allele from both parents. while it is likely to happen at some point, it will not happen frequently enough for natural selection to be able to swiftly eliminate the allele from the population, and as a result, the allele will be maintained at low levels in the gene pool. however, if a family of carriers begins to interbreed with each other, this will dramatically increase the likelihood of two carriers mating and eventually producing diseased offspring, a phenomenon known as inbreeding depression. changes in allele frequencies that are identified in a population can shed light on how it is evolving. in addition to natural selection, there are other evolutionary forces that could be in play: genetic drift, gene flow, mutation, nonrandom mating, and environmental variances. the theory of natural selection stems from the observation that some individuals in a population are more likely to survive longer and have more offspring than others; thus, they will pass on more of their genes to the next generation. a big, powerful male gorilla, for example, is much more likely than a smaller, weaker one to become the populations silverback, the packs leader who mates far more than the other males of the group. the pack leader will father more offspring, who share half of his genes, and are likely to also grow bigger and stronger like their father. over time, the genes for bigger size will increase in frequency in the population, and the population will, as a result, grow larger on average. that is, this would occur if this particular selection pressure, or driving selective force, were the only one acting on the population. in other examples, better camouflage or a stronger resistance to drought might pose a selection pressure. another way a populations allele and genotype frequencies can change is genetic drift ([link]), which is simply the effect of chance. by chance, some individuals will have more offspring than othersnot due to an advantage conferred by some genetically-encoded trait, but just because one male happened to be in the right place at the right time (when the receptive female walked by) or because the other one happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time (when a fox was hunting). small populations are more susceptible to the forces of genetic drift. large populations, on the other hand, are buffered against the effects of chance. if one individual of a population of 10 individuals happens to die at a young age before it leaves any offspring to the next generation, all of its genes1/10 of the populations gene poolwill be suddenly lost. in a population of 100, thats only 1 percent of the overall gene pool; therefore, it is much less impactful on the populations genetic structure. genetic drift can also be magnified by natural events, such as a natural disaster that killsat randoma large portion of the population. known as the bottleneck effect, it results in a large portion of the genome suddenly being wiped out ([link]). in one fell swoop, the genetic structure of the survivors becomes the genetic structure of the entire population, which may be very different from the pre-disaster population. another scenario in which populations might experience a strong influence of genetic drift is if some portion of the population leaves to start a new population in a new location or if a population gets divided by a physical barrier of some kind. in this situation, those individuals are unlikely to be representative of the entire population, which results in the founder effect. the founder effect occurs when the genetic structure changes to match that of the new populations founding fathers and mothers. the founder effect is believed to have been a key factor in the genetic history of the afrikaner population of dutch settlers in south africa, as evidenced by mutations that are common in afrikaners but rare in most other populations. this is likely due to the fact that a higher-than-normal proportion of the founding colonists carried these mutations. as a result, the population expresses unusually high incidences of huntingtons disease (hd) and fanconi anemia (fa), a genetic disorder known to cause blood marrow and congenital abnormalitieseven cancer.1 watch this short video to learn more about the founder and bottleneck effects.

 testing the bottleneck effect question: how do natural disasters affect the genetic structure of a population? background: when much of a population is suddenly wiped out by an earthquake or hurricane, the individuals that survive the event are usually a random sampling of the original group. as a result, the genetic makeup of the population can change dramatically. this phenomenon is known as the bottleneck effect. hypothesis: repeated natural disasters will yield different population genetic structures; therefore, each time this experiment is run, the results will vary. test the hypothesis: count out the original population using different colored beads. for example, red, blue, and yellow beads might represent red, blue, and yellow individuals. after recording the number of each individual in the original population, place them all in a bottle with a narrow neck that will only allow a few beads out at a time. then, pour 1/3 of the bottles contents into a bowl. this represents the surviving individuals after a natural disaster kills a majority of the population. count the number of the different colored beads in the bowl, and record it. then, place all of the beads back in the bottle and repeat the experiment four more times. analyze the data: compare the five populations that resulted from the experiment. do the populations all contain the same number of different colored beads, or do they vary? remember, these populations all came from the same exact parent population. form a conclusion: most likely, the five resulting populations will differ quite dramatically. this is because natural disasters are not selectivethey kill and spare individuals at random. now think about how this might affect a real population. what happens when a hurricane hits the mississippi gulf coast? how do the seabirds that live on the beach fare? another important evolutionary force is gene flow: the flow of alleles in and out of a population due to the migration of individuals or gametes ([link]). while some populations are fairly stable, others experience more flux. many plants, for example, send their pollen far and wide, by wind or by bird, to pollinate other populations of the same species some distance away. even a population that may initially appear to be stable, such as a pride of lions, can experience its fair share of immigration and emigration as developing males leave their mothers to seek out a new pride with genetically unrelated females. this variable flow of individuals in and out of the group not only changes the gene structure of the population, but it can also introduce new genetic variation to populations in different geological locations and habitats. gene flow can occur when an individual travels from one geographic location to another.


 mutations are changes to an organisms dna and are an important driver of diversity in populations. species evolve because of the accumulation of mutations that occur over time. the appearance of new mutations is the most common way to introduce novel genotypic and phenotypic variance. some mutations are unfavorable or harmful and are quickly eliminated from the population by natural selection. others are beneficial and will spread through the population. whether or not a mutation is beneficial or harmful is determined by whether it helps an organism survive to sexual maturity and reproduce. some mutations do not do anything and can linger, unaffected by natural selection, in the genome. some can have a dramatic effect on a gene and the resulting phenotype. if individuals nonrandomly mate with their peers, the result can be a changing population. there are many reasons nonrandom mating occurs. one reason is simple mate choice; for example, female peahens may prefer peacocks with bigger, brighter tails. traits that lead to more matings for an individual become selected for by natural selection. one common form of mate choice, called assortative mating, is an individuals preference to mate with partners who are phenotypically similar to themselves. another cause of nonrandom mating is physical location. this is especially true in large populations spread over large geographic distances where not all individuals will have equal access to one another. some might be miles apart through woods or over rough terrain, while others might live immediately nearby. genes are not the only players involved in determining population variation. phenotypes are also influenced by other factors, such as the environment ([link]). a beachgoer is likely to have darker skin than a city dweller, for example, due to regular exposure to the sun, an environmental factor. some major characteristics, such as sex, are determined by the environment for some species. for example, some turtles and other reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination (tsd). tsd means that individuals develop into males if their eggs are incubated within a certain temperature range, or females at a different temperature range. geographic separation between populations can lead to differences in the phenotypic variation between those populations. such geographical variation is seen between most populations and can be significant. one type of geographic variation, called a cline, can be seen as populations of a given species vary gradually across an ecological gradient. species of warm-blooded animals, for example, tend to have larger bodies in the cooler climates closer to the earths poles, allowing them to better conserve heat. this is considered a latitudinal cline. alternatively, flowering plants tend to bloom at different times depending on where they are along the slope of a mountain, known as an altitudinal cline. if there is gene flow between the populations, the individuals will likely show gradual differences in phenotype along the cline. restricted gene flow, on the other hand, can lead to abrupt differences, even speciation. both genetic and environmental factors can cause phenotypic variation in a population. different alleles can confer different phenotypes, and different environments can also cause individuals to look or act differently. only those differences encoded in an individuals genes, however, can be passed to its offspring and, thus, be a target of natural selection. natural selection works by selecting for alleles that confer beneficial traits or behaviors, while selecting against those for deleterious qualities. genetic drift stems from the chance occurrence that some individuals in the germ line have more offspring than others. when individuals leave or join the population, allele frequencies can change as a result of gene flow. mutations to an individuals dna may introduce new variation into a population. allele frequencies can also be altered when individuals do not randomly mate with others in the group.","[('temperature-dependent sex determination (tsd)', 'temperature-dependent sex determination (tsd)s', 'temperature-dependents sex determination (tsd)', 'temperature-dependents sex determination (tsd)s'), (""huntington' disease"", ""huntington' diseases""), ('bottleneck effect', 'bottleneck effects'), ('gene flow', 'gene flows'), ('inbreeding', 'inbreedings'), ('afrikaner', 'afrikaners'), ('selective pressure', 'selective pressures'), ('inbreeding depression', 'inbreeding depressions'), ('natural selection', 'natural selections'), ('genetic variance', 'genetic variances'), ('fanconi anemium (fa)', 'fanconi anemium (fa)s', 'fanconi anemiums (fa)', 'fanconi anemiums (fa)s'), ('mutation', 'mutations'), ('nonrandom mating', 'nonrandom matings'), ('heritability', 'heritabilities'), ('genetic drift', 'genetic drifts'), ('acquired trait', 'acquired traits'), ('geographical variation', 'geographical variations'), ('polymorphism', 'polymorphisms'), ('altitudinal cline', 'altitudinal clines'), ('assortative mating', 'assortative matings'), ('population variation', 'population variations'), ('physical location', 'physical locations'), ('environmental variance', 'environmental variances'), ('cline', 'clines'), ('latitudinal cline', 'latitudinal clines'), ('jean-baptiste lamarck', 'jean-baptiste lamarcks')]"
98,stax-bio,19,The Evolution of Populations,3,m44586,Adaptive Evolution,"natural selection only acts on the populations heritable traits: selecting for beneficial alleles and thus increasing their frequency in the population, while selecting against deleterious alleles and thereby decreasing their frequencya process known as adaptive evolution. natural selection does not act on individual alleles, however, but on entire organisms. an individual may carry a very beneficial genotype with a resulting phenotype that, for example, increases the ability to reproduce (fecundity), but if that same individual also carries an allele that results in a fatal childhood disease, that fecundity phenotype will not be passed on to the next generation because the individual will not live to reach reproductive age. natural selection acts at the level of the individual; it selects for individuals with greater contributions to the gene pool of the next generation, known as an organisms evolutionary (darwinian) fitness. fitness is often quantifiable and is measured by scientists in the field. however, it is not the absolute fitness of an individual that counts, but rather how it compares to the other organisms in the population. this concept, called relative fitness, allows researchers to determine which individuals are contributing additional offspring to the next generation, and thus, how the population might evolve. there are several ways selection can affect population variation: stabilizing selection, directional selection, diversifying selection, frequency-dependent selection, and sexual selection. as natural selection influences the allele frequencies in a population, individuals can either become more or less genetically similar and the phenotypes displayed can become more similar or more disparate. if natural selection favors an average phenotype, selecting against extreme variation, the population will undergo stabilizing selection ([link]). in a population of mice that live in the woods, for example, natural selection is likely to favor individuals that best blend in with the forest floor and are less likely to be spotted by predators. assuming the ground is a fairly consistent shade of brown, those mice whose fur is most closely matched to that color will be most likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes for their brown coat. mice that carry alleles that make them a bit lighter or a bit darker will stand out against the ground and be more likely to fall victim to predation. as a result of this selection, the populations genetic variance will decrease. when the environment changes, populations will often undergo directional selection ([link]), which selects for phenotypes at one end of the spectrum of existing variation. a classic example of this type of selection is the evolution of the peppered moth in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century england. prior to the industrial revolution, the moths were predominately light in color, which allowed them to blend in with the light-colored trees and lichens in their environment. but as soot began spewing from factories, the trees became darkened, and the light-colored moths became easier for predatory birds to spot. over time, the frequency of the melanic form of the moth increased because they had a higher survival rate in habitats affected by air pollution because their darker coloration blended with the sooty trees. similarly, the hypothetical mouse population may evolve to take on a different coloration if something were to cause the forest floor where they live to change color. the result of this type of selection is a shift in the populations genetic variance toward the new, fit phenotype. sometimes two or more distinct phenotypes can each have their advantages and be selected for by natural selection, while the intermediate phenotypes are, on average, less fit. known as diversifying selection ([link]), this is seen in many populations of animals that have multiple male forms. large, dominant alpha males obtain mates by brute force, while small males can sneak in for furtive copulations with the females in an alpha males territory. in this case, both the alpha males and the sneaking males will be selected for, but medium-sized males, which cant overtake the alpha males and are too big to sneak copulations, are selected against. diversifying selection can also occur when environmental changes favor individuals on either end of the phenotypic spectrum. imagine a population of mice living at the beach where there is light-colored sand interspersed with patches of tall grass. in this scenario, light-colored mice that blend in with the sand would be favored, as well as dark-colored mice that can hide in the grass. medium-colored mice, on the other hand, would not blend in with either the grass or the sand, and would thus be more likely to be eaten by predators. the result of this type of selection is increased genetic variance as the population becomes more diverse. another type of selection, called frequency-dependent selection, favors phenotypes that are either common (positive frequency-dependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-dependent selection). an interesting example of this type of selection is seen in a unique group of lizards of the pacific northwest. male common side-blotched lizards come in three throat-color patterns: orange, blue, and yellow. each of these forms has a different reproductive strategy: orange males are the strongest and can fight other males for access to their females; blue males are medium-sized and form strong pair bonds with their mates; and yellow males ([link]) are the smallest, and look a bit like females, which allows them to sneak copulations. like a game of rock-paper-scissors, orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange in the competition for females. that is, the big, strong orange males can fight off the blue males to mate with the blues pair-bonded females, the blue males are successful at guarding their mates against yellow sneaker males, and the yellow males can sneak copulations from the potential mates of the large, polygynous orange males. in this scenario, orange males will be favored by natural selection when the population is dominated by blue males, blue males will thrive when the population is mostly yellow males, and yellow males will be selected for when orange males are the most populous. as a result, populations of side-blotched lizards cycle in the distribution of these phenotypesin one generation, orange might be predominant, and then yellow males will begin to rise in frequency. once yellow males make up a majority of the population, blue males will be selected for. finally, when blue males become common, orange males will once again be favored. negative frequency-dependent selection serves to increase the populations genetic variance by selecting for rare phenotypes, whereas positive frequency-dependent selection usually decreases genetic variance by selecting for common phenotypes. males and females of certain species are often quite different from one another in ways beyond the reproductive organs. males are often larger, for example, and display many elaborate colors and adornments, like the peacocks tail, while females tend to be smaller and duller in decoration. such differences are known as sexual dimorphisms ([link]), which arise from the fact that in many populations, particularly animal populations, there is more variance in the reproductive success of the males than there is of the females. that is, some malesoften the bigger, stronger, or more decorated malesget the vast majority of the total matings, while others receive none. this can occur because the males are better at fighting off other males, or because females will choose to mate with the bigger or more decorated males. in either case, this variation in reproductive success generates a strong selection pressure among males to get those matings, resulting in the evolution of bigger body size and elaborate ornaments to get the females attention. females, on the other hand, tend to get a handful of selected matings; therefore, they are more likely to select more desirable males. sexual dimorphism varies widely among species, of course, and some species are even sex-role reversed. in such cases, females tend to have a greater variance in their reproductive success than males and are correspondingly selected for the bigger body size and elaborate traits usually characteristic of males. the selection pressures on males and females to obtain matings is known as sexual selection; it can result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics that do not benefit the individuals likelihood of survival but help to maximize its reproductive success. sexual selection can be so strong that it selects for traits that are actually detrimental to the individuals survival. think, once again, about the peacocks tail. while it is beautiful and the male with the largest, most colorful tail is more likely to win the female, it is not the most practical appendage. in addition to being more visible to predators, it makes the males slower in their attempted escapes. there is some evidence that this risk, in fact, is why females like the big tails in the first place. the speculation is that large tails carry risk, and only the best males survive that risk: the bigger the tail, the more fit the male. this idea is known as the handicap principle. the good genes hypothesis states that males develop these impressive ornaments to show off their efficient metabolism or their ability to fight disease. females then choose males with the most impressive traits because it signals their genetic superiority, which they will then pass on to their offspring. though it might be argued that females should not be picky because it will likely reduce their number of offspring, if better males father more fit offspring, it may be beneficial. fewer, healthier offspring may increase the chances of survival more than many, weaker offspring. in both the handicap principle and the good genes hypothesis, the trait is said to be an honest signal of the males quality, thus giving females a way to find the fittest mates males that will pass the best genes to their offspring. natural selection is a driving force in evolution and can generate populations that are better adapted to survive and successfully reproduce in their environments. but natural selection cannot produce the perfect organism. natural selection can only select on existing variation in the population; it does not create anything from scratch. thus, it is limited by a populations existing genetic variance and whatever new alleles arise through mutation and gene flow. natural selection is also limited because it works at the level of individuals, not alleles, and some alleles are linked due to their physical proximity in the genome, making them more likely to be passed on together (linkage disequilibrium). any given individual may carry some beneficial alleles and some unfavorable alleles. it is the net effect of these alleles, or the organisms fitness, upon which natural selection can act. as a result, good alleles can be lost if they are carried by individuals that also have several overwhelmingly bad alleles; likewise, bad alleles can be kept if they are carried by individuals that have enough good alleles to result in an overall fitness benefit. furthermore, natural selection can be constrained by the relationships between different polymorphisms. one morph may confer a higher fitness than another, but may not increase in frequency due to the fact that going from the less beneficial to the more beneficial trait would require going through a less beneficial phenotype. think back to the mice that live at the beach. some are light-colored and blend in with the sand, while others are dark and blend in with the patches of grass. the dark-colored mice may be, overall, more fit than the light-colored mice, and at first glance, one might expect the light-colored mice be selected for a darker coloration. but remember that the intermediate phenotype, a medium-colored coat, is very bad for the micethey cannot blend in with either the sand or the grass and are more likely to be eaten by predators. as a result, the light-colored mice would not be selected for a dark coloration because those individuals that began moving in that direction (began being selected for a darker coat) would be less fit than those that stayed light. finally, it is important to understand that not all evolution is adaptive. while natural selection selects the fittest individuals and often results in a more fit population overall, other forces of evolution, including genetic drift and gene flow, often do the opposite: introducing deleterious alleles to the populations gene pool. evolution has no purposeit is not changing a population into a preconceived ideal. it is simply the sum of the various forces described in this chapter and how they influence the genetic and phenotypic variance of a population. because natural selection acts to increase the frequency of beneficial alleles and traits while decreasing the frequency of deleterious qualities, it is adaptive evolution. natural selection acts at the level of the individual, selecting for those that have a higher overall fitness compared to the rest of the population. if the fit phenotypes are those that are similar, natural selection will result in stabilizing selection, and an overall decrease in the populations variation. directional selection works to shift a populations variance toward a new, fit phenotype, as environmental conditions change. in contrast, diversifying selection results in increased genetic variance by selecting for two or more distinct phenotypes. other types of selection include frequency-dependent selection, in which individuals with either common (positive frequency-dependent selection) or rare (negative frequency-dependent selection) are selected for. finally, sexual selection results from the fact that one sex has more variance in the reproductive success than the other. as a result, males and females experience different selective pressures, which can often lead to the evolution of phenotypic differences, or sexual dimorphisms, between the two.","[('beneficial allele', 'beneficial alleles'), ('sexual selection', 'sexual selections'), ('adaptive evolution', 'adaptive evolutions'), ('r.a. fisher', 'r.a. fishers'), ('positive frequency-dependent selection', 'positive frequency-dependent selections', 'positive frequency-dependents selection', 'positive frequency-dependents selections'), ('honest signal', 'honest signals'), ('peppered moth', 'peppered moths'), ('evolutionary fitnes (also', 'evolutionary fitnes (alsoes', 'evolutionary fitness (also', 'evolutionary fitness (alsoes'), ('diversifying selection', 'diversifying selections'), ('sexual dimorphism', 'sexual dimorphismss', 'sexual dimorphisms'), ('secondary sexual characteristic', 'secondary sexual characteristics'), ('handicap principle', 'handicap principles'), ('natural selection', 'natural selections'), ('unfavorable allele', 'unfavorable alleles'), ('relative fitnes', 'relative fitnesses', 'relative fitness'), ('fisherian runaway model', 'fisherian runaway models'), ('darwinian fitness)', 'darwinian fitness)s'), ('directional selection', 'directional selections'), ('fecundity', 'fecundities'), ('polymorphism', 'polymorphisms'), ('common side-blotched lizard', 'common side-blotched lizardss', 'common side-blotched lizards', 'common side-blotcheds lizard', 'common side-blotcheds lizardss', 'common side-blotcheds lizards'), ('fitnes', 'fitnesses', 'fitness'), ('negative frequency-dependent selection', 'negative frequency-dependent selections', 'negative frequency-dependents selection', 'negative frequency-dependents selections'), ('frequency-dependent selection', 'frequency-dependent selections'), ('sex-role reversed', 'sex-role reverseds'), ('good gene hypothesi', 'good gene hypotheses', 'good gene hypothesis', 'good genes hypothesi', 'good genes hypotheses', 'good genes hypothesis'), ('stabilizing selection', 'stabilizing selections')]"

100,stax-bio,20,Phylogenies and the History of Life,1,m44588,Organizing Life on Earth,"in scientific terms, the evolutionary history and relationship of an organism or group of organisms is called its phylogeny. a phylogeny describes the relationships of an organism, such as from which organisms it is thought to have evolved, to which species it is most closely related, and so forth. phylogenetic relationships provide information on shared ancestry but not necessarily on how organisms are similar or different. scientists use a tool called a phylogenetic tree to show the evolutionary pathways and connections among organisms. a phylogenetic tree is a diagram used to reflect evolutionary relationships among organisms or groups of organisms. scientists consider phylogenetic trees to be a hypothesis of the evolutionary past since one cannot go back to confirm the proposed relationships. in other words, a tree of life can be constructed to illustrate when different organisms evolved and to show the relationships among different organisms ([link]). unlike a taxonomic classification diagram, a phylogenetic tree can be read like a map of evolutionary history. many phylogenetic trees have a single lineage at the base representing a common ancestor. scientists call such trees rooted, which means there is a single ancestral lineage (typically drawn from the bottom or left) to which all organisms represented in the diagram relate. notice in the rooted phylogenetic tree that the three domains bacteria, archaea, and eukaryadiverge from a single point and branch off. the small branch that plants and animals (including humans) occupy in this diagram shows how recent and miniscule these groups are compared with other organisms. unrooted trees dont show a common ancestor but do show relationships among species. in a rooted tree, the branching indicates evolutionary relationships ([link]). the point where a split occurs, called a branch point, represents where a single lineage evolved into a distinct new one. a lineage that evolved early from the root and remains unbranched is called basal taxon. when two lineages stem from the same branch point, they are called sister taxa. a branch with more than two lineages is called a polytomy and serves to illustrate where scientists have not definitively determined all of the relationships. it is important to note that although sister taxa and polytomy do share an ancestor, it does not mean that the groups of organisms split or evolved from each other. organisms in two taxa may have split apart at a specific branch point, but neither taxa gave rise to the other. the diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history. the pathway can be traced from the origin of life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points.  also, by starting with a single species and tracing back towards the ""trunk"" of the tree, one can discover that species' ancestors, as well as where lineages share a common ancestry. in addition, the tree can be used to study entire groups of organisms. another point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information. for example, if a branch point was rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because the evolution of each taxon from the branch point was independent of the other. many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these disciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the tree of life. information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics. data may be collected from fossils, from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism, and by dna analysis. by combining data from many sources, scientists can put together the phylogeny of an organism; since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, they will continue to change as new types of life are discovered and new information is learned. it may be easy to assume that more closely related organisms look more alike, and while this is often the case, it is not always true. if two closely related lineages evolved under significantly varied surroundings or after the evolution of a major new adaptation, it is possible for the two groups to appear more different than other groups that are not as closely related. for example, the phylogenetic tree in [link] shows that lizards and rabbits both have amniotic eggs, whereas frogs do not; yet lizards and frogs appear more similar than lizards and rabbits. another aspect of phylogenetic trees is that, unless otherwise indicated, the branches do not account for length of time, only the evolutionary order. in other words, the length of a branch does not typically mean more time passed, nor does a short branch mean less time passed unless specified on the diagram. for example, in [link], the tree does not indicate how much time passed between the evolution of amniotic eggs and hair. what the tree does show is the order in which things took place. again using [link], the tree shows that the oldest trait is the vertebral column, followed by hinged jaws, and so forth. remember that any phylogenetic tree is a part of the greater whole, and like a real tree, it does not grow in only one direction after a new branch develops. so, for the organisms in [link], just because a vertebral column evolved does not mean that invertebrate evolution ceased, it only means that a new branch formed. also, groups that are not closely related, but evolve under similar conditions, may appear more phenotypically similar to each other than to a close relative. taxonomy (which literally means arrangement law) is the science of classifying organisms to construct internationally shared classification systems with each organism placed into more and more inclusive groupings. think about how a grocery store is organized. one large space is divided into departments, such as produce, dairy, and meats. then each department further divides into aisles, then each aisle into categories and brands, and then finally a single product. this organization from larger to smaller, more specific categories is called a hierarchical system. the taxonomic classification system (also called the linnaean system after its inventor, carl linnaeus, a swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician) uses a hierarchical model. moving from the point of origin, the groups become more specific, until one branch ends as a single species. for example, after the common beginning of all life, scientists divide organisms into three large categories called a domain: bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. within each domain is a second category called a kingdom. after kingdoms, the subsequent categories of increasing specificity are: phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species ([link]). the kingdom animalia stems from the eukarya domain. for the common dog, the classification levels would be as shown in [link]. therefore, the full name of an organism technically has eight terms. for the dog, it is: eukarya, animalia, chordata, mammalia, carnivora, canidae, canis, and lupus. notice that each name is capitalized except for species, and the genus and species names are italicized. scientists generally refer to an organism only by its genus and species, which is its two-word scientific name, in what is called binomial nomenclature. therefore, the scientific name of the dog is canis lupus. the name at each level is also called a taxon. in other words, dogs are in order carnivora. carnivora is the name of the taxon at the order level; canidae is the taxon at the family level, and so forth. organisms also have a common name that people typically use, in this case, dog. note that the dog is additionally a subspecies: the familiaris in canis lupus familiaris. subspecies are members of the same species that are capable of mating and reproducing viable offspring, but they are considered separate subspecies due to geographic or behavioral isolation or other factors. [link] shows how the levels move toward specificity with other organisms. notice how the dog shares a domain with the widest diversity of organisms, including plants and butterflies. at each sublevel, the organisms become more similar because they are more closely related. historically, scientists classified organisms using characteristics, but as dna technology developed, more precise phylogenies have been determined. recent genetic analysis and other advancements have found that some earlier phylogenetic classifications do not align with the evolutionary past; therefore, changes and updates must be made as new discoveries occur. recall that phylogenetic trees are hypotheses and are modified as data becomes available. in addition, classification historically has focused on grouping organisms mainly by shared characteristics and does not necessarily illustrate how the various groups relate to each other from an evolutionary perspective. for example, despite the fact that a hippopotamus resembles a pig more than a whale, the hippopotamus may be the closest living relative of the whale. scientists continually gain new information that helps understand the evolutionary history of life on earth. each group of organisms went through its own evolutionary journey, called its phylogeny. each organism shares relatedness with others, and based on morphologic and genetic evidence, scientists attempt to map the evolutionary pathways of all life on earth. historically, organisms were organized into a taxonomic classification system. however, today many scientists build phylogenetic trees to illustrate evolutionary relationships.","[('family', 'families'), ('taxonomy', 'taxonomies'), ('binomial nomenclature', 'binomial nomenclatures'), ('systematic', 'systematicss', 'systematics'), ('sister taxa', 'sister taxas'), ('phylogeny', 'phylogenies'), ('linnaean system', 'linnaean systems'), ('evolution', 'evolutions'), ('rooted', 'rooteds'), ('polytomy', 'polytomies'), ('genu', 'genera', 'genus'), ('taxon', 'taxons'), ('taxa', 'taxas'), ('tree of life', 'tree of life', 'trees of life', 'trees of life'), ('order', 'orders'), ('classification system', 'classification systems'), ('clas', 'classes', 'class'), ('branch point', 'branch points'), ('phylogenetic tree', 'phylogenetic trees'), ('phylum', 'phyla'), ('evolutionary relationship', 'evolutionary relationshipss', 'evolutionary relationships'), ('carl linnaeu', 'carl linnaeuss', 'carl linnaeus'), ('basal taxon', 'basal taxons'), ('classification level', 'classification levelss', 'classification levels'), ('species', 'species'), ('kingdom', 'kingdoms'), ('phyla', 'phylas'), ('domain', 'domains')]"
101,stax-bio,20,Phylogenies and the History of Life,2,m44591,Determinig Evolutionary Relationships,"scientists must collect accurate information that allows them to make evolutionary connections among organisms. similar to detective work, scientists must use evidence to uncover the facts. in the case of phylogeny, evolutionary investigations focus on two types of evidence: morphologic (form and function) and genetic. in general, organisms that share similar physical features and genomes tend to be more closely related than those that do not. such features that overlap both morphologically (in form) and genetically are referred to as homologous structures; they stem from developmental similarities that are based on evolution. for example, the bones in the wings of bats and birds have homologous structures ([link]). notice it is not simply a single bone, but rather a grouping of several bones arranged in a similar way. the more complex the feature, the more likely any kind of overlap is due to a common evolutionary past. imagine two people from different countries both inventing a car with all the same parts and in exactly the same arrangement without any previous or shared knowledge. that outcome would be highly improbable. however, if two people both invented a hammer, it would be reasonable to conclude that both could have the original idea without the help of the other. the same relationship between complexity and shared evolutionary history is true for homologous structures in organisms. some organisms may be very closely related, even though a minor genetic change caused a major morphological difference to make them look quite different. similarly, unrelated organisms may be distantly related, but appear very much alike. this usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions. when similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship, it is called an analogy or homoplasy. for example, insects use wings to fly like bats and birds, but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different. these are called analogous structures ([link]). similar traits can be either homologous or analogous. homologous structures share a similar embryonic origin; analogous organs have a similar function. for example, the bones in the front flipper of a whale are homologous to the bones in the human arm. these structures are not analogous. the wings of a butterfly and the wings of a bird are analogous but not homologous. some structures are both analogous and homologous: the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat are both homologous and analogous. scientists must determine which type of similarity a feature exhibits to decipher the phylogeny of the organisms being studied. with the advancement of dna technology, the area of molecular systematics, which describes the use of information on the molecular level including dna analysis, has blossomed. new computer programs not only confirm many earlier classified organisms, but also uncover previously made errors. as with physical characteristics, even the dna sequence can be tricky to read in some cases. for some situations, two very closely related organisms can appear unrelated if a mutation occurred that caused a shift in the genetic code. an insertion or deletion mutation would move each nucleotide base over one place, causing two similar codes to appear unrelated. sometimes two segments of dna code in distantly related organisms randomly share a high percentage of bases in the same locations, causing these organisms to appear closely related when they are not. for both of these situations, computer technologies have been developed to help identify the actual relationships, and, ultimately, the coupled use of both morphologic and molecular information is more effective in determining phylogeny. why does phylogeny matter?evolutionary biologists could list many reasons why understanding phylogeny is important to everyday life in human society. for botanists, phylogeny acts as a guide to discovering new plants that can be used to benefit people. think of all the ways humans use plantsfood, medicine, and clothing are a few examples. if a plant contains a compound that is effective in treating cancer, scientists might want to examine all of the relatives of that plant for other useful drugs. a research team in china identified a segment of dna thought to be common to some medicinal plants in the family fabaceae (the legume family) and worked to identify which species had this segment ([link]). after testing plant species in this family, the team found a dna marker (a known location on a chromosome that enabled them to identify the species) present. then, using the dna to uncover phylogenetic relationships, the team could identify whether a newly discovered plant was in this family and assess its potential medicinal properties. how do scientists construct phylogenetic trees? after the homologous and analogous traits are sorted, scientists often organize the homologous traits using a system called cladistics. this system sorts organisms into clades: groups of organisms that descended from a single ancestor. for example, in [link], all of the organisms in the orange region evolved from a single ancestor that had amniotic eggs. consequently, all of these organisms also have amniotic eggs and make a single clade, also called a monophyletic group. clades must include all of the descendants from a branch point. clades can vary in size depending on which branch point is being referenced. the important factor is that all of the organisms in the clade or monophyletic group stem from a single point on the tree. this can be remembered because monophyletic breaks down into mono, meaning one, and phyletic, meaning evolutionary relationship. [link] shows various examples of clades. notice how each clade comes from a single point, whereas the non-clade groups show branches that do not share a single point. organisms evolve from common ancestors and then diversify. scientists use the phrase descent with modification because even though related organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes, changes occur. this pattern repeats over and over as one goes through the phylogenetic tree of life:  a change in the genetic makeup of an organism leads to a new trait which becomes prevalent in the group. many organisms descend from this point and have this trait. new variations continue to arise: some are adaptive and persist, leading to new traits. with new traits, a new branch point is determined (go back to step 1 and repeat).  if a characteristic is found in the ancestor of a group, it is considered a shared ancestral character because all of the organisms in the taxon or clade have that trait. the vertebrate in [link] is a shared ancestral character. now consider the amniotic egg characteristic in the same figure. only some of the organisms in [link] have this trait, and to those that do, it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree. the tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative. the same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used. returning to [link], note that the amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for the amniota clade, while having hair is a shared derived character for some organisms in this group. these terms help scientists distinguish between clades in the building of phylogenetic trees. imagine being the person responsible for organizing all of the items in a department store properlyan overwhelming task. organizing the evolutionary relationships of all life on earth proves much more difficult: scientists must span enormous blocks of time and work with information from long-extinct organisms. trying to decipher the proper connections, especially given the presence of homologies and analogies, makes the task of building an accurate tree of life extraordinarily difficult. add to that the advancement of dna technology, which now provides large quantities of genetic sequences to be used and analyzed. taxonomy is a subjective discipline: many organisms have more than one connection to each other, so each taxonomist will decide the order of connections. to aid in the tremendous task of describing phylogenies accurately, scientists often use a concept called maximum parsimony, which means that events occurred in the simplest, most obvious way. for example, if a group of people entered a forest preserve to go hiking, based on the principle of maximum parsimony, one could predict that most of the people would hike on established trails rather than forge new ones. for scientists deciphering evolutionary pathways, the same idea is used: the pathway of evolution probably includes the fewest major events that coincide with the evidence at hand. starting with all of the homologous traits in a group of organisms, scientists look for the most obvious and simple order of evolutionary events that led to the occurrence of those traits. to build phylogenetic trees, scientists must collect accurate information that allows them to make evolutionary connections between organisms. using morphologic and molecular data, scientists work to identify homologous characteristics and genes. similarities between organisms can stem either from shared evolutionary history (homologies) or from separate evolutionary paths (analogies). newer technologies can be used to help distinguish homologies from analogies. after homologous information is identified, scientists use cladistics to organize these events as a means to determine an evolutionary timeline. scientists apply the concept of maximum parsimony, which states that the order of events probably occurred in the most obvious and simple way with the least amount of steps. for evolutionary events, this would be the path with the least number of major divergences that correlate with the evidence.","[('tree of life', 'tree of life', 'trees of life', 'trees of life'), ('shared

102,stax-bio,20,Phylogenies and the History of Life,3,m44593,Perspectives on the Phylogenetic Tree,"the concepts of phylogenetic modeling are constantly changing. it is one of the most dynamic fields of study in all of biology. over the last several decades, new research has challenged scientists ideas about how organisms are related. new models of these relationships have been proposed for consideration by the scientific community. many phylogenetic trees have been shown as models of the evolutionary relationship among species. phylogenetic trees originated with charles darwin, who sketched the first phylogenetic tree in 1837 ([link]a), which served as a pattern for subsequent studies for more than a century. the concept of a phylogenetic tree with a single trunk representing a common ancestor, with the branches representing the divergence of species from this ancestor, fits well with the structure of many common trees, such as the oak ([link]b). however, evidence from modern dna sequence analysis and newly developed computer algorithms has caused skepticism about the validity of the standard tree model in the scientific community. classical thinking about prokaryotic evolution, included in the classic tree model, is that species evolve clonally. that is, they produce offspring themselves with only random mutations causing the descent into the variety of modern-day and extinct species known to science. this view is somewhat complicated in eukaryotes that reproduce sexually, but the laws of mendelian genetics explain the variation in offspring, again, to be a result of a mutation within the species. the concept of genes being transferred between unrelated species was not considered as a possibility until relatively recently. horizontal gene transfer (hgt), also known as lateral gene transfer, is the transfer of genes between unrelated species. hgt has been shown to be an ever-present phenomenon, with many evolutionists postulating a major role for this process in evolution, thus complicating the simple tree model. genes have been shown to be passed between species which are only distantly related using standard phylogeny, thus adding a layer of complexity to the understanding of phylogenetic relationships. the various ways that hgt occurs in prokaryotes is important to understanding phylogenies. although at present hgt is not viewed as important to eukaryotic evolution, hgt does occur in this domain as well. finally, as an example of the ultimate gene transfer, theories of genome fusion between symbiotic or endosymbiotic organisms have been proposed to explain an event of great importancethe evolution of the first eukaryotic cell, without which humans could not have come into existence. horizontal gene transfer (hgt) is the introduction of genetic material from one species to another species by mechanisms other than the vertical transmission from parent(s) to offspring. these transfers allow even distantly related species to share genes, influencing their phenotypes. it is thought that hgt is more prevalent in prokaryotes, but that only about 2% of the prokaryotic genome may be transferred by this process. some researchers believe such estimates are premature:  the actual importance of hgt to evolutionary processes must be viewed as a work in progress. as the phenomenon is investigated more thoroughly, it may be revealed to be more common. many scientists believe that hgt and mutation appear to be (especially in prokaryotes) a significant source of genetic variation, which is the raw material for the process of natural selection. these transfers may occur between any two species that share an intimate relationship ([link]). the mechanism of hgt has been shown to be quite common in the prokaryotic domains of bacteria and archaea, significantly changing the way their evolution is viewed. the majority of evolutionary models, such as in the endosymbiont theory, propose that eukaryotes descended from multiple prokaryotes, which makes hgt all the more important to understanding the phylogenetic relationships of all extant and extinct species. the fact that genes are transferred among common bacteria is well known to microbiology students. these gene transfers between species are the major mechanism whereby bacteria acquire resistance to antibiotics. classically, this type of transfer has been thought to occur by three different mechanisms:  transformation: naked dna is taken up by a bacteria transduction: genes are transferred using a virus conjugation: the use a hollow tube called a pilus to transfer genes between organisms  more recently, a fourth mechanism of gene transfer between prokaryotes has been discovered. small, virus-like particles called gene transfer agents (gtas) transfer random genomic segments from one species of prokaryote to another. gtas have been shown to be responsible for genetic changes, sometimes at a very high frequency compared to other evolutionary processes. the first gta was characterized in 1974 using purple, non-sulfur bacteria. these gtas, which are thought to be bacteriophages that lost the ability to reproduce on their own, carry random pieces of dna from one organism to another. the ability of gtas to act with high frequency has been demonstrated in controlled studies using marine bacteria. gene transfer events in marine prokaryotes, either by gtas or by viruses, have been estimated to be as high as 1013 per year in the mediterranean sea alone. gtas and viruses are thought to be efficient hgt vehicles with a major impact on prokaryotic evolution. as a consequence of this modern dna analysis, the idea that eukaryotes evolved directly from archaea has fallen out of favor. while eukaryotes share many features that are absent in bacteria, such as the tata box (found in the promoter region of many genes), the discovery that some eukaryotic genes were more homologous with bacterial dna than archaea dna made this idea less tenable. furthermore, the fusion of genomes from archaea and bacteria by endosymbiosis has been proposed as the ultimate event in eukaryotic evolution. although it is easy to see how prokaryotes exchange genetic material by hgt, it was initially thought that this process was absent in eukaryotes. after all, prokaryotes are but single cells exposed directly to their environment, whereas the sex cells of multicellular organisms are usually sequestered in protected parts of the body. it follows from this idea that the gene transfers between multicellular eukaryotes should be more difficult. indeed, it is thought that this process is rarer in eukaryotes and has a much smaller evolutionary impact than in prokaryotes. in spite of this fact, hgt between distantly related organisms has been demonstrated in several eukaryotic species, and it is possible that more examples will be discovered in the future. in plants, gene transfer has been observed in species that cannot cross-pollinate by normal means. transposons or jumping genes have been shown to transfer between rice and millet plant species. furthermore, fungal species feeding on yew trees, from which the anti-cancer drug taxol is derived from the bark, have acquired the ability to make taxol themselves, a clear example of gene transfer. in animals, a particularly interesting example of hgt occurs within the aphid species ([link]). aphids are insects that vary in color based on carotenoid content. carotenoids are pigments made by a variety of plants, fungi, and microbes, and they serve a variety of functions in animals, who obtain these chemicals from their food. humans require carotenoids to synthesize vitamin a, and we obtain them by eating orange fruits and vegetables: carrots, apricots, mangoes, and sweet potatoes. on the other hand, aphids have acquired the ability to make the carotenoids on their own. according to dna analysis, this ability is due to the transfer of fungal genes into the insect by hgt, presumably as the insect consumed fungi for food. a carotenoid enzyme called a desaturase is responsible for the red coloration seen in certain aphids, and it has been further shown that when this gene is inactivated by mutation, the aphids revert back to their more common green color ([link]). scientists believe the ultimate in hgt occurs through genome fusion between different species of prokaryotes when two symbiotic organisms become endosymbiotic. this occurs when one species is taken inside the cytoplasm of another species, which ultimately results in a genome consisting of genes from both the endosymbiont and the host. this mechanism is an aspect of the endosymbiont theory, which is accepted by a majority of biologists as the mechanism whereby eukaryotic cells obtained their mitochondria and chloroplasts. however, the role of endosymbiosis in the development of the nucleus is more controversial. nuclear and mitochondrial dna are thought to be of different (separate) evolutionary origin, with the mitochondrial dna being derived from the circular genomes of bacteria that were engulfed by ancient prokaryotic cells. mitochondrial dna can be regarded as the smallest chromosome. interestingly enough, mitochondrial dna is inherited only from the mother. the mitochondrial dna degrades in sperm when the sperm degrades in the fertilized egg or in other instances when the mitochondria located in the flagellum of the sperm fails to enter the egg. within the past decade, the process of genome fusion by endosymbiosis has been proposed by james lake of the ucla/nasa astrobiology institute to be responsible for the evolution of the first eukaryotic cells ([link]a). using dna analysis and a new mathematical algorithm called conditioned reconstruction (cr), his laboratory proposed that eukaryotic cells developed from an endosymbiotic gene fusion between two species, one an archaea and the other a bacteria. as mentioned, some eukaryotic genes resemble those of archaea, whereas others resemble those from bacteria. an endosymbiotic fusion event, such as lake has proposed, would clearly explain this observation. on the other hand, this work is new and the cr algorithm is relatively unsubstantiated, which causes many scientists to resist this hypothesis. more recent work by lake ([link]b) proposes that gram-negative bacteria, which are unique within their domain in that they contain two lipid bilayer membranes, indeed resulted from an endosymbiotic fusion of archaeal and bacterial species. the double membrane would be a direct result of the endosymbiosis, with the endosymbiont picking up the second membrane from the host as it was internalized. this mechanism has also been used to explain the double membranes found in mitochondria and chloroplasts. lakes work is not without skepticism, and the ideas are still debated within the biological science community. in addition to lakes hypothesis, there are several other competing theories as to the origin of eukaryotes. how did the eukaryotic nucleus evolve? one theory is that the prokaryotic cells produced an additional membrane that surrounded the bacterial chromosome. some bacteria have the dna enclosed by two membranes; however, there is no evidence of a nucleolus or nuclear pores. other proteobacteria also have membrane-bound chromosomes. if the eukaryotic nucleus evolved this way, we would expect one of the two types of prokaryotes to be more closely related to eukaryotes. the nucleus-first hypothesis proposes that the nucleus evolved in prokaryotes first ([link]a), followed by a later fusion of the new eukaryote with bacteria that became mitochondria. the mitochondria-first hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were first established in a prokaryotic host ([link]b), which subsequently acquired a nucleus, by fusion or other mechanisms, to become the first eukaryotic cell. most interestingly, the eukaryote-first hypothesis proposes that prokaryotes actually evolved from eukaryotes by losing genes and complexity ([link]c). all of these hypotheses are testable. only time and more experimentation will determine which hypothesis is best supported by data. the recognition of the importance of hgt, especially in the evolution of prokaryotes, has caused some to propose abandoning the classic tree of life model. in 1999, w. ford doolittle proposed a phylogenetic model that resembles a web or a network more than a tree. the hypothesis is that eukaryotes evolved not from a single prokaryotic ancestor, but from a pool of many species that were sharing genes by hgt mechanisms. as shown in [link]a, some individual prokaryotes were responsible for transferring the bacteria that caused mitochondrial development to the new eukaryotes, whereas other species transferred the bacteria that gave rise to chloroplasts. this model is often called the web of life. in an effort to save the tree analogy, some have proposed using the ficus tree ([link]b) with its multiple trunks as a phylogenetic to represent a diminished evolutionary role for hgt. others have proposed abandoning any tree-like model of phylogeny in favor of a ring structure, the so-called ring of life ([link]); a phylogenetic model where all three domains of life evolved from a pool of primitive prokaryotes. lake, again using the conditioned reconstruction algorithm, proposes a ring-like model in which species of all three domainsarchaea, bacteria, and eukaryaevolved from a single pool of gene-swapping prokaryotes. his laboratory proposes that this structure is the best fit for data from extensive dna analyses performed in his laboratory, and that the ring model is the only one that adequately takes hgt and genomic fusion into account. however, other phylogeneticists remain highly skeptical of this model. in summary, the tree of life model proposed by darwin must be modified to include hgt. does this mean abandoning the tree model completely? even lake argues that all attempts should be made to discover some modification of the tree model to allow it to accurately fit his data, and only the inability to do so will sway people toward his ring proposal. this doesnt mean a tree, web, or a ring will correlate completely to an accurate description of phylogenetic relationships of life. a consequence of the new thinking about phylogenetic models is the idea that darwins original conception of the phylogenetic tree is too simple, but made sense based on what was known at the time. however, the search for a more useful model moves on: each model serving as hypotheses to be tested with the possibility of developing new models. this is how science advances. these models are used as visualizations to help construct hypothetical evolutionary relationships and understand the massive amount of data being analyzed. the phylogenetic tree, first used by darwin, is the classic tree of life model describing phylogenetic relationships among species, and the most common model used today. new ideas about hgt and genome fusion have caused some to suggest revising the model to resemble webs or rings.","[('gene transfer

103,stax-bio,21,Viruses,0,m44594,Introduction,"no one knows exactly when viruses emerged or from where they came, since viruses do not leave historical footprints such as fossils. modern viruses are thought to be a mosaic of bits and pieces of nucleic acids picked up from various sources along their respective evolutionary paths. viruses are acellular, parasitic entities that are not classified within any kingdom. unlike most living organisms, viruses are not cells and cannot divide. instead, they infect a host cell and use the hosts replication processes to produce identical progeny virus particles. viruses infect organisms as diverse as bacteria, plants, and animals. they exist in a netherworld between a living organism and a nonliving entity. living things grow, metabolize, and reproduce. viruses replicate, but to do so, they are entirely dependent on their host cells. they do not metabolize or grow, but are assembled in their mature form.","[('viral assembly', 'viral assemblies'), ('oncogenic viru', 'oncogenic viruss', 'oncogenic virus'), ('pathogen', 'pathogenss', 'pathogens'), ('productive', 'productives'), ('hyperplasium', 'hyperplasias', 'hyperplasia'), ('viral receptor', 'viral receptorss', 'viral receptors'), ('horizontal transmission', 'horizontal transmissions'), ('isometric viruse', 'isometric virusess', 'isometric viruses'), ('phage therapy', 'phage therapies'), ('viroid', 'viroidss', 'viroids'), ('viru evolution', 'viru evolutions'), ('latency', 'latencies'), ('vertical transmission', 'vertical transmissions'), ('vaccine', 'vaccines'), ('receptor', 'receptors'), ('attenuating', 'attenuatings'), ('virologist', 'virologists'), ('killed vaccine', 'killed vaccines'), ('viru attachment', 'viru attachments'), ('viru detection', 'viru detections'), ('group iv', 'group ivs'), ('reverse transcriptase', 'reverse transcriptases'), ('back mutation', 'back mutations'), ('positive polarity', 'positive polarities'), ('enveloped viruse', 'enveloped virusess', 'enveloped viruses'), ('group v', 'group vs'), ('capsid', 'capsids'), ('filamentous viruse', 'filamentous virusess', 'filamentous viruses'), ('hypoplasium', 'hypoplasias', 'hypoplasia'), ('egres', 'egresses', 'egress'), ('host', 'hosts'), ('prion protein', 'prion proteins'), ('cytopathic', 'cytopathics'), ('intermittent', 'intermittents'), ('enveloped virion', 'enveloped virionss', 'enveloped virions'), ('viral replication', 'viral replications'), ('viru infection', 'viru infections'), ('hiv', 'hivs'), ('group iius', 'group iiis', 'group iii'), ('envelope', 'envelopes'), ('group vus', 'group vis', 'group vi'), ('viral capsid', 'viral capsidss', 'viral capsids'), ('virology', 'virologies'), ('acute', 'acutes'), ('gene therapy', 'gene therapies'), ('viru discovery', 'viru discoveries'), ('vaccination', 'vaccinations'), ('virion', 'virions'), ('matrix protein', 'matrix proteinss', 'matrix proteins'), ('group ius', 'group iis', 'group ii'), ('negative polarity', 'negative polarities'), ('asymptomatic infection', 'asymptomatic infections'), ('cell necrosi', 'cell necroses', 'cell necrosis'), ('bacteriophage', 'bacteriophages'), ('live vaccine', 'live vaccines'), ('fusion', 'fusions'), ('oncolytic viru', 'oncolytic viruss', 'oncolytic virus'), ('budding', 'buddings'), ('lysi', 'lyses', 'lysis'), ('prp', 'prps'), ('antiviral drug', 'antiviral drugs'), ('head and tail viruse', 'head and tail virusess', 'head and tail viruses', 'head and tails viruse', 'head and tails virusess', 'head and tails viruses', 'heads and tail viruse', 'heads and tail virusess', 'heads and tail viruses', 'heads and tails viruse', 'heads and tails virusess', 'heads and tails viruses'), ('lysogenic cycle', 'lysogenic cycles'), ('acellular', 'acellulars'), ('azt', 'azts'), ('capsomere', 'capsomeress', 'capsomeres'), ('gall', 'gallss', 'galls'), ('lytic cycle', 'lytic cycles'), ('replicative intermediate', 'replicative intermediatess', 'replicative intermediates'), ('viral morphology', 'viral morphologies'), ('viru core', 'viru cores'), ('viru', 'viruss', 'virus'), ('chronic', 'chronics'), ('group i', 'group is'), ('viru entry', 'viru entries'), ('permissive', 'permissives'), ('prophage', 'prophages'), ('prion', 'prionss', 'prions'), ('group vius', 'group viis', 'group vii')]"
104,stax-bio,21,Viruses,1,m44595,"Viral Evolution, Morphology, and Classification","viruses are diverse entities. they vary in their structure, their replication methods, and in their target hosts. nearly all forms of lifefrom bacteria and archaea to eukaryotes such as plants, animals, and fungihave viruses that infect them. while most biological diversity can be understood through evolutionary history, such as how species have adapted to conditions and environments, much about virus origins and evolution remains unknown. viruses were first discovered after the development of a porcelain filter, called the chamberland-pasteur filter, which could remove all bacteria visible in the microscope from any liquid sample. in 1886, adolph meyer demonstrated that a disease of tobacco plants, tobacco mosaic disease, could be transferred from a diseased plant to a healthy one via liquid plant extracts. in 1892, dmitri ivanowski showed that this disease could be transmitted in this way even after the chamberland-pasteur filter had removed all viable bacteria from the extract. still, it was many years before it was proven that these filterable infectious agents were not simply very small bacteria but were a new type of very small, disease-causing particle. virions, single virus particles, are very small, about 20250 nanometers in diameter. these individual virus particles are the infectious form of a virus outside the host cell. unlike bacteria (which are about 100-times larger), we cannot see viruses with a light microscope, with the exception of some large virions of the poxvirus family. it was not until the development of the electron microscope in the late 1930s that scientists got their first good view of the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus (tmv) ([link]) and other viruses ([link]). the surface structure of virions can be observed by both scanning and transmission electron microscopy, whereas the internal structures of the virus can only be observed in images from a transmission electron microscope. the use of these technologies has allowed for the discovery of many viruses of all types of living organisms. they were initially grouped by shared morphology. later, groups of viruses were classified by the type of nucleic acid they contained, dna or rna, and whether their nucleic acid was single- or double-stranded. more recently, molecular analysis of viral replicative cycles has further refined their classification. although biologists have accumulated a significant amount of knowledge about how present-day viruses evolve, much less is known about how viruses originated in the first place. when exploring the evolutionary history of most organisms, scientists can look at fossil records and similar historic evidence. however, viruses do not fossilize, so researchers must conjecture by investigating how todays viruses evolve and by using biochemical and genetic information to create speculative virus histories. while most findings agree that viruses dont have a single common ancestor, scholars have yet to find a single hypothesis about virus origins that is fully accepted in the field. one such hypothesis, called devolution or the regressive hypothesis, proposes to explain the origin of viruses by suggesting that viruses evolved from free-living cells. however, many components of how this process might have occurred are a mystery. a second hypothesis (called escapist or the progressive hypothesis) accounts for viruses having either an rna or a dna genome and suggests that viruses originated from rna and dna molecules that escaped from a host cell. a third hypothesis posits a system of self-replication similar to that of other self-replicating molecules, likely evolving alongside the cells they rely on as hosts; studies of some plant pathogens support this hypothesis. as technology advances, scientists may develop and refine further hypotheses to explain the origin of viruses. the emerging field called virus molecular systematics attempts to do just that through comparisons of sequenced genetic material. these researchers hope to one day better understand the origin of viruses, a discovery that could lead to advances in the treatments for the ailments they produce. viruses are acellular, meaning they are biological entities that do not have a cellular structure. they therefore lack most of the components of cells, such as organelles, ribosomes, and the plasma membrane. a virion consists of a nucleic acid core, an outer protein coating or capsid, and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the host cell. viruses may also contain additional proteins, such as enzymes. the most obvious difference between members of viral families is their morphology, which is quite diverse. an interesting feature of viral complexity is that the complexity of the host does not correlate with the complexity of the virion. some of the most complex virion structures are observed in bacteriophages, viruses that infect the simplest living organisms, bacteria. viruses come in many shapes and sizes, but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family. all virions have a nucleic acid genome covered by a protective layer of proteins, called a capsid. the capsid is made up of protein subunits called capsomeres. some viral capsids are simple polyhedral spheres, whereas others are quite complex in structure. in general, the shapes of viruses are classified into four groups: filamentous, isometric (or icosahedral), enveloped, and head and tail. filamentous viruses are long and cylindrical. many plant viruses are filamentous, including tmv. isometric viruses have shapes that are roughly spherical, such as poliovirus or herpesviruses. enveloped viruses have membranes surrounding capsids. animal viruses, such as hiv, are frequently enveloped. head and tail viruses infect bacteria and have a head that is similar to icosahedral viruses and a tail shape like filamentous viruses. many viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells via molecules on the cell called viral receptors ([link]). for these viruses, attachment is a requirement for later penetration of the cell membrane, so they can complete their replication inside the cell. the receptors that viruses use are molecules that are normally found on cell surfaces and have their own physiological functions. viruses have simply evolved to make use of these molecules for their own replication. for example, hiv uses the cd4 molecule on t lymphocytes as one of its receptors. cd4 is a type of molecule called a cell adhesion molecule, which functions to keep different types of immune cells in close proximity to each other during the generation of a t lymphocyte immune response. among the most complex virions known, the t4 bacteriophage, which infects the escherichia coli bacterium, has a tail structure that the virus uses to attach to host cells and a head structure that houses its dna. adenovirus, a non-enveloped animal virus that causes respiratory illnesses in humans, uses glycoprotein spikes protruding from its capsomeres to attach to host cells. non-enveloped viruses also include those that cause polio (poliovirus), plantar warts (papillomavirus), and hepatitis a (hepatitis a virus). enveloped virions like hiv, the causative agent in aids, consist of nucleic acid (rna in the case of hiv) and capsid proteins surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer envelope and its associated proteins. glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope are used to attach to host cells. other envelope proteins are the matrix proteins that stabilize the envelope and often play a role in the assembly of progeny virions. chicken pox, influenza, and mumps are examples of diseases caused by viruses with envelopes. because of the fragility of the envelope, non-enveloped viruses are more resistant to changes in temperature, ph, and some disinfectants than enveloped viruses. overall, the shape of the virion and the presence or absence of an envelope tell us little about what disease the virus may cause or what species it might infect, but they are still useful means to begin viral classification ([link]). unlike nearly all living organisms that use dna as their genetic material, viruses may use either dna or rna as theirs. the virus core contains the genome or total genetic content of the virus. viral genomes tend to be small, containing only those genes that encode proteins that the virus cannot get from the host cell. this genetic material may be single- or double-stranded. it may also be linear or circular. while most viruses contain a single nucleic acid, others have genomes that have several, which are called segments. in dna viruses, the viral dna directs the host cells replication proteins to synthesize new copies of the viral genome and to transcribe and translate that genome into viral proteins. dna viruses cause human diseases, such as chickenpox, hepatitis b, and some venereal diseases, like herpes and genital warts. rna viruses contain only rna as their genetic material. to replicate their genomes in the host cell, the rna viruses encode enzymes that can replicate rna into dna, which cannot be done by the host cell. these rna polymerase enzymes are more likely to make copying errors than dna polymerases, and therefore often make mistakes during transcription. for this reason, mutations in rna viruses occur more frequently than in dna viruses. this causes them to change and adapt more rapidly to their host. human diseases caused by rna viruses include hepatitis c, measles, and rabies. to understand the features shared among different groups of viruses, a classification scheme is necessary. as most viruses are not thought to have evolved from a common ancestor, however, the methods that scientists use to classify living things are not very useful. biologists have used several classification systems in the past, based on the morphology and genetics of the different viruses. however, these earlier classification methods grouped viruses differently, based on which features of the virus they were using to classify them. the most commonly used classification method today is called the baltimore classification scheme and is based on how messenger rna (mrna) is generated in each particular type of virus. viruses are classified in several ways: by factors such as their core content ([link] and [link]), the structure of their capsids, and whether they have an outer envelope. the type of genetic material (dna or rna) and its structure (single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, and segmented or non-segmented) are used to classify the virus core structures. viruses can also be classified by the design of their capsids ([link] and [link]). capsids are classified as naked icosahedral, enveloped icosahedral, enveloped helical, naked helical, and complex ([link] and [link]). the type of genetic material (dna or rna) and its structure (single- or double-stranded, linear or circular, and segmented or non-segmented) are used to classify the virus core structures ([link]). the most commonly used system of virus classification was developed by nobel prize-winning biologist david baltimore in the early 1970s. in addition to the differences in morphology and genetics mentioned above, the baltimore classification scheme groups viruses according to how the mrna is produced during the replicative cycle of the virus. group i viruses contain double-stranded dna (dsdna) as their genome. their mrna is produced by transcription in much the same way as with cellular dna. group ii viruses have single-stranded dna (ssdna) as their genome. they convert their single-stranded genomes into a dsdna intermediate before transcription to mrna can occur. group iii viruses use dsrna as their genome. the strands separate, and one of them is used as a template for the generation of mrna using the rna-dependent rna polymerase encoded by the virus. group iv viruses have ssrna as their genome with a positive polarity. positive polarity means that the genomic rna can serve directly as mrna. intermediates of dsrna, called replicative intermediates, are made in the process of copying the genomic rna. multiple, full-length rna strands of negative polarity (complimentary to the positive-stranded genomic rna) are formed from these intermediates, which may then serve as templates for the production of rna with positive polarity, including both full-length genomic rna and shorter viral mrnas. group v viruses contain ssrna genomes with a negative polarity, meaning that their sequence is complementary to the mrna. as with group iv viruses, dsrna intermediates are used to make copies of the genome and produce mrna. in this case, the negative-stranded genome can be converted directly to mrna. additionally, full-length positive rna strands are made to serve as templates for the production of the negative-stranded genome. group vi viruses have diploid (two copies) ssrna genomes that must be converted, using the enzyme reverse transcriptase, to dsdna; the dsdna is then transported to the nucleus of the host cell and inserted into the host genome. then, mrna can be produced by transcription of the viral dna that was integrated into the host genome. group vii viruses have partial dsdna genomes and make ssrna intermediates that act as mrna, but are also converted back into dsdna genomes by reverse transcriptase, necessary for genome replication. the characteristics of each group in the baltimore classification are summarized in [link] with examples of each group. viruses are tiny, acellular entities that can usually only be seen with an electron microscope. their genomes contain either dna or rnanever bothand they replicate using the replication proteins of a host cell. viruses are diverse, infecting archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. viruses consist of a nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein capsid with or without an outer lipid envelope. the capsid shape, presence of an envelope, and core composition dictate some elements of the classification of viruses. the most commonly used classification method, the baltimore classification, categorizes viruses based on how they produce their mrna.","[('viral receptor', 'viral receptorss', 'viral receptors'), ('isometric viruse', 'isometric virusess', 'isometric viruses'), ('viru evolution', 'viru

105,stax-bio,21,Viruses,2,m44597,Virus Infections and Hosts,"viruses can be seen as obligate, intracellular parasites. a virus must attach to a living cell, be taken inside, manufacture its proteins and copy its genome, and find a way to escape the cell so that the virus can infect other cells. viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within that host. cells that a virus may use to replicate are called permissive. for most viruses, the molecular basis for this specificity is that a particular surface molecule known as the viral receptor must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to attach. also, metabolic and host cell immune response differences seen in different cell types based on differential gene expression are a likely factor in which cells a virus may target for replication. the permissive cell must make the substances that the virus needs or the virus will not be able to replicate there. a virus must use cell processes to replicate. the viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. these changes, called cytopathic (causing cell damage) effects, can change cell functions or even destroy the cell. some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, die through lysis (bursting) or apoptosis (programmed cell death or cell suicide), releasing all progeny virions at once. the symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus, which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body, and from cell damage caused by the virus. many animal viruses, such as hiv (human immunodeficiency virus), leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding, where virions leave the cell individually. during the budding process, the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed. however, the damage to the cells that the virus infects may make it impossible for the cells to function normally, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. most productive viral infections follow similar steps in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release ([link]). a virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or via glycoproteins embedded in the viral envelope. the specificity of this interaction determines the hostand the cells within the hostthat can be infected by a particular virus. this can be illustrated by thinking of several keys and several locks, where each key will fit only one specific lock. the nucleic acid of bacteriophages enters the host cell naked, leaving the capsid outside the cell. plant and animal viruses can enter through endocytosis, in which the cell membrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus. some enveloped viruses enter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly with the cell membrane. once inside the cell, the viral capsid is degraded, and the viral nucleic acid is released, which then becomes available for replication and transcription. the replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. dna viruses usually use host cell proteins and enzymes to make additional dna that is transcribed to messenger rna (mrna), which is then used to direct protein synthesis. rna viruses usually use the rna core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic rna and mrna. the viral mrna directs the host cell to synthesize viral enzymes and capsid proteins, and assemble new virions. of course, there are exceptions to this pattern. if a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral genes supply the information to direct synthesis of the missing proteins. retroviruses, such as hiv, have an rna genome that must be reverse transcribed into dna, which then is incorporated into the host cell genome. they are within group vi of the baltimore classification scheme. to convert rna into dna, retroviruses must contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse transcriptase that transcribes an rna template to dna. reverse transcription never occurs in uninfected host cellsthe needed enzyme reverse transcriptase is only derived from the expression of viral genes within the infected host cells. the fact that hiv produces some of its own enzymes not found in the host has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes. these drugs, including the reverse transcriptase inhibitor azt, inhibit hiv replication by reducing the activity of the enzyme without affecting the hosts metabolism. this approach has led to the development of a variety of drugs used to treat hiv and has been effective at reducing the number of infectious virions (copies of viral rna) in the blood to non-detectable levels in many hiv-infected individuals. the last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions produced in the host organism, where they are able to infect adjacent cells and repeat the replication cycle. as youve learned, some viruses are released when the host cell dies, and other viruses can leave infected cells by budding through the membrane without directly killing the cell. as youve learned, viruses are often very specific as to which hosts and which cells within the host they will infect. this feature of a virus makes it specific to one or a few species of life on earth. on the other hand, so many different types of viruses exist on earth that nearly every living organism has its own set of viruses that tries to infect its cells. even the smallest and simplest of cells, prokaryotic bacteria, may be attacked by specific types of viruses. bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria ([link]). when infection of a cell by a bacteriophage results in the production of new virions, the infection is said to be productive. if the virions are released by bursting the cell, the virus replicates by means of a lytic cycle ([link]). an example of a lytic bacteriophage is t4, which infects escherichia coli found in the human intestinal tract. sometimes, however, a virus can remain within the cell without being released. for example, when a temperate bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, it replicates by means of a lysogenic cycle ([link]), and the viral genome is incorporated into the genome of the host cell. when the phage dna is incorporated into the host cell genome, it is called a prophage. an example of a lysogenic bacteriophage is the  (lambda) virus, which also infects the e. coli bacterium. viruses that infect plant or animal cells may also undergo infections where they are not producing virions for long periods. an example is the animal herpesviruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the cause of oral and genital herpes in humans. in a process called latency, these viruses can exist in nervous tissue for long periods of time without producing new virions, only to leave latency periodically and cause lesions in the skin where the virus replicates. even though there are similarities between lysogeny and latency, the term lysogenic cycle is usually reserved to describe bacteriophages. latency will be described in more detail below. animal viruses, unlike the viruses of plants and bacteria, do not have to penetrate a cell wall to gain access to the host cell. non-enveloped or naked animal viruses may enter cells in two different ways. as a protein in the viral capsid binds to its receptor on the host cell, the virus may be taken inside the cell via a vesicle during the normal cell process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. an alternative method of cell penetration used by non-enveloped viruses is for capsid proteins to undergo shape changes after binding to the receptor, creating channels in the host cell membrane. the viral genome is then injected into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages. enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors: receptor-mediated endocytosis, or fusion. many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non-enveloped viruses. on the other hand, fusion only occurs with enveloped virions. these viruses, which include hiv among others, use special fusion proteins in their envelopes to cause the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, thus releasing the genome and capsid of the virus into the cell cytoplasm.	 after making their proteins and copying their genomes, animal viruses complete the assembly of new virions and exit the cell. as we have already discussed using the example of hiv, enveloped animal viruses may bud from the cell membrane as they assemble themselves, taking a piece of the cells plasma membrane in the process. on the other hand, non-enveloped viral progeny, such as rhinoviruses, accumulate in infected cells until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis, and all virions are released together.	 as you will learn in the next module, animal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases. some of them follow the classic pattern of acute disease, where symptoms get increasingly worse for a short period followed by the elimination of the virus from the body by the immune system and eventual recovery from the infection. examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza. other viruses cause long-term chronic infections, such as the virus causing hepatitis c, whereas others, like herpes simplex virus, only cause intermittent symptoms. still other viruses, such as human herpesviruses 6 and 7, which in some cases can cause the minor childhood disease roseola, often successfully cause productive infections without causing any symptoms at all in the host, and thus we say these patients have an asymptomatic infection. in hepatitis c infections, the virus grows and reproduces in liver cells, causing low levels of liver damage. the damage is so low that infected individuals are often unaware that they are infected, and many infections are detected only by routine blood work on patients with risk factors such as intravenous drug use. on the other hand, since many of the symptoms of viral diseases are caused by immune responses, a lack of symptoms is an indication of a weak immune response to the virus. this allows for the virus to escape elimination by the immune system and persist in individuals for years, all the while producing low levels of progeny virions in what is known as a chronic viral disease. chronic infection of the liver by this virus leads to a much greater chance of developing liver cancer, sometimes as much as 30 years after the initial infection. as already discussed, herpes simplex virus can remain in a state of latency in nervous tissue for months, even years. as the virus hides in the tissue and makes few if any viral proteins, there is nothing for the immune response to act against, and immunity to the virus slowly declines. under certain conditions, including various types of physical and psychological stress, the latent herpes simplex virus may be reactivated and undergo a lytic replication cycle in the skin, causing the lesions associated with the disease. once virions are produced in the skin and viral proteins are synthesized, the immune response is again stimulated and resolves the skin lesions in a few days by destroying viruses in the skin. as a result of this type of replicative cycle, appearances of cold sores and genital herpes outbreaks only occur intermittently, even though the viruses remain in the nervous tissue for life. latent infections are common with other herpesviruses as well, including the varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox. after having a chickenpox infection in childhood, the varicella-zoster virus can remain latent for many years and reactivate in adults to cause the painful condition known as shingles ([link]ab). some animal-infecting viruses, including the hepatitis c virus discussed above, are known as oncogenic viruses: they have the ability to cause cancer. these viruses interfere with the normal regulation of the host cell cycle either by either introducing genes that stimulate unregulated cell growth (oncogenes) or by interfering with the expression of genes that inhibit cell growth. oncogenic viruses can be either dna or rna viruses. cancers known to be associated with viral infections include cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus (hpv) ([link]), liver cancer caused by hepatitis b virus, t-cell leukemia, and several types of lymphoma. plant viruses, like other viruses, contain a core of either dna or rna. you have already learned about one of these, the tobacco mosaic virus. as plant cells have a cell wall to protect their cells, these viruses do not use receptor-mediated endocytosis to enter host cells as is seen with animal viruses. for many plant viruses to be transferred from plant to plant, damage to some of the plants cells must occur to allow the virus to enter a new host. this damage is often caused by weather, insects, animals, fire, or human activities like farming or landscaping. additionally, plant offspring may inherit viral diseases from parent plants. plant viruses can be transmitted by a variety of vectors, through contact with an infected plants sap, by living organisms such as insects and nematodes, and through pollen. when plants viruses are transferred between different plants, this is known as horizontal transmission, and when they are inherited from a parent, this is called vertical transmission. symptoms of viral diseases vary according to the virus and its host ([link]). one common symptom is hyperplasia, the abnormal proliferation of cells that causes the appearance of plant tumors known as galls. other viruses induce hypoplasia, or decreased cell growth, in the leaves of plants, causing thin, yellow areas to appear. still other viruses affect the plant by directly killing plant cells, a process known as cell necrosis. other symptoms of plant viruses include malformed leaves, black streaks on the stems of the plants, altered growth of stems, leaves, or fruits, and ring spots, which are circular or linear areas of discoloration found in a leaf. plant viruses can seriously disrupt crop growth and development, significantly affecting our food supply. they are responsible for poor crop quality and quantity globally, and can bring about huge economic losses annually. others viruses may damage plants used in landscaping. some viruses that infect agricultural food plants include the name of the plant they infect, such as tomato spotted wilt virus, bean common mosaic virus, and cucumber mosaic virus. in plants used for landscaping, two of the most common viruses are peony ring spot and rose mosaic virus. there are far too many plant viruses to discuss each in detail, but symptoms of bean common mosaic virus result in lowered bean production and stunted, unproductive plants. in the ornamental rose, the rose mosaic disease causes wavy yellow lines and colored splotches on the leaves of the plant. viral replication within a living cell always produces changes in the cell, sometimes resulting in cell death and sometimes slowly killing the infected cells. there are six basic stages in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release. a viral infection may be productive, resulting in new virions, or nonproductive, which means that the virus remains inside the cell without producing new virions. bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. they have two different modes of replication: the lytic cycle, where the virus replicates and bursts out of the bacteria, and the lysogenic cycle, which involves the incorporation of the viral genome into the bacterial host genome. animal viruses cause a variety of infections, with some causing chronic symptoms (hepatitis c), some intermittent symptoms (latent viruses such a herpes simplex virus 1), and others that cause very few symptoms, if any (human herpesviruses 6 and 7). oncogenic viruses in animals have the ability to cause cancer by interfering with the regulation of the host cell cycle. viruses of plants are responsible for significant economic damage in both agriculture and plants used for ornamentation.","[('viral assembly', 'viral

106,stax-bio,21,Viruses,3,m44599,Prevention and Treatment of Viral Infections,"viruses cause a variety of diseases in animals, including humans, ranging from the common cold to potentially fatal illnesses like meningitis ([link]). these diseases can be treated by antiviral drugs or by vaccines, but some viruses, such as hiv, are capable of both avoiding the immune response and mutating to become resistant to antiviral drugs. while we do have limited numbers of effective antiviral drugs, such as those used to treat hiv and influenza, the primary method of controlling viral disease is by vaccination, which is intended to prevent outbreaks by building immunity to a virus or virus family ([link]). vaccines may be prepared using live viruses, killed viruses, or molecular subunits of the virus. the killed viral vaccines and subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease. live viral vaccines are designed in the laboratory to cause few symptoms in recipients while giving them protective immunity against future infections. polio was one disease that represented a milestone in the use of vaccines. mass immunization campaigns in the 1950s (killed vaccine) and 1960s (live vaccine) significantly reduced the incidence of the disease, which caused muscle paralysis in children and generated a great amount of fear in the general population when regional epidemics occurred. the success of the polio vaccine paved the way for the routine dispensation of childhood vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and other diseases. the danger of using live vaccines, which are usually more effective than killed vaccines, is the low but significant danger that these viruses will revert to their disease-causing form by back mutations. live vaccines are usually made by attenuating (weakening) the wild-type (disease-causing) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host. adaptations to these new cells or temperatures induce mutations in the genomes of the virus, allowing it to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting its ability to cause disease when reintroduced into conditions found in the host. these attenuated viruses thus still cause infection, but they do not grow very well, allowing the immune response to develop in time to prevent major disease. back mutations occur when the vaccine undergoes mutations in the host such that it readapts to the host and can again cause disease, which can then be spread to other humans in an epidemic. this type of scenario happened as recently as 2007 in nigeria where mutations in a polio vaccine led to an epidemic of polio in that country. some vaccines are in continuous development because certain viruses, such as influenza and hiv, have a high mutation rate compared to other viruses and normal host cells. with influenza, mutations in the surface molecules of the virus help the organism evade the protective immunity that may have been obtained in a previous influenza season, making it necessary for individuals to get vaccinated every year. other viruses, such as those that cause the childhood diseases measles, mumps, and rubella, mutate so infrequently that the same vaccine is used year after year. in some cases, vaccines can be used to treat an active viral infection. the concept behind this is that by giving the vaccine, immunity is boosted without adding more disease-causing virus. in the case of rabies, a fatal neurological disease transmitted via the saliva of rabies virus-infected animals, the progression of the disease from the time of the animal bite to the time it enters the central nervous system may be 2 weeks or longer. this is enough time to vaccinate an individual who suspects that they have been bitten by a rabid animal, and their boosted immune response is sufficient to prevent the virus from entering nervous tissue. thus, the potentially fatal neurological consequences of the disease are averted, and the individual only has to recover from the infected bite. this approach is also being used for the treatment of ebola, one of the fastest and most deadly viruses on earth. transmitted by bats and great apes, this disease can cause death in 7090 percent of infected humans within 2 weeks. using newly developed vaccines that boost the immune response in this way, there is hope that affected individuals will be better able to control the virus, potentially saving a greater percentage of infected persons from a rapid and very painful death. another way of treating viral infections is the use of antiviral drugs. these drugs often have limited success in curing viral disease, but in many cases, they have been used to control and reduce symptoms for a wide variety of viral diseases. for most viruses, these drugs can inhibit the virus by blocking the actions of one or more of its proteins. it is important that the targeted proteins be encoded by viral genes and that these molecules are not present in a healthy host cell. in this way, viral growth is inhibited without damaging the host. there are large numbers of antiviral drugs available to treat infections, some specific for a particular virus and others that can affect multiple viruses. antivirals have been developed to treat genital herpes (herpes simplex ii) and influenza. for genital herpes, drugs such as acyclovir can reduce the number and duration of episodes of active viral disease, during which patients develop viral lesions in their skin cells. as the virus remains latent in nervous tissue of the body for life, this drug is not curative but can make the symptoms of the disease more manageable. for influenza, drugs like tamiflu (oseltamivir) ([link]) can reduce the duration of flu symptoms by 1 or 2 days, but the drug does not prevent symptoms entirely. tamiflu works by inhibiting an enzyme (viral neuraminidase) that allows new virions to leave their infected cells. thus, tamiflu inhibits the spread of virus from infected to uninfected cells. other antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin, have been used to treat a variety of viral infections, although its mechanism of action against certain viruses remains unclear. by far, the most successful use of antivirals has been in the treatment of the retrovirus hiv, which causes a disease that, if untreated, is usually fatal within 1012 years after infection. anti-hiv drugs have been able to control viral replication to the point that individuals receiving these drugs survive for a significantly longer time than the untreated. anti-hiv drugs inhibit viral replication at many different phases of the hiv replicative cycle ([link]). drugs have been developed that inhibit the fusion of the hiv viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell (fusion inhibitors), the conversion of its rna genome into double-stranded dna (reverse transcriptase inhibitors), the integration of the viral dna into the host genome (integrase inhibitors), and the processing of viral proteins (protease inhibitors). when any of these drugs are used individually, the high mutation rate of the virus allows it to easily and rapidly develop resistance to the drug, limiting the drugs effectiveness. the breakthrough in the treatment of hiv was the development of haart, highly active anti-retroviral therapy, which involves a mixture of different drugs, sometimes called a drug cocktail. by attacking the virus at different stages of its replicative cycle, it is much more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to multiple drugs at the same time. still, even with the use of combination haart therapy, there is concern that, over time, the virus will develop resistance to this therapy. thus, new anti-hiv drugs are constantly being developed with the hope of continuing the battle against this highly fatal virus. applied virology
the study of viruses has led to the development of a variety of new ways to treat non-viral diseases. viruses have been used in gene therapy. gene therapy is used to treat genetic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (scid), a heritable, recessive disease in which children are born with severely compromised immune systems. one common type of scid is due to the lack of an enzyme, adenosine deaminase (ada), which breaks down purine bases. to treat this disease by gene therapy, bone marrow cells are taken from a scid patient and the ada gene is inserted. this is where viruses come in, and their use relies on their ability to penetrate living cells and bring genes in with them. viruses such as adenovirus, an upper respiratory human virus, are modified by the addition of the ada gene, and the virus then transports this gene into the cell. the modified cells, now capable of making ada, are then given back to the patients in the hope of curing them. gene therapy using viruses as carrier of genes (viral vectors), although still experimental, holds promise for the treatment of many genetic diseases. still, many technological problems need to be solved for this approach to be a viable method for treating genetic disease. another medical use for viruses relies on their specificity and ability to kill the cells they infect. oncolytic viruses are engineered in the laboratory specifically to attack and kill cancer cells. a genetically modified adenovirus known as h101 has been used since 2005 in clinical trials in china to treat head and neck cancers. the results have been promising, with a greater short-term response rate to the combination of chemotherapy and viral therapy than to chemotherapy treatment alone. this ongoing research may herald the beginning of a new age of cancer therapy, where viruses are engineered to find and specifically kill cancer cells, regardless of where in the body they may have spread. a third use of viruses in medicine relies on their specificity and involves using bacteriophages in the treatment of bacterial infections. bacterial diseases have been treated with antibiotics since the 1940s. however, over time, many bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics. a good example is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, pronounced mersa), an infection commonly acquired in hospitals. this bacterium is resistant to a variety of antibiotics, making it difficult to treat. the use of bacteriophages specific for such bacteria would bypass their resistance to antibiotics and specifically kill them. although phage therapy is in use in the republic of georgia to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, its use to treat human diseases has not been approved in most countries. however, the safety of the treatment was confirmed in the united states when the u.s. food and drug administration approved spraying meats with bacteriophages to destroy the food pathogen listeria. as more and more antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria evolve, the use of bacteriophages might be a potential solution to the problem, and the development of phage therapy is of much interest to researchers worldwide. viruses cause a variety of diseases in humans. many of these diseases can be prevented by the use of viral vaccines, which stimulate protective immunity against the virus without causing major disease. viral vaccines may also be used in active viral infections, boosting the ability of the immune system to control or destroy the virus. a series of antiviral drugs that target enzymes and other protein products of viral genes have been developed and used with mixed success. combinations of anti-hiv drugs have been used to effectively control the virus, extending the lifespans of infected individuals. viruses have many uses in medicines, such as in the treatment of genetic disorders, cancer, and bacterial infections.","[('antiviral drug', 'antiviral drugs'), ('virology', 'virologies'), ('gene therapy', 'gene therapies'), ('killed vaccine', 'killed vaccines'), ('phage therapy', 'phage therapies'), ('back mutation', 'back mutations'), ('vaccine', 'vaccines'), ('hiv', 'hivs'), ('vaccination', 'vaccinations'), ('live vaccine', 'live vaccines'), ('oncolytic viru', 'oncolytic viruss', 'oncolytic virus'), ('attenuating', 'attenuatings')]"
107,stax-bio,21,Viruses,4,m44601,Other Acellular Entities: Prions and Viroids,"prions and viroids are pathogens (agents with the ability to cause disease) that have simpler structures than viruses but, in the case of prions, still can produce deadly diseases. prions, so-called because they are proteinaceous, are infectious particlessmaller than virusesthat contain no nucleic acids (neither dna nor rna). historically, the idea of an infectious agent that did not use nucleic acids was considered impossible, but pioneering work by nobel prize-winning biologist stanley prusiner has convinced the majority of biologists that such agents do indeed exist. fatal neurodegenerative diseases, such as kuru in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse) in cattle (commonly known as mad cow disease) were shown to be transmitted by prions. the disease was spread by the consumption of meat, nervous tissue, or internal organs between members of the same species. kuru, native to humans in papua new guinea, was spread from human to human via ritualistic cannibalism. bse, originally detected in the united kingdom, was spread between cattle by the practice of including cattle nervous tissue in feed for other cattle. individuals with kuru and bse show symptoms of loss of motor control and unusual behaviors, such as uncontrolled bursts of laughter with kuru, followed by death. kuru was controlled by inducing the population to abandon its ritualistic cannibalism. on the other hand, bse was initially thought to only affect cattle. cattle dying of the disease were shown to have developed lesions or holes in the brain, causing the brain tissue to resemble a sponge. later on in the outbreak, however, it was shown that a similar encephalopathy in humans known as variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease (cjd) could be acquired from eating beef from animals with bse, sparking bans by various countries on the importation of british beef and causing considerable economic damage to the british beef industry ([link]). bse still exists in various areas, and although a rare disease, individuals that acquire cjd are difficult to treat. the disease can be spread from human to human by blood, so many countries have banned blood donation from regions associated with bse.	 the cause of spongiform encephalopathies, such as kuru and bse, is an infectious structural variant of a normal cellular protein called prp (prion protein). it is this variant that constitutes the prion particle. prp exists in two forms, prpc, the normal form of the protein, and prpsc, the infectious form. once introduced into the body, the prpsc  contained within the prion binds to prpc and converts it to prpsc. this leads to an exponential increase of the prpsc protein, which aggregates.  prpsc is folded abnormally, and the resulting conformation (shape) is directly responsible for the lesions seen in the brains of infected cattle. thus, although not without some detractors among scientists, the prion seems likely to be an entirely new form of infectious agent, the first one found whose transmission is not reliant upon genes made of dna or rna. viroids are plant pathogens: small, single-stranded, circular rna particles that are much simpler than a virus. they do not have a capsid or outer envelope, but like viruses can reproduce only within a host cell. viroids do not, however, manufacture any proteins, and they only produce a single, specific rna molecule. human diseases caused by viroids have yet to be identified. viroids are known to infect plants ([link]) and are responsible for crop failures and the loss of millions of dollars in agricultural revenue each year. some of the plants they infect include potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, chrysanthemums, avocados, and coconut palms. virologist  
virology is the study of viruses, and a virologist is an individual trained in this discipline. training in virology can lead to many different career paths. virologists are actively involved in academic research and teaching in colleges and medical schools. some virologists treat patients or are involved in the generation and production of vaccines. they might participate in epidemiologic studies ([link]) or become science writers, to name just a few possible careers. if you think you may be interested in a career in virology, find a mentor in the field. many large medical centers have departments of virology, and smaller hospitals usually have virology labs within their microbiology departments. volunteer in a virology lab for a semester or work in one over the summer. discussing the profession and getting a first-hand look at the work will help you decide whether a career in virology is right for you. the american society of virologys website is a good resource for information regarding training and careers in virology. prions are infectious agents that consist of protein, but no dna or rna, and seem to produce their deadly effects by duplicating their shapes and accumulating in tissues. they are thought to contribute to several progressive brain disorders, including mad cow disease and creutzfeldt-jakob disease. viroids are single-stranded rna pathogens that infect plants. their presence can have a severe impact on the agriculture industry.","[('prp', 'prps'), ('pathogen', 'pathogenss', 'pathogens'), ('viroid', 'viroidss', 'viroids'), ('prion protein', 'prion proteins'), ('virologist', 'virologists'), ('prion', 'prionss', 'prions')]"
108,stax-bio,22,Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea,0,m44602,Introduction,"in the recent past, scientists grouped living things into five kingdomsanimals, plants, fungi, protists, and prokaryotesbased on several criteria, such as the absence or presence of a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, the absence or presence of cell walls, multicellularity, and so on. in the late 20th century, the pioneering work of carl woese and others compared sequences of small-subunit ribosomal rna (ssu rrna), which resulted in a more fundamental way to group organisms on earth. based on differences in the structure of cell membranes and in rrna, woese and his colleagues proposed that all life on earth evolved along three lineages, called domains. the domain bacteria comprises all organisms in the kingdom bacteria, the domain archaea comprises the rest of the prokaryotes, and the domain eukarya comprises all eukaryotesincluding organisms in the kingdoms animalia, plantae, fungi, and protista. two of the three domainsbacteria and archaeaare prokaryotic. prokaryotes were the first inhabitants on earth, appearing 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. these organisms are abundant and ubiquitous; that is, they are present everywhere. in addition to inhabiting moderate environments, they are found in extreme conditions: from boiling springs to permanently frozen environments in antarctica; from salty environments like the dead sea to environments under tremendous pressure, such as the depths of the ocean; and from areas without oxygen, such as a waste management plant, to radioactively contaminated regions, such as chernobyl. prokaryotes reside in the human digestive system and on the skin, are responsible for certain illnesses, and serve an important role in the preparation of many foods.","[('radioresistant', 'radioresistants'), ('microbial mat', 'microbial mats'), ('carbon cycle', 'carbon cycles'), ('psychrophile', 'psychrophiles'), ('gram positive', 'gram positives'), ('bacterium', 'bacterias', 'bacteria'), ('acidophile', 'acidophiles'), ('prokaryotic diversity', 'prokaryotic diversities'), ('capsule', 'capsules'), ('plasma membrane', 'plasma membranes'), ('biotechnology', 'biotechnologies'), ('anoxic', 'anoxics'), ('nutrient', 'nutrients'), ('resuscitation', 'resuscitations'), ('ancient atmosphere', 'ancient atmospheres'), ('anaerobic', 'anaerobics'), ('teichoic acid', 'teichoic acids'), ('phototroph', 'phototrophs'), ('botulism', 'botulisms'), ('decomposer', 'decomposers'), ('biological nitrogen fixation', 'biological nitrogen fixations', 'biological nitrogens fixation', 'biological nitrogens fixations'), ('superbug', 'superbugs'), ('nitrogen fixation', 'nitrogen fixations'), ('antibiotic resistance', 'antibiotic resistances'), ('prokaryote', 'prokaryotes'), ('endemic disease', 'endemic diseases'), ('carbon', 'carbons'), ('peptidoglycan', 'peptidoglycans'), ('pandemic', 'pandemics'), ('viable-but-non-culturable state', 'viable-but-non-culturable state'), ('microbiologist', 'microbiologists'), ('black death', 'black deaths'), ('bacterial disease', 'bacterial diseases'), ('prokaryote metabolism', 'prokaryote metabolisms'), ('disease migration', 'disease migrations'), ('dead sea', 'dead seas'), ('nitrification', 'nitrifications'), ('conjugation', 'conjugations'), ('halophile', 'halophiles'), ('epidemiologist', 'epidemiologists'), ('antibiotic', 'antibiotics'), ('unculturable prokaryote', 'unculturable prokaryotes'), ('hyperthermophile', 'hyperthermophiles'), ('extremophile', 'extremophiles'), ('archaea', 'archaeas'), ('stromatolite', 'stromatolites'), ('chemotroph', 'chemotrophs'), ('zoonosi', 'zoonoses', 'zoonosis'), ('denitrification', 'denitrifications'), ('mrsa', 'mrsas'), ('prokaryotic metabolism', 'prokaryotic metabolisms'), ('hydrothermal vent', 'hydrothermal vents'), ('epidemic', 'epidemics'), ('alkaliphile', 'alkaliphiles'), ('prokaryote evolution', 'prokaryote evolutions'), ('thermophile', 'thermophiles'), ('bubonic plague', 'bubonic plagues'), ('plague of athen', 'plague of athens', 'plague of athens', 'plagues of athen', 'plagues of athens', 'plagues of athens'), ('transduction', 'transductions'), ('cyanobacterium', 'cyanobacterias', 'cyanobacteria'), ('ca-mrsa', 'ca-mrsas'), ('prokaryote energy', 'prokaryote energies'), ('foodborne disease', 'foodborne diseases'), ('osmophile', 'osmophiles'), ('cell wall', 'cell walls'), ('gram negative', 'gram negatives'), ('prokaryote reproduction', 'prokaryote reproductions'), ('emerging disease', 'emerging diseases'), ('s-layer', 's-layers'), ('prokaryotic cell', 'prokaryotic cells'), ('biofilm', 'biofilms'), ('ecosystem', 'ecosystems'), ('macronutrient', 'macronutrients'), ('vbnc state', 'vbnc states'), ('nodule', 'nodules'), ('bioremediation', 'bioremediations'), ('nitrogen cycle', 'nitrogen cycles'), ('micronutrient', 'micronutrients')]"
109,stax-bio,22,Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea,1,m44603,Prokaryotic Diversity,"prokaryotes are ubiquitous. they cover every imaginable surface where there is sufficient moisture, and they live on and inside of other living things. in the typical human body, prokaryotic cells outnumber human body cells by about ten to one. they comprise the majority of living things in all ecosystems. some prokaryotes thrive in environments that are inhospitable for most living things. prokaryotes recycle nutrientsessential substances (such as carbon and nitrogen)and they drive the evolution of new ecosystems, some of which are natural and others man-made. prokaryotes have been on earth since long before multicellular life appeared. when and where did life begin? what were the conditions on earth when life began? prokaryotes were the first forms of life on earth, and they existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. the earth and its moon are thought to be about 4.54billion years old. this estimate is based on evidence from radiometric dating of meteorite material together with other substrate material from earth and the moon. early earth had a very different atmosphere (contained less molecular oxygen) than it does today and was subjected to strong radiation; thus, the first organisms would have flourished where they were more protected, such as in ocean depths or beneath the surface of the earth. at this time too, strong volcanic activity was common on earth, so it is likely that these first organismsthe first prokaryoteswere adapted to very high temperatures. early earth was prone to geological upheaval and volcanic eruption, and was subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation from the sun. the first organisms were prokaryotes that could withstand these harsh conditions. microbial mats or large biofilms may represent the earliest forms of life on earth; there is fossil evidence of their presence starting about 3.5 billion years ago. a microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes ([link]) that includes mostly bacteria, but also archaea. microbial mats are a few centimeters thick, and they typically grow where different types of materials interface, mostly on moist surfaces. the various types of prokaryotes that comprise them carry out different metabolic pathways, and that is the reason for their various colors. prokaryotes in a microbial mat are held together by a glue-like sticky substance that they secrete called extracellular matrix. the first microbial mats likely obtained their energy from chemicals found near hydrothermal vents. a hydrothermal vent is a breakage or fissure in the earths surface that releases geothermally heated water. with the evolution of photosynthesis about 3 billion years ago, some prokaryotes in microbial mats came to use a more widely available energy sourcesunlightwhereas others were still dependent on chemicals from hydrothermal vents for energy and food. fossilized microbial mats represent the earliest record of life on earth. a stromatolite is a sedimentary structure formed when minerals are precipitated out of water by prokaryotes in a microbial mat ([link]). stromatolites form layered rocks made of carbonate or silicate. although most stromatolites are artifacts from the past, there are places on earth where stromatolites are still forming. for example, growing stromatolites have been found in the anza-borrego desert state park in san diego county, california. evidence indicates that during the first two billion years of earths existence, the atmosphere was anoxic, meaning that there was no molecular oxygen. therefore, only those organisms that can grow without oxygenanaerobic organismswere able to live. autotrophic organisms that convert solar energy into chemical energy are called phototrophs, and they appeared within one billion years of the formation of earth. then, cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, evolved from these simple phototrophs one billion years later. cyanobacteria ([link]) began the oxygenation of the atmosphere. increased atmospheric oxygen allowed the development of more efficient o2-utilizing catabolic pathways. it also opened up the land to increased colonization, because some o2 is converted into o3 (ozone) and ozone effectively absorbs the ultraviolet light that would otherwise cause lethal mutations in dna. ultimately, the increase in o2 concentrations allowed the evolution of other life forms. some organisms have developed strategies that allow them to survive harsh conditions. prokaryotes thrive in a vast array of environments: some grow in conditions that would seem very normal to us, whereas others are able to thrive and grow under conditions that would kill a plant or animal. almost all prokaryotes have a cell wall, a protective structure that allows them to survive in both hyper- and hypo-osmotic conditions. some soil bacteria are able to form endospores that resist heat and drought, thereby allowing the organism to survive until favorable conditions recur. these adaptations, along with others, allow bacteria to be the most abundant life form in all terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. other bacteria and archaea are adapted to grow under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles, meaning lovers of extremes. extremophiles have been found in all kinds of environments: the depth of the oceans, hot springs, the artic and the antarctic, in very dry places, deep inside earth, in harsh chemical environments, and in high radiation environments ([link]), just to mention a few. these organisms give us a better understanding of prokaryotic diversity and open up the possibility of finding new prokaryotic species that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic drugs or have industrial applications. because they have specialized adaptations that allow them to live in extreme conditions, many extremophiles cannot survive in moderate environments. there are many different groups of extremophiles: they are identified based on the conditions in which they grow best, and several habitats are extreme in multiple ways. for example, a soda lake is both salty and alkaline, so organisms that live in a soda lake must be both alkaliphiles and halophiles ([link]). other extremophiles, like radioresistant organisms, do not prefer an extreme environment (in this case, one with high levels of radiation), but have adapted to survive in it ([link]). one example of a very harsh environment is the dead sea, a hypersaline basin that is located between jordan and israel. hypersaline environments are essentially concentrated seawater. in the dead sea, the sodium concentration is 10 times higher than that of seawater, and the water contains high levels of magnesium (about 40 times higher than in seawater) that would be toxic to most living things. iron, calcium, and magnesium, elements that form divalent ions (fe2+, ca2+, and mg2+), produce what is commonly referred to as hard water. taken together, the high concentration of divalent cations, the acidic ph (6.0), and the intense solar radiation flux make the dead sea a unique, and uniquely hostile, ecosystem1 ([link]). what sort of prokaryotes do we find in the dead sea? the extremely salt-tolerant bacterial mats include halobacterium, haloferax volcanii (which is found in other locations, not only the dead sea), halorubrum sodomense, and halobaculum gomorrense, and the archaea haloarcula marismortui, among others. microbiologists typically grow prokaryotes in the laboratory using an appropriate culture medium containing all the nutrients needed by the target organism. the medium can be liquid, broth, or solid. after an incubation time at the right temperature, there should be evidence of microbial growth ([link]). the process of culturing bacteria is complex and is one of the greatest discoveries of modern science. german physician robert koch is credited with discovering the techniques for pure culture, including staining and using growth media. his assistant julius petri invented the petri dish whose use persists in todays laboratories. koch worked primarily with the mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium that causes tuberculosis and developed postulates to identify disease-causing organisms that continue to be widely used in the medical community. kochs postulates include that an organism can be identified as the cause of disease when it is present in all infected samples and absent in all healthy samples, and it is able to reproduce the infection after being cultured multiple times. today, cultures remain a primary diagnostic tool in medicine and other areas of molecular biology. some prokaryotes, however, cannot grow in a laboratory setting. in fact, over 99 percent of bacteria and archaea are unculturable. for the most part, this is due to a lack of knowledge as to what to feed these organisms and how to grow them; they have special requirements for growth that remain unknown to scientists, such as needing specific micronutrients, ph, temperature, pressure, co-factors, or co-metabolites. some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular parasites and cannot be grown outside a host cell. in other cases, culturable organisms become unculturable under stressful conditions, even though the same organism could be cultured previously. those organisms that cannot be cultured but are not dead are in a viable-but-non-culturable (vbnc) state. the vbnc state occurs when prokaryotes respond to environmental stressors by entering a dormant state that allows their survival. the criteria for entering into the vbnc state are not completely understood. in a process called resuscitation, the prokaryote can go back to normal life when environmental conditions improve. is the vbnc state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes? in fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic waters are non-culturable. it has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured under laboratory conditions. if these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive? microbiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), to amplify selected portions of dna of prokaryotes, demonstrating their existence. recall that pcr can make billions of copies of a dna segment in a process called amplification. until a couple of decades ago, microbiologists used to think of prokaryotes as isolated entities living apart. this model, however, does not reflect the true ecology of prokaryotes, most of which prefer to live in communities where they can interact. a biofilm is a microbial community ([link]) held together in a gummy-textured matrix that consists primarily of polysaccharides secreted by the organisms, together with some proteins and nucleic acids. biofilms grow attached to surfaces. some of the best-studied biofilms are composed of prokaryotes, although fungal biofilms have also been described as well as some composed of a mixture of fungi and bacteria. biofilms are present almost everywhere: they can cause the clogging of pipes and readily colonize surfaces in industrial settings. in recent, large-scale outbreaks of bacterial contamination of food, biofilms have played a major role. they also colonize household surfaces, such as kitchen counters, cutting boards, sinks, and toilets, as well as places on the human body, such as the surfaces of our teeth. interactions among the organisms that populate a biofilm, together with their protective exopolysaccharidic (eps) environment, make these communities more robust than free-living, or planktonic, prokaryotes. the sticky substance that holds bacteria together also excludes most antibiotics and disinfectants, making biofilm bacteria hardier than their planktonic counterparts. overall, biofilms are very difficult to destroy because they are resistant to many common forms of sterilization. prokaryotes existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. hot springs and hydrothermal vents may have been the environments in which life began. microbial mats are thought to represent the earliest forms of life on earth, and there is fossil evidence of their presence about 3.5 billion years ago. a microbial mat is a multi-layered sheet of prokaryotes that grows at interfaces between different types of material, mostly on moist surfaces. during the first 2 billion years, the atmosphere was anoxic and only anaerobic organisms were able to live. cyanobacteria evolved from early phototrophs and began the oxygenation of the atmosphere. the increase in oxygen concentration allowed the evolution of other life forms. fossilized microbial mats are called stromatolites and consist of laminated organo-sedimentary structures formed by precipitation of minerals by prokaryotes. they represent the earliest fossil record of life on earth. bacteria and archaea grow in virtually every environment. those that survive under extreme conditions are called extremophiles (extreme lovers). some prokaryotes cannot grow in a laboratory setting, but they are not dead. they are in the viable-but-non-culturable (vbnc) state. the vbnc state occurs when prokaryotes enter a dormant state in response to environmental stressors. most prokaryotes are social and prefer to live in communities where interactions take place. a biofilm is a microbial community held together in a gummy-textured matrix.","[('radioresistant', 'radioresistants'), ('phototroph', 'phototrophs'), ('microbial mat', 'microbial mats'), ('bacterium',

110,stax-bio,22,Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea,2,m44605,Structure of Prokaryotes,"there are many differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. however, all cells have four common structures: the plasma membrane, which functions as a barrier for the cell and separates the cell from its environment; the cytoplasm, a jelly-like substance inside the cell; nucleic acids, the genetic material of the cell; and ribosomes, where protein synthesis takes place. prokaryotes come in various shapes, but many fall into three categories: cocci (spherical), bacilli (rod-shaped), and spirilli (spiral-shaped) ([link]). recall that prokaryotes ([link]) are unicellular organisms that lack organelles or other internal membrane-bound structures. therefore, they do not have a nucleus but instead generally have a single chromosomea piece of circular, double-stranded dna located in an area of the cell called the nucleoid. most prokaryotes have a cell wall outside the plasma membrane. recall that prokaryotes are divided into two different domains, bacteria and archaea, which together with eukarya, comprise the three domains of life ([link]). the composition of the cell wall differs significantly between the domains bacteria and archaea. the composition of their cell walls also differs from the eukaryotic cell walls found in plants (cellulose) or fungi and insects (chitin). the cell wall functions as a protective layer, and it is responsible for the organisms shape. some bacteria have an outer capsule outside the cell wall. other structures are present in some prokaryotic species, but not in others ([link]). for example, the capsule found in some species enables the organism to attach to surfaces, protects it from dehydration and attack by phagocytic cells, and makes pathogens more resistant to our immune responses. some species also have flagella (singular, flagellum) used for locomotion, and pili (singular, pilus) used for attachment to surfaces. plasmids, which consist of extra-chromosomal dna, are also present in many species of bacteria and archaea. characteristics of phyla of bacteria are described in [link] and [link]; archaea are described in [link]. the plasma membrane is a thin lipid bilayer (6 to 8 nanometers) that completely surrounds the cell and separates the inside from the outside. its selectively permeable nature keeps ions, proteins, and other molecules within the cell and prevents them from diffusing into the extracellular environment, while other molecules may move through the membrane. recall that the general structure of a cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer composed of two layers of lipid molecules. in archaeal cell membranes, isoprene (phytanyl) chains linked to glycerol replace the fatty acids linked to glycerol in bacterial membranes. some archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers ([link]). the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells has a high concentration of dissolved solutes. therefore, the osmotic pressure within the cell is relatively high. the cell wall is a protective layer that surrounds some cells and gives them shape and rigidity. it is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis (bursting due to increasing volume). the chemical composition of the cell walls varies between archaea and bacteria, and also varies between bacterial species. bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan, composed of polysaccharide chains that are cross-linked by unusual peptides containing both l- and d-amino acids including d-glutamic acid and d-alanine. proteins normally have only l-amino acids; as a consequence, many of our antibiotics work by mimicking d-amino acids and therefore have specific effects on bacterial cell wall development. there are more than 100 different forms of peptidoglycan. s-layer (surface layer) proteins are also present on the outside of cell walls of both archaea and bacteria. bacteria are divided into two major groups: gram positive and gram negative, based on their reaction to gram staining. note that all gram-positive bacteria belong to one phylum; bacteria in the other phyla (proteobacteria, chlamydias, spirochetes, cyanobacteria, and others) are gram-negative. the gram staining method is named after its inventor, danish scientist hans christian gram (18531938). the different bacterial responses to the staining procedure are ultimately due to cell wall structure. gram-positive organisms typically lack the outer membrane found in gram-negative organisms ([link]). up to 90 percent of the cell wall in gram-positive bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan, and most of the rest is composed of acidic substances called teichoic acids. teichoic acids may be covalently linked to lipids in the plasma membrane to form lipoteichoic acids. lipoteichoic acids anchor the cell wall to the cell membrane. gram-negative bacteria have a relatively thin cell wall composed of a few layers of peptidoglycan (only 10 percent of the total cell wall), surrounded by an outer envelope containing lipopolysaccharides (lps) and lipoproteins. this outer envelope is sometimes referred to as a second lipid bilayer. the chemistry of this outer envelope is very different, however, from that of the typical lipid bilayer that forms plasma membranes. archaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan. there are four different types of archaean cell walls. one type is composed of pseudopeptidoglycan, which is similar to peptidoglycan in morphology but contains different sugars in the polysaccharide chain. the other three types of cell walls are composed of polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or pure protein. reproduction in prokaryotes is asexual and usually takes place by binary fission. recall that the dna of a prokaryote exists as a single, circular chromosome. prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis. rather the chromosome is replicated and the two resulting copies separate from one another, due to the growth of the cell. the prokaryote, now enlarged, is pinched inward at its equator and the two resulting cells, which are clones, separate. binary fission does not provide an opportunity for genetic recombination or genetic diversity, but prokaryotes can share genes by three other mechanisms. in transformation, the prokaryote takes in dna found in its environment that is shed by other prokaryotes. if a nonpathogenic bacterium takes up dna for a toxin gene from a pathogen and incorporates the new dna into its own chromosome, it too may become pathogenic. in transduction, bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, sometimes also move short pieces of chromosomal dna from one bacterium to another. transduction results in a recombinant organism. archaea are not affected by bacteriophages but instead have their own viruses that translocate genetic material from one individual to another. in conjugation, dna is transferred from one prokaryote to another by means of a pilus, which brings the organisms into contact with one another. the dna transferred can be in the form of a plasmid or as a hybrid, containing both plasmid and chromosomal dna. these three processes of dna exchange are shown in [link]. reproduction can be very rapid: a few minutes for some species. this short generation time coupled with mechanisms of genetic recombination and high rates of mutation result in the rapid evolution of prokaryotes, allowing them to respond to environmental changes (such as the introduction of an antibiotic) very quickly. the evolution of prokaryoteshow do scientists answer questions about the evolution of prokaryotes? unlike with animals, artifacts in the fossil record of prokaryotes offer very little information. fossils of ancient prokaryotes look like tiny bubbles in rock. some scientists turn to genetics and to the principle of the molecular clock, which holds that the more recently two species have diverged, the more similar their genes (and thus proteins) will be. conversely, species that diverged long ago will have more genes that are dissimilar. scientists at the nasa astrobiology institute and at the european molecular biology laboratory collaborated to analyze the molecular evolution of 32 specific proteins common to 72 species of prokaryotes.1 the model they derived from their data indicates that three important groups of bacteriaactinobacteria, deinococcus, and cyanobacteria (which the authors call terrabacteria)were the first to colonize land. (recall that deinococcus is a genus of prokaryotea bacteriumthat is highly resistant to ionizing radiation.) cyanobacteria are photosynthesizers, while actinobacteria are a group of very common bacteria that include species important in decomposition of organic wastes. the timelines of divergence suggest that bacteria (members of the domain bacteria) diverged from common ancestral species between 2.5 and 3.2 billion years ago, whereas archaea diverged earlier: between 3.1 and 4.1 billion years ago. eukarya later diverged off the archaean line. the work further suggests that stromatolites that formed prior to the advent of cyanobacteria (about 2.6 billion years ago) photosynthesized in an anoxic environment and that because of the modifications of the terrabacteria for land (resistance to drying and the possession of compounds that protect the organism from excess light), photosynthesis using oxygen may be closely linked to adaptations to survive on land. prokaryotes (domains archaea and bacteria) are single-celled organisms lacking a nucleus. they have a single piece of circular dna in the nucleoid area of the cell. most prokaryotes have a cell wall that lies outside the boundary of the plasma membrane. some prokaryotes may have additional structures such as a capsule, flagella, and pili. bacteria and archaea differ in the lipid composition of their cell membranes and the characteristics of the cell wall. in archaeal membranes, phytanyl units, rather than fatty acids, are linked to glycerol. some archaeal membranes are lipid monolayers instead of bilayers. the cell wall is located outside the cell membrane and prevents osmotic lysis. the chemical composition of cell walls varies between species. bacterial cell walls contain peptidoglycan. archaean cell walls do not have peptidoglycan, but they may have pseudopeptidoglycan, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, or protein-based cell walls. bacteria can be divided into two major groups: gram positive and gram negative, based on the gram stain reaction. gram-positive organisms have a thick cell wall, together with teichoic acids. gram-negative organisms have a thin cell wall and an outer envelope containing lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins.","[('gram negative', 'gram negatives'), ('prokaryotic cell', 'prokaryotic cells'), ('conjugation', 'conjugations'), ('transduction', 'transductions'), ('gram positive', 'gram positives'), ('bacterium', 'bacterias', 'bacteria'), ('archaea', 'archaeas'), ('capsule', 'capsules'), ('prokaryote reproduction', 'prokaryote reproductions'), ('prokaryote', 'prokaryotes'), ('plasma membrane', 'plasma membranes'), ('prokaryote evolution', 'prokaryote evolutions'), ('s-layer', 's-layers'), ('teichoic acid', 'teichoic acids'), ('cell wall', 'cell walls'), ('peptidoglycan', 'peptidoglycans')]"
111,stax-bio,22,Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea,3,m44606,Prokaryotic Metabolism,"prokaryotes are metabolically diverse organisms. there are many different environments on earth with various energy and carbon sources, and variable conditions. prokaryotes have been able to live in every environment by using whatever energy and carbon sources are available. prokaryotes fill many niches on earth, including being involved in nutrient cycles such as nitrogen and carbon cycles, decomposing dead organisms, and thriving inside living organisms, including humans. the very broad range of environments that prokaryotes occupy is possible because they have diverse metabolic processes. the diverse environments and ecosystems on earth have a wide range of conditions in terms of temperature, available nutrients, acidity, salinity, and energy sources. prokaryotes are very well equipped to make their living out of a vast array of nutrients and conditions. to live, prokaryotes need a source of energy, a source of carbon, and some additional nutrients. cells are essentially a well-organized assemblage of macromolecules and water. recall that macromolecules are produced by the polymerization of smaller units called monomers. for cells to build all of the molecules required to sustain life, they need certain substances, collectively called nutrients. when prokaryotes grow in nature, they obtain their nutrients from the environment. nutrients that are required in large amounts are called macronutrients, whereas those required in smaller or trace amounts are called micronutrients. just a handful of elements are considered macronutrientscarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. (a mnemonic for remembering these elements is the acronym chonps.) why are these macronutrients needed in large amounts? they are the components of organic compounds in cells, including water. carbon is the major element in all macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and many other compounds. carbon accounts for about 50 percent of the composition of the cell. nitrogen represents 12 percent of the total dry weight of a typical cell and is a component of proteins, nucleic acids, and other cell constituents. most of the nitrogen available in nature is either atmospheric nitrogen (n2) or another inorganic form. diatomic (n2) nitrogen, however, can be converted into an organic form only by certain organisms, called nitrogen-fixing organisms. both hydrogen and oxygen are part of many organic compounds and of water. phosphorus is required by all organisms for the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. sulfur is part of the structure of some amino acids such as cysteine and methionine, and is also present in several vitamins and coenzymes. other important macronutrients are potassium (k), magnesium (mg), calcium (ca), and sodium (na). although these elements are required in smaller amounts, they are very important for the structure and function of the prokaryotic cell. in addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require various metallic elements in small amounts. these are referred to as micronutrients or trace elements. for example, iron is necessary for the function of the cytochromes involved in electron-transport reactions. some prokaryotes require other elementssuch as boron (b), chromium (cr), and manganese (mn)primarily as enzyme cofactors. prokaryotes can use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules. phototrophs (or phototrophic organisms) obtain their energy from sunlight. chemotrophs (or chemosynthetic organisms) obtain their energy from chemical compounds. chemotrophs that can use organic compounds as energy sources are called chemoorganotrophs. those that can also use inorganic compounds as energy sources are called chemolitotrophs. prokaryotes not only can use different sources of energy but also different sources of carbon compounds. recall that organisms that are able to fix inorganic carbon are called autotrophs. autotrophic prokaryotes synthesize organic molecules from carbon dioxide. in contrast, heterotrophic prokaryotes obtain carbon from organic compounds. to make the picture more complex, the terms that describe how prokaryotes obtain energy and carbon can be combined. thus, photoautotrophs use energy from sunlight, and carbon from carbon dioxide and water, whereas chemoheterotrophs obtain energy and carbon from an organic chemical source. chemolitoautotrophs obtain their energy from inorganic compounds, and they build their complex molecules from carbon dioxide. the table below ([link]) summarizes carbon and energy sources in prokaryotes. prokaryotes are ubiquitous: there is no niche or ecosystem in which they are not present. prokaryotes play many roles in the environments they occupy. the roles they play in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are vital to life on earth. carbon is one of the most important macronutrients, and prokaryotes play an important role in the carbon cycle ([link]). carbon is cycled through earths major reservoirs: land, the atmosphere, aquatic environments, sediments and rocks, and biomass. the movement of carbon is via carbon dioxide, which is removed from the atmosphere by land plants and marine prokaryotes, and is returned to the atmosphere via the respiration of chemoorganotrophic organisms, including prokaryotes, fungi, and animals. although the largest carbon reservoir in terrestrial ecosystems is in rocks and sediments, that carbon is not readily available. a large amount of available carbon is found in land plants. plants, which are producers, use carbon dioxide from the air to synthesize carbon compounds. related to this, one very significant source of carbon compounds is humus, which is a mixture of organic materials from dead plants and prokaryotes that have resisted decomposition. consumers such as animals use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. then, bacteria and fungi, collectively called decomposers, carry out the breakdown (decomposition) of plants and animals and their organic compounds. the most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decomposition of dead material (dead animals, plants, and humus) that undergo respiration. in aqueous environments and their anoxic sediments, there is another carbon cycle taking place. in this case, the cycle is based on one-carbon compounds. in anoxic sediments, prokaryotes, mostly archaea, produce methane (ch4). this methane moves into the zone above the sediment, which is richer in oxygen and supports bacteria called methane oxidizers that oxidize methane to carbon dioxide, which then returns to the atmosphere. nitrogen is a very important element for life because it is part of proteins and nucleic acids. it is a macronutrient, and in nature, it is recycled from organic compounds to ammonia, ammonium ions, nitrate, nitrite, and nitrogen gas by myriad processes, many of which are carried out only by prokaryotes. as illustrated in [link], prokaryotes are key to the nitrogen cycle. the largest pool of nitrogen available in the terrestrial ecosystem is gaseous nitrogen from the air, but this nitrogen is not usable by plants, which are primary producers. gaseous nitrogen is transformed, or fixed into more readily available forms such as ammonia through the process of nitrogen fixation. ammonia can be used by plants or converted to other forms. another source of ammonia is ammonification, the process by which ammonia is released during the decomposition of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. ammonia released to the atmosphere, however, represents only 15 percent of the total nitrogen released; the rest is as n2 and n2o. ammonia is catabolized anaerobically by some prokaryotes, yielding n2 as the final product. nitrification is the conversion of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria belonging to the genera nitrosomas, nitrobacter, and nitrospira. the bacteria performs the reverse process, the reduction of nitrate from the soils to gaseous compounds such as n2o, no, and n2, a process called denitrification. prokaryotes are the most metabolically diverse organisms; they flourish in many different environments with various carbon energy and carbon sources, variable temperature, ph, pressure, and water availability. nutrients required in large amounts are called macronutrients, whereas those required in trace amounts are called micronutrients or trace elements. macronutrients include c, h, o, n, p, s, k, mg, ca, and na. in addition to these macronutrients, prokaryotes require various metallic elements for growth and enzyme function. prokaryotes use different sources of energy to assemble macromolecules from smaller molecules. phototrophs obtain their energy from sunlight, whereas chemotrophs obtain energy from chemical compounds. prokaryotes play roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycles. carbon is returned to the atmosphere by the respiration of animals and other chemoorganotrophic organisms. consumers use organic compounds generated by producers and release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. the most important contributor of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere is microbial decomposition of dead material. nitrogen is recycled in nature from organic compounds to ammonia, ammonium ions, nitrite, nitrate, and nitrogen gas. gaseous nitrogen is transformed into ammonia through nitrogen fixation. ammonia is anaerobically catabolized by some prokaryotes, yielding n2 as the final product. nitrification is the conversion of ammonium into nitrite. nitrification in soils is carried out by bacteria. denitrification is also performed by bacteria and transforms nitrate from soils into gaseous nitrogen compounds, such as n2o, no, and n2.","[('nitrogen cycle', 'nitrogen cycles'), ('nitrification', 'nitrifications'), ('decomposer', 'decomposers'), ('micronutrient', 'micronutrients'),

112,stax-bio,22,Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea,4,m44607,Bacterial Diseases in Humans,"devastating pathogen-borne diseases and plagues, both viral and bacterial in nature, have affected humans since the beginning of human history. the true cause of these diseases was not understood at the time, and some people thought that diseases were a spiritual punishment. over time, people came to realize that staying apart from afflicted persons, and disposing of the corpses and personal belongings of victims of illness, reduced their own chances of getting sick. epidemiologists study how diseases affect a population. an epidemic is a disease that occurs in an unusually high number of individuals in a population at the same time. a pandemic is a widespread, usually worldwide, epidemic. an endemic disease is a disease that is constantly present, usually at low incidence, in a population. there are records about infectious diseases as far back as 3000 b.c. a number of significant pandemics caused by bacteria have been documented over several hundred years. some of the most memorable pandemics led to the decline of cities and nations. in the 21st century, infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide, despite advances made in medical research and treatments in recent decades. a disease spreads when the pathogen that causes it is passed from one person to another. for a pathogen to cause disease, it must be able to reproduce in the hosts body and damage the host in some way. in 430 b.c., the plague of athens killed one-quarter of the athenian troops that were fighting in the great peloponnesian war and weakened athens dominance and power. the plague impacted people living in overcrowded athens as well as troops aboard ships that had to return to athens. the source of the plague may have been identified recently when researchers from the university of athens were able to use dna from teeth recovered from a mass grave. the scientists identified nucleotide sequences from a pathogenic bacterium, salmonella enterica serovar typhi ([link]), which causes typhoid fever.1 this disease is commonly seen in overcrowded areas and has caused epidemics throughout recorded history. from 541 to 750, an outbreak of what was likely a bubonic plague (the plague of justinian), eliminated one-quarter to one-half of the human population in the eastern mediterranean region. the population in europe dropped by 50 percent during this outbreak. bubonic plague would strike europe more than once. one of the most devastating pandemics was the black death (1346 to 1361) that is believed to have been another outbreak of bubonic plague caused by the bacterium yersinia pestis. it is thought to have originated initially in china and spread along the silk road, a network of land and sea trade routes, to the mediterranean region and europe, carried by rat fleas living on black rats that were always present on ships. the black death reduced the worlds population from an estimated 450 million to about 350 to 375 million. bubonic plague struck london hard again in the mid-1600s ([link]). in modern times, approximately 1,000 to 3,000 cases of plague arise globally each year. although contracting bubonic plague before antibiotics meant almost certain death, the bacterium responds to several types of modern antibiotics, and mortality rates from plague are now very low. over the centuries, europeans tended to develop genetic immunity to endemic infectious diseases, but when european conquerors reached the western hemisphere, they brought with them disease-causing bacteria and viruses, which triggered epidemics that completely devastated populations of native americans, who had no natural resistance to many european diseases. it has been estimated that up to 90 percent of native americans died from infectious diseases after the arrival of europeans, making conquest of the new world a foregone conclusion. the distribution of a particular disease is dynamic. therefore, changes in the environment, the pathogen, or the host population can dramatically impact the spread of a disease. according to the world health organization (who) an emerging disease ([link]) is one that has appeared in a population for the first time, or that may have existed previously but is rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. this definition also includes re-emerging diseases that were previously under control. approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are zoonotic diseases, zoonoses, diseases that primarily infect animals and are transmitted to humans; some are of viral origin and some are of bacterial origin. brucellosis is an example of a prokaryotic zoonosis that is re-emerging in some regions, and necrotizing fasciitis (commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria) has been increasing in virulence for the last 80 years for unknown reasons. some of the present emerging diseases are not actually new, but are diseases that were catastrophic in the past ([link]). they devastated populations and became dormant for a while, just to come back, sometimes more virulent than before, as was the case with bubonic plague. other diseases, like tuberculosis, were never eradicated but were under control in some regions of the world until coming back, mostly in urban centers with high concentrations of immunocompromised people. the who has identified certain diseases whose worldwide re-emergence should be monitored. among these are two viral diseases (dengue fever and yellow fever), and three bacterial diseases (diphtheria, cholera, and bubonic plague). the war against infectious diseases has no foreseeable end. recall that biofilms are microbial communities that are very difficult to destroy. they are responsible for diseases such as infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, legionnaires disease, and otitis media. they produce dental plaque and colonize catheters, prostheses, transcutaneous and orthopedic devices, contact lenses, and internal devices such as pacemakers. they also form in open wounds and burned tissue. in healthcare environments, biofilms grow on hemodialysis machines, mechanical ventilators, shunts, and other medical equipment. in fact, 65 percent of all infections acquired in the hospital (nosocomial infections) are attributed to biofilms. biofilms are also related to diseases contracted from food because they colonize the surfaces of vegetable leaves and meat, as well as food-processing equipment that isnt adequately cleaned. biofilm infections develop gradually; sometimes, they do not cause symptoms immediately. they are rarely resolved by host defense mechanisms. once an infection by a biofilm is established, it is very difficult to eradicate, because biofilms tend to be resistant to most of the methods used to control microbial growth, including antibiotics. biofilms respond poorly or only temporarily to antibiotics; it has been said that they can resist up to 1,000 times the antibiotic concentrations used to kill the same bacteria when they are free-living or planktonic. an antibiotic dose that large would harm the patient; therefore, scientists are working on new ways to get rid of biofilms. the word antibiotic comes from the greek anti meaning against and bios meaning life. an antibiotic is a chemical, produced either by microbes or synthetically, that is hostile to the growth of other organisms. todays news and media often address concerns about an antibiotic crisis. are the antibiotics that easily treated bacterial infections in the past becoming obsolete? are there new superbugsbacteria that have evolved to become more resistant to our arsenal of antibiotics? is this the beginning of the end of antibiotics? all these questions challenge the healthcare community. one of the main causes of resistant bacteria is the abuse of antibiotics. the imprudent and excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in the natural selection of resistant forms of bacteria. the antibiotic kills most of the infecting bacteria, and therefore only the resistant forms remain. these resistant forms reproduce, resulting in an increase in the proportion of resistant forms over non-resistant ones. another major misuse of antibiotics is in patients with colds or the flu, for which antibiotics are useless. another problem is the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock. the routine use of antibiotics in animal feed promotes bacterial resistance as well. in the united states, 70 percent of the antibiotics produced are fed to animals. these antibiotics are given to livestock in low doses, which maximize the probability of resistance developing, and these resistant bacteria are readily transferred to humans. the imprudent use of antibiotics has paved the way for bacteria to expand populations of resistant forms. for example, staphylococcus aureus, often called staph, is a common bacterium that can live in the human body and is usually easily treated with antibiotics. a very dangerous strain, however, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has made the news over the past few years ([link]). this strain is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics, including methicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, and oxacillin. mrsa can cause infections of the skin, but it can also infect the bloodstream, lungs, urinary tract, or sites of injury. while mrsa infections are common among people in healthcare facilities, they have also appeared in healthy people who havent been hospitalized but who live or work in tight populations (like military personnel and prisoners). researchers have expressed concern about the way this latter source of mrsa targets a much younger population than those residing in care facilities. the journal of the american medical association reported that, among mrsa-afflicted persons in healthcare facilities, the average age is 68, whereas people with community-associated mrsa (ca-mrsa) have an average age of 23.2 in summary, the medical community is facing an antibiotic crisis. some scientists believe that after years of being protected from bacterial infections by antibiotics, we may be returning to a time in which a simple bacterial infection could again devastate the human population. researchers are developing new antibiotics, but it takes many years to of research and clinical trials, plus financial investments in the millions of dollars, to generate an effective and approved drug. prokaryotes are everywhere: they readily colonize the surface of any type of material, and food is not an exception. most of the time, prokaryotes colonize food and food-processing equipment in the form of a biofilm. outbreaks of bacterial infection related to food consumption are common. a foodborne disease (colloquially called food poisoning) is an illness resulting from the consumption the pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or other parasites that contaminate food. although the united states has one of the safest food supplies in the world, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has reported that 76 million people get sick, more than 300,000 are hospitalized, and 5,000 americans die each year from foodborne illness. the characteristics of foodborne illnesses have changed over time. in the past, it was relatively common to hear about sporadic cases of botulism, the potentially fatal disease produced by a toxin from the anaerobic bacterium clostridium botulinum. some of the most common sources for this bacterium were non-acidic canned foods, homemade pickles, and processed meat and sausages. the can, jar, or package created a suitable anaerobic environment where clostridium could grow. proper sterilization and canning procedures have reduced the incidence of this disease. while people may tend to think of foodborne illnesses as associated with animal-based foods, most cases are now linked to produce. there have been serious, produce-related outbreaks associated with raw spinach in the united states and with vegetable sprouts in germany, and these types of outbreaks have become more common. the raw spinach outbreak in 2006 was produced by the bacterium e. coli serotype o157:h7. a serotype is a strain of bacteria that carries a set of similar antigens on its cell surface, and there are often many different serotypes of a bacterial species. most e. coli are not particularly dangerous to humans, but serotype o157:h7 can cause bloody diarrhea and is potentially fatal. all types of food can potentially be contaminated with bacteria. recent outbreaks of salmonella reported by the cdc occurred in foods as diverse as peanut butter, alfalfa sprouts, and eggs. a deadly outbreak in germany in 2010 was caused by e. coli contamination of vegetable sprouts ([link]). the strain that caused the outbreak was found to be a new serotype not previously involved in other outbreaks, which indicates that e. coli is continuously evolving. epidemiologistepidemiology is the study of the occurrence, distribution, and determinants of health and disease in a population. it is, therefore, part of public health. an epidemiologist studies the frequency and distribution of diseases within human populations and environments. epidemiologists collect data about a particular disease and track its spread to identify the original mode of transmission. they sometimes work in close collaboration with historians to try to understand the way a disease evolved geographically and over time, tracking the natural history of pathogens. they gather information from clinical records, patient interviews, surveillance, and any other available means. that information is used to develop strategies, such as vaccinations ([link]), and design public health policies to reduce the incidence of a disease or to prevent its spread. epidemiologists also conduct rapid investigations in case of an outbreak to recommend immediate measures to control it. an epidemiologist has a bachelors degree, plus a masters degree in public health (mph). many epidemiologists are also physicians (and have an m.d.), or they have a ph.d. in an associated field, such as biology or microbiology. devastating diseases and plagues have been among us since early times. there are records about microbial diseases as far back as 3000 b.c. infectious diseases remain among the leading causes of death worldwide. emerging diseases are those rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. they can be new or re-emerging diseases (previously under control). many emerging diseases affecting humans, such as brucellosis, are zoonoses. the who has identified a group of diseases whose re-emergence should be monitored: those caused by bacteria include bubonic plague, diphtheria, and cholera. biofilms are considered responsible for diseases such as bacterial infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, legionnaires disease, and otitis media. they produce dental plaque; colonize catheters, prostheses, transcutaneous, and orthopedic devices; and infect contact lenses, open wounds, and burned tissue. biofilms also produce foodborne diseases because they colonize the surfaces of food and food-processing equipment. biofilms are resistant to most of the methods used to control microbial growth. the excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in a major global problem, since resistant forms of bacteria have been selected over time. a very dangerous strain, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), has wreaked havoc recently. foodborne diseases result from the consumption of contaminated food, pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or parasites that contaminate food.","[('mrsa', 'mrsas'), ('bacterium', 'bacterias', 'bacteria'), ('endemic disease', 'endemic diseases'), ('botulism', 'botulisms'),

113,stax-bio,22,Prokaryotes: Bacteria and Archaea,5,m44609,Beneficial Prokaryotes,"not all prokaryotes are pathogenic. on the contrary, pathogens represent only a very small percentage of the diversity of the microbial world. in fact, our life would not be possible without prokaryotes. just think about the role of prokaryotes in biogeochemical cycles. nitrogen is a very important element to living things, because it is part of nucleotides and amino acids that are the building blocks of nucleic acids and proteins, respectively. nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial ecosystems, with atmospheric nitrogen, n2, providing the largest pool of available nitrogen. however, eukaryotes cannot use atmospheric, gaseous nitrogen to synthesize macromolecules. fortunately, nitrogen can be fixed, meaning it is converted into ammonia (nh3) either biologically or abiotically. abiotic nitrogen fixation occurs as a result of lightning or by industrial processes. biological nitrogen fixation (bnf) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes: soil bacteria, cyanobacteria, and frankia spp. (filamentous bacteria interacting with actinorhizal plants such as alder, bayberry, and sweet fern). after photosynthesis, bnf is the second most important biological process on earth. the equation representing the process is as follows where pi stands for inorganic phosphate. the total fixed nitrogen through bnf is about 100 to 180 million metric tons per year. biological processes contribute 65 percent of the nitrogen used in agriculture. cyanobacteria are the most important nitrogen fixers in aquatic environments. in soil, members of the genus clostridium are examples of free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria. other bacteria live symbiotically with legume plants, providing the most important source of bnf. symbionts may fix more nitrogen in soils than free-living organisms by a factor of 10. soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, are able to symbiotically interact with legumes to form nodules, specialized structures where nitrogen fixation occurs ([link]). nitrogenase, the enzyme that fixes nitrogen, is inactivated by oxygen, so the nodule provides an oxygen-free area for nitrogen fixation to take place. this process provides a natural and inexpensive plant fertilizer, as it reduces atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, which is easily usable by plants. the use oflegumes is an excellent alternative tochemical fertilization and is of specialinterest to sustainable agriculture, which seeks to minimize theuse of chemicals and conserve natural resources. through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using an endless source of nitrogen: the atmosphere. bacteria benefit from using photosynthates (carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis) from the plant and having a protected niche. additionally, the soil benefits from being naturally fertilized. therefore, the use of rhizobia as biofertilizers is a sustainable practice. why are legumes so important? some, like soybeans,are key sources of agricultural protein.some of the most important grain legumes are soybean, peanuts, peas, chickpeas, and beans. other legumes, such as alfalfa, are used to feed cattle. according to the united nations convention on biological diversity, biotechnology is any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use.""1 the concept of specific use involves some sort of commercial application. genetic engineering, artificial selection, antibiotic production, and cell culture are current topics of study in biotechnology. however, humans have used prokaryotes before the term biotechnology was even coined. in addition, some of the goods and services are as simple as cheese, bread, wine, beer, and yogurt, which employ both bacteria and other microbes, such as yeast, a fungus ([link]). cheese production began around 4,0007,000 years ago when humans began to breed animals and process their milk. fermentation in this case preserves nutrients: milk will spoil relatively quickly, but when processed as cheese, it is more stable. as for beer, the oldest records of brewing are about 6,000 years old and refer to the sumerians. evidence indicates that the sumerians discovered fermentation by chance.wine has been produced for about 4,500 years, and evidence suggests that cultured milk products, like yogurt, have existed for at least 4,000 years. microbial bioremediation is the use of prokaryotes (or microbial metabolism) to remove pollutants. bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals (pesticides, fertilizers) that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface. certain toxic metals and oxides, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed from water by bioremediation. the reduction of seo4-2 to seo3-2 and to se0 (metallic selenium) is a method used to remove selenium ions from water. mercury is an example of a toxic metal that can be removed from an environment by bioremediation. as an active ingredient of some pesticides, mercury is used in industry and is also a by-product of certain processes, such as battery production. methyl mercury is usually present in very low concentrations in natural environments, but it is highly toxic because it accumulates in living tissues. several species of bacteria can carry out the biotransformation of toxic mercury into nontoxic forms. these bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, can convert hg+2 into hg0, which is nontoxic to humans. one of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil spills. the importance of prokaryotes to petroleum bioremediation has been demonstrated in several oil spills in recent years, such as the exxon valdez spill in alaska (1989) ([link]), the prestige oil spill in spain (2002), the spill into the mediterranean from a lebanon power plant (2006), and more recently, the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico (2010). to clean up these spills, bioremediation is promoted by the addition of inorganic nutrients that help bacteria to grow. hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria feed on hydrocarbons in the oil droplet, breaking down the hydrocarbons. some species, such as alcanivorax borkumensis, produce surfactants that solubilize the oil, whereas other bacteria degrade the oil into carbon dioxide. in the case of oil spills in the ocean, ongoing, natural bioremediation tends to occur, inasmuch as there are oil-consuming bacteria in the ocean prior to the spill. in addition to naturally occurring oil-degrading bacteria, humans select and engineer bacteria that possess the same capability with increased efficacy and spectrum of hydrocarbon compounds that can be processed. under ideal conditions, it has been reported that up to 80 percent of the nonvolatile components in oil can be degraded within one year of the spill. other oil fractions containing aromatic and highly branched hydrocarbon chains are more difficult to remove and remain in the environment for longer periods of time. microbes on the human bodythe commensal bacteria that inhabit our skin and gastrointestinal tract do a host of good things for us. they protect us from pathogens, help us digest our food, and produce some of our vitamins and other nutrients. these activities have been known for a long time. more recently, scientists have gathered evidence that these bacteria may also help regulate our moods, influence our activity levels, and even help control weight by affecting our food choices and absorption patterns. the human microbiome project has begun the process of cataloging our normal bacteria (and archaea) so we can better understand these functions. a particularly fascinating example of our normal flora relates to our digestive systems. people who take high doses of antibiotics tend to lose many of their normal gut bacteria, allowing a naturally antibiotic-resistant species called clostridium difficile to overgrow and cause severe gastric problems, especially chronic diarrhea ([link]). obviously, trying to treat this problem with antibiotics only makes it worse. however, it has been successfully treated by giving the patients fecal transplants from healthy donors to reestablish the normal intestinal microbial community. clinical trials are underway to ensure the safety and effectiveness of this technique. scientists are also discovering that the absence of certain key microbes from our intestinal tract may set us up for a variety of problems. this seems to be particularly true regarding the appropriate functioning of the immune system. there are intriguing findings that suggest that the absence of these microbes is an important contributor to the development of allergies and some autoimmune disorders. research is currently underway to test whether adding certain microbes to our internal ecosystem may help in the treatment of these problems as well as in treating some forms of autism. pathogens are only a small percentage of all prokaryotes. in fact, our life would not be possible without prokaryotes. nitrogen is usually the most limiting element in terrestrial ecosystems; atmospheric nitrogen, the largest pool of available nitrogen, is unavailable to eukaryotes. nitrogen can be fixed, or converted into ammonia (nh3) either biologically or abiotically. biological nitrogen fixation (bnf) is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes. after photosynthesis, bnf is the second most important biological process on earth. the most important source of bnf is the symbiotic interaction between soil bacteria and legume plants. microbial bioremediation is the use of microbial metabolism to remove pollutants. bioremediation has been used to remove agricultural chemicals that leach from soil into groundwater and the subsurface. toxic metals and oxides, such as selenium and arsenic compounds, can also be removed by bioremediation. probably one of the most useful and interesting examples of the use of prokaryotes for bioremediation purposes is the cleanup of oil spills. human life is only possible due to the action of microbes, both those in the environment and those species that call us home. internally, they help us digest our food, produce crucial nutrients for us, protect us from pathogenic microbes, and help train our immune systems to function correctly.","[('biological nitrogen

114,stax-bio,23,Protists,0,m44612,Introduction,"humans have been familiar with macroscopic organisms (organisms big enough to see with the unaided eye) since before there was a written history, and it is likely that most cultures distinguished between animals and land plants, and most probably included the macroscopic fungi as plants. therefore, it became an interesting challenge to deal with the world of microorganisms once microscopes were developed a few centuries ago. many different naming schemes were used over the last couple of centuries, but it has become the most common practice to refer to eukaryotes that are not land plants, animals, or fungi as protists. this name was first suggested by ernst haeckel in the late nineteenth century. it has been applied in many contexts and has been formally used to represent a kingdom-level taxon called protista. however, many modern systematists (biologists who study the relationships among organisms) are beginning to shy away from the idea of formal ranks such as kingdom and phylum. instead, they are naming taxa as groups of organisms thought to include all the descendants of a last common ancestor (monophyletic group). during the past two decades, the field of molecular genetics has demonstrated that some protists are more related to animals, plants, or fungi than they are to other protists. therefore,  not including animals, plants and fungi make the kingdom protista a paraphyletic group, or one that does not include all descendents of its common ancestor. for this reason, protist lineages originally classified into the kingdom protista continue to be examined and debated. in the meantime, the term protist still is used informally to describe this tremendously diverse group of eukaryotes. most protists are microscopic, unicellular organisms that are abundant in soil, freshwater, brackish, and marine environments. they are also common in the digestive tracts of animals and in the vascular tissues of plants. others invade the cells of other protists, animals, and plants. not all protists are microscopic. some have huge, macroscopic cells, such as the plasmodia (giant amoebae) of myxomycete slime molds or the marine green alga caulerpa, which can have single cells that can be several meters in size. some protists are multicellular, such as the red, green, and brown seaweeds. it is among the protists that one finds the wealth of ways that organisms can grow.","[('archaeplastida', 'archaeplastidas'), ('radiolarian', 'radiolarians'), ('apicomplexan', 'apicomplexans'), ('red alga', 'red

115,stax-bio,23,Protists,1,m44614,Eukaryotic Origins,"living things fall into three large groups: archaea, bacteria, and eukarya. the first two have prokaryotic cells, and the third contains all eukaryotes. a relatively sparse fossil record is available to help discern what the first members of each of these lineages looked like, so it is possible that all the events that led to the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes will remain unknown. however, comparative biology of extant organisms and the limited fossil record provide some insight into the history of eukarya. the earliest fossils found appear to be bacteria, most likely cyanobacteria. they are about 3.5 billion years old and are recognizable because of their relatively complex structure and, for prokaryotes, relatively large cells. most other prokaryotes have small cells, 1 or 2 m in size, and would be difficult to pick out as fossils. most living eukaryotes have cells measuring 10 m or greater. structures this size, which might be fossils, appear in the geological record about 2.1 billion years ago. data from these fossils have led comparative biologists to the conclusion that living eukaryotes are all descendants of a single common ancestor. mapping the characteristics found in all major groups of eukaryotes reveals that the following characteristics must have been present in the last common ancestor, because these characteristics are present in at least some of the members of each major lineage. cells with nuclei surrounded by a nuclear envelope with nuclear pores. this is the single characteristic that is both necessary and sufficient to define an organism as a eukaryote. all extant eukaryotes have cells with nuclei. mitochondria. some extant eukaryotes have very reduced remnants of mitochondria in their cells, whereas other members of their lineages have typical mitochondria. a cytoskeleton containing the structural and motility components called actin microfilaments and microtubules. all extant eukaryotes have these cytoskeletal elements. flagella and cilia, organelles associated with cell motility. some extant eukaryotes lack flagella and/or cilia, but they are descended from ancestors that possessed them. chromosomes, each consisting of a linear dna molecule coiled around basic (alkaline) proteins called histones. the few eukaryotes with chromosomes lacking histones clearly evolved from ancestors that had them. mitosis, a process of nuclear division wherein replicated chromosomes are divided and separated using elements of the cytoskeleton. mitosis is universally present in eukaryotes. sex, a process of genetic recombination unique to eukaryotes in which diploid nuclei at one stage of the life cycle undergo meiosis to yield haploid nuclei and subsequent karyogamy, a stage where two haploid nuclei fuse together to create a diploid zygote nucleus. members of all major lineages have cell walls, and it might be reasonable to conclude that the last common ancestor could make cell walls during some stage of its life cycle. however, not enough is known about eukaryotes cell walls and their development to know how much homology exists among them. if the last common ancestor could make cell walls, it is clear that this ability must have been lost in many groups.  in order to understand eukaryotic organisms fully, it is necessary to understand that all extant eukaryotes are descendants of a chimeric organism that was a composite of a host cell and the cell(s) of an alpha-proteobacterium that took up residence inside it. this major theme in the origin of eukaryotes is known as endosymbiosis, one cell engulfing another such that the engulfed cell survives and both cells benefit. over many generations, a symbiotic relationship can result in two organisms that depend on each other so completely that neither could survive on its own. endosymbiotic events likely contributed to the origin of the last common ancestor of todays eukaryotes and to later diversification in certain lineages of eukaryotes ([link]). before explaining this further, it is necessary to consider metabolism in prokaryotes. many important metabolic processes arose in prokaryotes, and some of these, such as nitrogen fixation, are never found in eukaryotes. the process of aerobic respiration is found in all major lineages of eukaryotes, and it is localized in the mitochondria. aerobic respiration is also found in many lineages of prokaryotes, but it is not present in all of them, and many forms of evidence suggest that such anaerobic prokaryotes never carried out aerobic respiration nor did their ancestors. while todays atmosphere is about one-fifth molecular oxygen (o2), geological evidence shows that it originally lacked o2. without oxygen, aerobic respiration would not be expected, and living things would have relied on fermentation instead. at some point before, about 3.5 billion years ago, some prokaryotes began using energy from sunlight to power anabolic processes that reduce carbon dioxide to form organic compounds. that is, they evolved the ability to photosynthesize. hydrogen, derived from various sources, was captured using light-powered reactions to reduce fixed carbon dioxide in the calvin cycle. the group of gram-negative bacteria that gave rise to cyanobacteria used water as the hydrogen source and released o2 as a waste product. eventually, the amount of photosynthetic oxygen built up in some environments to levels that posed a risk to living organisms, since it can damage many organic compounds. various metabolic processes evolved that protected organisms from oxygen, one of which, aerobic respiration, also generated high levels of atp. it became widely present among prokaryotes, including in a group we now call alpha-proteobacteria. organisms that did not acquire aerobic respiration had to remain in oxygen-free environments. originally, oxygen-rich environments were likely localized around places where cyanobacteria were active, but by about 2 billion years ago, geological evidence shows that oxygen was building up to higher concentrations in the atmosphere. oxygen levels similar to todays levels only arose within the last 700 million years. recall that the first fossils that we believe to be eukaryotes date to about 2 billion years old, so they appeared as oxygen levels were increasing. also, recall that all extant eukaryotes descended from an ancestor with mitochondria. these organelles were first observed by light microscopists in the late 1800s, where they appeared to be somewhat worm-shaped structures that seemed to be moving around in the cell. some early observers suggested that they might be bacteria living inside host cells, but these hypotheses remained unknown or rejected in most scientific communities. as cell biology developed in the twentieth century, it became clear that mitochondria were the organelles responsible for producing atp using aerobic respiration. in the 1960s, american biologist lynn margulis developed endosymbiotic theory, which states that eukaryotes may have been a product of one cell engulfing another, one living within another, and evolving over time until the separate cells were no longer recognizable as such. in 1967, margulis introduced new work on the theory and substantiated her findings through microbiological evidence. although margulis work initially was met with resistance, this once-revolutionary hypothesis is now widely (but not completely) accepted, with work progressing on uncovering the steps involved in this evolutionary process and the key players involved. much still remains to be discovered about the origins of the cells that now make up the cells in all living eukaryotes. broadly, it has become clear that many of our nuclear genes and the molecular machinery responsible for replication and expression appear closely related to those in archaea. on the other hand, the metabolic organelles and genes responsible for many energy-harvesting processes had their origins in bacteria. much remains to be clarified about how this relationship occurred; this continues to be an exciting field of discovery in biology. for instance, it is not known whether the endosymbiotic event that led to mitochondria occurred before or after the host cell had a nucleus. such organisms would be among the extinct precursors of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes. one of the major features distinguishing prokaryotes from eukaryotes is the presence of mitochondria. eukaryotic cells may contain anywhere from one to several thousand mitochondria, depending on the cells level of energy consumption. each mitochondrion measures 1 to 10 or greater micrometers in length and exists in the cell as an organelle that can be ovoid to worm-shaped to intricately branched ([link]). mitochondria arise from the division of existing mitochondria; they may fuse together; and they may be moved around inside the cell by interactions with the cytoskeleton. however, mitochondria cannot survive outside the cell. as the atmosphere was oxygenated by photosynthesis, and as successful aerobic prokaryotes evolved, evidence suggests that an ancestral cell with some membrane compartmentalization engulfed a free-living aerobic prokaryote, specifically an alpha-proteobacterium, thereby giving the host cell the ability to use oxygen to release energy stored in nutrients. alpha-proteobacteria are a large group of bacteria that includes species symbiotic with plants, disease organisms that can infect humans via ticks, and many free-living species that use light for energy. several lines of evidence support that mitochondria are derived from this endosymbiotic event. most mitochondria are shaped like alpha-proteobacteria and are surrounded by two membranes, which would result when one membrane-bound organism was engulfed into a vacuole by another membrane-bound organism. the mitochondrial inner membrane is extensive and involves substantial infoldings called cristae that resemble the textured, outer surface of alpha-proteobacteria. the matrix and inner membrane are rich with the enzymes necessary for aerobic respiration. mitochondria divide independently by a process that resembles binary fission in prokaryotes. specifically, mitochondria are not formed from scratch (de novo) by the eukaryotic cell; they reproduce within it and are distributed with the cytoplasm when a cell divides or two cells fuse. therefore, although these organelles are highly integrated into the eukaryotic cell, they still reproduce as if they are independent organisms within the cell. however, their reproduction is synchronized with the activity and division of the cell. mitochondria have their own (usually) circular dna chromosome that is stabilized by attachments to the inner membrane and carries genes similar to genes expressed by alpha-proteobacteria. mitochondria also have special ribosomes and transfer rnas that resemble these components in prokaryotes. these features all support that mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes. mitochondria that carry out aerobic respiration have their own genomes, with genes similar to those in alpha-proteobacteria. however, many of the genes for respiratory proteins are located in the nucleus. when these genes are compared to those of other organisms, they appear to be of alpha-proteobacterial origin. additionally, in some eukaryotic groups, such genes are found in the mitochondria, whereas in other groups, they are found in the nucleus. this has been interpreted as evidence that genes have been transferred from the endosymbiont chromosome to the host genome. this loss of genes by the endosymbiont is probably one explanation why mitochondria cannot live without a host. some living eukaryotes are anaerobic and cannot survive in the presence of too much oxygen. some appear to lack organelles that could be recognized as mitochondria. in the 1970s to the early 1990s, many biologists suggested that some of these eukaryotes were descended from ancestors whose lineages had diverged from the lineage of mitochondrion-containing eukaryotes before endosymbiosis occurred. however, later findings suggest that reduced organelles are found in most, if not all, anaerobic eukaryotes, and that all eukaryotes appear to carry some genes in their nuclei that are of mitochondrial origin. in addition to the aerobic generation of atp, mitochondria have several other metabolic functions. one of these functions is to generate clusters of iron and sulfur that are important cofactors of many enzymes. such functions are often associated with the reduced mitochondrion-derived organelles of anaerobic eukaryotes. therefore, most biologists accept that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes had mitochondria. some groups of eukaryotes are photosynthetic. their cells contain, in addition to the standard eukaryotic organelles, another kind of organelle called a plastid. when such cells are carrying out photosynthesis, their plastids are rich in the pigment chlorophyll a and a range of other pigments, called accessory pigments, which are involved in harvesting energy from light. photosynthetic plastids are called chloroplasts ([link]). like mitochondria, plastids appear to have an endosymbiotic origin. this hypothesis was also championed by lynn margulis. plastids are derived from cyanobacteria that lived inside the cells of an ancestral, aerobic, heterotrophic eukaryote. this is called primary endosymbiosis, and plastids of primary origin are surrounded by two membranes. the best evidence is that this has happened twice in the history of eukaryotes. in one case, the common ancestor of the major lineage/supergroup archaeplastida took on a cyanobacterial endosymbiont; in the other, the ancestor of the small amoeboid rhizarian taxon, paulinella, took on a different cyanobacterial endosymbiont. almost all photosynthetic eukaryotes are descended from the first event, and only a couple of species are derived from the other. cyanobacteria are a group of gram-negative bacteria with all the conventional structures of the group. however, unlike most prokaryotes, they have extensive, internal membrane-bound sacs called thylakoids. chlorophyll is a component of these membranes, as are many of the proteins of the light reactions of photosynthesis. cyanobacteria also have the peptidoglycan wall and lipopolysaccharide layer associated with gram-negative bacteria. chloroplasts of primary origin have thylakoids, a circular dna chromosome, and ribosomes similar to those of cyanobacteria. each chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes. in the group of archaeplastida called the glaucophytes and in paulinella, a thin peptidoglycan layer is present between the outer and inner plastid membranes. all other plastids lack this relictual cyanobacterial wall. the outer membrane surrounding the plastid is thought to be derived from the vacuole in the host, and the inner membrane is thought to be derived from the plasma membrane of the symbiont. there is also, as with the case of mitochondria, strong evidence that many of the genes of the endosymbiont were transferred to the nucleus. plastids, like mitochondria, cannot live independently outside the host. in addition, like mitochondria, plastids are derived from the division of other plastids and never built from scratch. researchers have suggested that the endosymbiotic event that led to archaeplastida occurred 1 to 1.5 billion years ago, at least 5 hundred million years after the fossil record suggests that eukaryotes were present. not all plastids in eukaryotes are derived directly from primary endosymbiosis. some of the major groups of algae became photosynthetic by secondary endosymbiosis, that is, by taking in either green algae or red algae (both from archaeplastida) as endosymbionts ([link]ab). numerous microscopic and genetic studies have supported this conclusion. secondary plastids are surrounded by three or more membranes, and some secondary plastids even have clear remnants of the nucleus of endosymbiotic alga. others have not kept any remnants. there are cases where tertiary or higher-order endosymbiotic events are the best explanations for plastids in some eukaryotes. secondary endosymbiosis in chlorarachniophytesendosymbiosis involves one cell engulfing another to produce, over time, a coevolved relationship in which neither cell could survive alone. the chloroplasts of red and green algae, for instance, are derived from the engulfment of a photosynthetic cyanobacterium by an early prokaryote. this leads to the question of the possibility of a cell containing an endosymbiont to itself become engulfed, resulting in a secondary endosymbiosis. molecular and morphological evidence suggest that the chlorarachniophyte protists are derived from a secondary endosymbiotic event. chlorarachniophytes are rare algae indigenous to tropical seas and sand that can be classified into the rhizarian supergroup. chlorarachniophytes extend thin cytoplasmic strands, interconnecting themselves with other chlorarachniophytes, in a cytoplasmic network. these protists are thought to have originated when a eukaryote engulfed a green alga, the latter of which had already established an endosymbiotic relationship with a photosynthetic cyanobacterium ([link]). several lines of evidence support that chlorarachniophytes evolved from secondary endosymbiosis. the chloroplasts contained within the green algal endosymbionts still are capable of photosynthesis, making chlorarachniophytes photosynthetic. the green algal endosymbiont also exhibits a stunted vestigial nucleus. in fact, it appears that chlorarachniophytes are the products of an evolutionarily recent secondary endosymbiotic event. the plastids of chlorarachniophytes are surrounded by four membranes: the first two correspond to the inner and outer membranes of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium, the third corresponds to the green alga, and the fourth corresponds to the vacuole that surrounded the green alga when it was engulfed by the chlorarachniophyte ancestor. in other lineages that involved secondary endosymbiosis, only three membranes can be identified around plastids. this is currently rectified as a sequential loss of a membrane during the course of evolution. the process of secondary endosymbiosis is not unique to chlorarachniophytes. in fact, secondary endosymbiosis of green algae also led to euglenid protists, whereas secondary endosymbiosis of red algae led to the evolution of dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, and stramenopiles. the oldest fossil evidence of eukaryotes is about 2 billion years old. fossils older than this all appear to be prokaryotes. it is probable that todays eukaryotes are descended from an ancestor that had a prokaryotic organization. the last common ancestor of todays eukarya had several characteristics, including cells with nuclei that divided mitotically and contained linear chromosomes where the dna was associated with histones, a cytoskeleton and endomembrane system, and the ability to make cilia/flagella during at least part of its life cycle. it was aerobic because it had mitochondria that were the result of an aerobic alpha-proteobacterium that lived inside a host cell. whether this host had a nucleus at the time of the initial symbiosis remains unknown. the last common ancestor may have had a cell wall for at least part of its life cycle, but more data are needed to confirm this hypothesis. todays eukaryotes are very diverse in their shapes, organization, life cycles, and number of cells per individual.","[('red alga', 'red algaes', 'red algae'), ('plastid', 'plastids'), ('endosymbiosi', 'endosymbioses',

116,stax-bio,23,Protists,2,m44616,Characteristics of Protists,"there are over 100,000 described living species of protists, and it is unclear how many undescribed species may exist. since many protists live as commensals or parasites in other organisms and these relationships are often species-specific, there is a huge potential for protist diversity that matches the diversity of hosts. as the catchall term for eukaryotic organisms that are not animal, plant, or fungi, it is not surprising that very few characteristics are common to all protists. the cells of protists are among the most elaborate of all cells. most protists are microscopic and unicellular, but some true multicellular forms exist. a few protists live as colonies that behave in some ways as a group of free-living cells and in other ways as a multicellular organism. still other protists are composed of enormous, multinucleate, single cells that look like amorphous blobs of slime, or in other cases, like ferns. in fact, many protist cells are multinucleated; in some species, the nuclei are different sizes and have distinct roles in protist cell function. single protist cells range in size from less than a micrometer to three meters in length to hectares. protist cells may be enveloped by animal-like cell membranes or plant-like cell walls. others are encased in glassy silica-based shells or wound with pellicles of interlocking protein strips. the pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor, preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion. protists exhibit many forms of nutrition and may be aerobic or anaerobic. protists that store energy by photosynthesis belong to a group of photoautotrophs and are characterized by the presence of chloroplasts. other protists are heterotrophic and consume organic materials (such as other organisms) to obtain nutrition. amoebas and some other heterotrophic protist species ingest particles by a process called phagocytosis, in which the cell membrane engulfs a food particle and brings it inward, pinching off an intracellular membranous sac, or vesicle, called a food vacuole ([link]). the vesicle containing the ingested particle, the phagosome, then fuses with a lysosome containing hydrolytic enzymes to produce a phagolysosome, and the food particle is broken down into small molecules that can diffuse into the cytoplasm and be used in cellular metabolism. undigested remains ultimately are expelled from the cell via exocytosis. subtypes of heterotrophs, called saprobes, absorb nutrients from dead organisms or their organic wastes. some protists can function as mixotrophs, obtaining nutrition by photoautotrophic or heterotrophic routes, depending on whether sunlight or organic nutrients are available. the majority of protists are motile, but different types of protists have evolved varied modes of movement ([link]). some protists have one or more flagella, which they rotate or whip. others are covered in rows or tufts of tiny cilia that they coordinately beat to swim. still others form cytoplasmic extensions called pseudopodia anywhere on the cell, anchor the pseudopodia to a substrate, and pull themselves forward. some protists can move toward or away from a stimulus, a movement referred to as taxis. movement toward light, termed phototaxis, is accomplished by coupling their locomotion strategy with a light-sensing organ. protists reproduce by a variety of mechanisms. most undergo some form of asexual reproduction, such as binary fission, to produce two daughter cells. in protists, binary fission can be divided into transverse or longitudinal, depending on the axis of orientation; sometimes paramecium exhibits this method. some protists such as the true slime molds exhibit multiple fission and simultaneously divide into many daughter cells. others produce tiny buds that go on to divide and grow to the size of the parental protist. sexual reproduction, involving meiosis and fertilization, is common among protists, and many protist species can switch from asexual to sexual reproduction when necessary. sexual reproduction is often associated with periods when nutrients are depleted or environmental changes occur. sexual reproduction may allow the protist to recombine genes and produce new variations of progeny that may be better suited to surviving in the new environment. however, sexual reproduction is often associated with resistant cysts that are a protective, resting stage. depending on their habitat, the cysts may be particularly resistant to temperature extremes, desiccation, or low ph. this strategy also allows certain protists to wait out stressors until their environment becomes more favorable for survival or until they are carried (such as by wind, water, or transport on a larger organism) to a different environment, because cysts exhibit virtually no cellular metabolism. protist life cycles range from simple to extremely elaborate. certain parasitic protists have complicated life cycles and must infect different host species at different developmental stages to complete their life cycle. some protists are unicellular in the haploid form and multicellular in the diploid form, a strategy employed by animals. other protists have multicellular stages in both haploid and diploid forms, a strategy called alternation of generations that is also used by plants. nearly all protists exist in some type of aquatic environment, including freshwater and marine environments, damp soil, and even snow. several protist species are parasites that infect animals or plants. a few protist species live on dead organisms or their wastes, and contribute to their decay. protists are extremely diverse in terms of their biological and ecological characteristics, partly because they are an artificial assemblage of phylogenetically unrelated groups. protists display highly varied cell structures, several types of reproductive strategies, virtually every possible type of nutrition, and varied habitats. most single-celled protists are motile, but these organisms use diverse structures for transportation.","[('protist life cycle', 'protist life cycles', 'protist lives cycle', 'protist lives cycles', 'protists life cycle', 'protists life cycles', 'protists lives cycle', 'protists lives cycles'), ('protist diversity', 'protist diversities'), ('protist metabolism', 'protist metabolisms'), ('photoautotroph', 'photoautotrophs'), ('protist cell structure', 'protist cell structures', 'protist cells structure', 'protist cells structures', 'protists cell structure', 'protists cell structures', 'protists cells structure', 'protists cells structures'), ('protist motility', 'protist motilities'), ('protistum', 'protistas', 'protista'), ('protist', 'protists'), ('protist habitat', 'protist habitats'), ('mixotroph', 'mixotrophs'), ('pellicle', 'pellicles')]"
117,stax-bio,23,Protists,3,m44617,Groups of Protists,"in the span of several decades, the kingdom protista has been disassembled because sequence analyses have revealed new genetic (and therefore evolutionary) relationships among these eukaryotes. moreover, protists that exhibit similar morphological features may have evolved analogous structures because of similar selective pressuresrather than because of recent common ancestry. this phenomenon, called convergent evolution, is one reason why protist classification is so challenging. the emerging classification scheme groups the entire domain eukaryota into six supergroups that contain all of the protists as well as animals, plants, and fungi that evolved from a common ancestor ([link]). the supergroups are believed to be monophyletic, meaning that all organisms within each supergroup are believed to have evolved from a single common ancestor, and thus all members are most closely related to each other than to organisms outside that group. there is still evidence lacking for the monophyly of some groups. the classification of eukaryotes is still in flux, and the six supergroups may be modified or replaced by a more appropriate hierarchy as genetic, morphological, and ecological data accumulate. keep in mind that the classification scheme presented here is just one of several hypotheses, and the true evolutionary relationships are still to be determined. when learning about protists, it is helpful to focus less on the nomenclature and more on the commonalities and differences that define the groups themselves. many of the protist species classified into the supergroup excavata are asymmetrical, single-celled organisms with a feeding groove excavated from one side. this supergroup includes heterotrophic predators, photosynthetic species, and parasites. its subgroups are the diplomonads, parabasalids, and euglenozoans. among the excavata are the diplomonads, which include the intestinal parasite, giardia lamblia ([link]). until recently, these protists were believed to lack mitochondria. mitochondrial remnant organelles, called mitosomes, have since been identified in diplomonads, but these mitosomes are essentially nonfunctional. diplomonads exist in anaerobic environments and use alternative pathways, such as glycolysis, to generate energy. each diplomonad cell has two identical nuclei and uses several flagella for locomotion. a second excavata subgroup, the parabasalids, also exhibits semi-functional mitochondria. in parabasalids, these structures function anaerobically and are called hydrogenosomes because they produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct. parabasalids move with flagella and membrane rippling. trichomonas vaginalis, a parabasalid that causes a sexually transmitted disease in humans, employs these mechanisms to transit through the male and female urogenital tracts. t. vaginalis causes trichamoniasis, which appears in an estimated 180 million cases worldwide each year. whereas men rarely exhibit symptoms during an infection with this protist, infected women may become more susceptible to secondary infection with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and may be more likely to develop cervical cancer. pregnant women infected with t. vaginalis are at an increased risk of serious complications, such as pre-term delivery. euglenozoans includes parasites, heterotrophs, autotrophs, and mixotrophs, ranging in size from 10 to 500 m. euglenoids move through their aquatic habitats using two long flagella that guide them toward light sources sensed by a primitive ocular organ called an eyespot. the familiar genus, euglena, encompasses some mixotrophic species that display a photosynthetic capability only when light is present. in the dark, the chloroplasts of euglena shrink up and temporarily cease functioning, and the cells instead take up organic nutrients from their environment. the human parasite, trypanosoma brucei, belongs to a different subgroup of euglenozoa, the kinetoplastids. the kinetoplastid subgroup is named after the kinetoplast, a dna mass carried within the single, oversized mitochondrion possessed by each of these cells. this subgroup includes several parasites, collectively called trypanosomes, which cause devastating human diseases and infect an insect species during a portion of their life cycle. t. brucei develops in the gut of the tsetse fly after the fly bites an infected human or other mammalian host. the parasite then travels to the insect salivary glands to be transmitted to another human or other mammal when the infected tsetse fly consumes another blood meal. t. brucei is common in central africa and is the causative agent of african sleeping sickness, a disease associated with severe chronic fatigue, coma, and can be fatal if left untreated. watch this video to see t. brucei swimming.

 current evidence suggests that species classified as chromalveolates are derived from a common ancestor that engulfed a photosynthetic red algal cell, which itself had already evolved chloroplasts from an endosymbiotic relationship with a photosynthetic prokaryote. therefore, the ancestor of chromalveolates is believed to have resulted from a secondary endosymbiotic event. however, some chromalveolates appear to have lost red alga-derived plastid organelles or lack plastid genes altogether. therefore, this supergroup should be considered a hypothesis-based working group that is subject to change. chromalveolates include very important photosynthetic organisms, such as diatoms, brown algae, and significant disease agents in animals and plants. the chromalveolates can be subdivided into alveolates and stramenopiles. a large body of data supports that the alveolates are derived from a shared common ancestor. the alveolates are named for the presence of an alveolus, or membrane-enclosed sac, beneath the cell membrane. the exact function of the alveolus is unknown, but it may be involved in osmoregulation. the alveolates are further categorized into some of the better-known protists: the dinoflagellates, the apicomplexans, and the ciliates. dinoflagellates exhibit extensive morphological diversity and can be photosynthetic, heterotrophic, or mixotrophic. many dinoflagellates are encased in interlocking plates of cellulose. two perpendicular flagella fit into the grooves between the cellulose plates, with one flagellum extending longitudinally and a second encircling the dinoflagellate ([link]). together, the flagella contribute to the characteristic spinning motion of dinoflagellates. these protists exist in freshwater and marine habitats, and are a component of plankton, the typically microscopic organisms that drift through the water and serve as a crucial food source for larger aquatic organisms. some dinoflagellates generate light, called bioluminescence, when they are jarred or stressed. large numbers of marine dinoflagellates (billions or trillions of cells per wave) can emit light and cause an entire breaking wave to twinkle or take on a brilliant blue color ([link]). for approximately 20 species of marine dinoflagellates, population explosions (also called blooms) during the summer months can tint the ocean with a muddy red color. this phenomenon is called a red tide, and it results from the abundant red pigments present in dinoflagellate plastids. in large quantities, these dinoflagellate species secrete an asphyxiating toxin that can kill fish, birds, and marine mammals. red tides can be massively detrimental to commercial fisheries, and humans who consume these protists may become poisoned. the apicomplexan protists are so named because their microtubules, fibrin, and vacuoles are asymmetrically distributed at one end of the cell in a structure called an apical complex ([link]). the apical complex is specialized for entry and infection of host cells. indeed, all apicomplexans are parasitic. this group includes the genus plasmodium, which causes malaria in humans. apicomplexan life cycles are complex, involving multiple hosts and stages of sexual and asexual reproduction. the ciliates, which include paramecium and tetrahymena, are a group of protists 10 to 3,000 micrometers in length that are covered in rows, tufts, or spirals of tiny cilia. by beating their cilia synchronously or in waves, ciliates can coordinate directed movements and ingest food particles. certain ciliates have fused cilia-based structures that function like paddles, funnels, or fins. ciliates also are surrounded by a pellicle, providing protection without compromising agility. the genus paramecium includes protists that have organized their cilia into a plate-like primitive mouth, called an oral groove, which is used to capture and digest bacteria ([link]). food captured in the oral groove enters a food vacuole, where it combines with digestive enzymes. waste particles are expelled by an exocytic vesicle that fuses at a specific region on the cell membrane, called the anal pore. in addition to a vacuole-based digestive system, paramecium also uses contractile vacuoles, which are osmoregulatory vesicles that fill with water as it enters the cell by osmosis and then contract to squeeze water from the cell. watch the video of the contractile vacuole of paramecium expelling water to keep the cell osmotically balanced.

 paramecium has two nuclei, a macronucleus and a micronucleus, in each cell. the micronucleus is essential for sexual reproduction, whereas the macronucleus directs asexual binary fission and all other biological functions. the process of sexual reproduction in paramecium underscores the importance of the micronucleus to these protists. paramecium and most other ciliates reproduce sexually by conjugation. this process begins when two different mating types of paramecium make physical contact and join with a cytoplasmic bridge ([link]). the diploid micronucleus in each cell then undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid micronuclei. three of these degenerate in each cell, leaving one micronucleus that then undergoes mitosis, generating two haploid micronuclei. the cells each exchange one of these haploid nuclei and move away from each other. a similar process occurs in bacteria that have plasmids. fusion of the haploid micronuclei generates a completely novel diploid pre-micronucleus in each conjugative cell. this pre-micronucleus undergoes three rounds of mitosis to produce eight copies, and the original macronucleus disintegrates. four of the eight pre-micronuclei become full-fledged micronuclei, whereas the other four perform multiple rounds of dna replication and go on to become new macronuclei. two cell divisions then yield four new paramecia from each original conjugative cell. the other subgroup of chromalveolates, the stramenopiles, includes photosynthetic marine algae and heterotrophic protists. the unifying feature of this group is the presence of a textured, or hairy, flagellum. many stramenopiles also have an additional flagellum that lacks hair-like projections ([link]). members of this subgroup range in size from single-celled diatoms to the massive and multicellular kelp. the diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic protists that encase themselves in intricately patterned, glassy cell walls composed of silicon dioxide in a matrix of organic particles ([link]). these protists are a component of freshwater and marine plankton. most species of diatoms reproduce asexually, although some instances of sexual reproduction and sporulation also exist. some diatoms exhibit a slit in their silica shell, called a raphe. by expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the raphe, the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in one direction. during periods of nutrient availability, diatom populations bloom to numbers greater than can be consumed by aquatic organisms. the excess diatoms die and sink to the sea floor where they are not easily reached by saprobes that feed on dead organisms. as a result, the carbon dioxide that the diatoms had consumed and incorporated into their cells during photosynthesis is not returned to the atmosphere. in general, this process by which carbon is transported deep into the ocean is described as the biological carbon pump, because carbon is pumped to the ocean depths where it is inaccessible to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. the biological carbon pump is a crucial component of the carbon cycle that maintains lower atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. like diatoms, golden algae are largely unicellular,  although some species can form large colonies. their characteristic gold color results from their extensive use of carotenoids, a group of photosynthetic pigments that are generally yellow or orange in color. golden algae are found in both freshwater and marine environments, where they form a major part of the plankton community.            the brown algae are primarily marine, multicellular organisms that are known colloquially as seaweeds. giant kelps are a type of brown algae. some brown algae have evolved specialized tissues that resemble terrestrial plants, with root-like holdfasts, stem-like stipes, and leaf-like blades that are capable of photosynthesis. the stipes of giant kelps are enormous, extending in some cases for 60 meters. a variety of algal life cycles exists, but the most complex is alternation of generations, in which both haploid and diploid stages involve multicellularity. compare this life cycle to that of humans, for instance. haploid gametes produced by meiosis (sperm and egg) combine in fertilization to generate a diploid zygote that undergoes many rounds of mitosis to produce a multicellular embryo and then a fetus. however, the individual sperm and egg themselves never become multicellular beings. terrestrial plants also have evolved alternation of generations. in the brown algae genus laminaria, haploid spores develop into multicellular gametophytes, which produce haploid gametes that combine to produce diploid organisms that then become multicellular organisms with a different structure from the haploid form ([link]). certain other organisms perform alternation of generations in which both the haploid and diploid forms look the same. the water molds, oomycetes (egg fungus), were so-named based on their fungus-like morphology, but molecular data have shown that the water molds are not closely related to fungi. the oomycetes are characterized by a cellulose-based cell wall and an extensive network of filaments that allow for nutrient uptake. as diploid spores, many oomycetes have two oppositely directed flagella (one hairy and one smooth) for locomotion. the oomycetes are nonphotosynthetic and include many saprobes and parasites. the saprobes appear as white fluffy growths on dead organisms ([link]). most oomycetes are aquatic, but some parasitize terrestrial plants. one plant pathogen is phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of late blight of potatoes, such as occurred in the nineteenth century irish potato famine. the rhizaria supergroup includes many of the amoebas, most of which have threadlike or needle-like pseudopodia ([link]). pseudopodia function to trap and engulf food particles and to direct movement in rhizarian protists. these pseudopods project outward from anywhere on the cell surface and can anchor to a substrate. the protist then transports its cytoplasm into the pseudopod, thereby moving the entire cell. this type of motion, called cytoplasmic streaming, is used by several diverse groups of protists as a means of locomotion or as a method to distribute nutrients and oxygen. take a look at this video to see cytoplasmic streaming in a green alga.


 foraminiferans, or forams, are unicellular heterotrophic protists, ranging from approximately 20 micrometers to several centimeters in length, and occasionally resembling tiny snails ([link]). as a group, the forams exhibit porous shells, called tests that are built from various organic materials and typically hardened with calcium carbonate. the tests may house photosynthetic algae, which the forams can harvest for nutrition. foram pseudopodia extend through the pores and allow the forams to move, feed, and gather additional building materials. typically, forams are associated with sand or other particles in marine or freshwater habitats. foraminiferans are also useful as indicators of pollution and changes in global weather patterns. a second subtype of rhizaria, the radiolarians, exhibit intricate exteriors of glassy silica with radial or bilateral symmetry ([link]). needle-like pseudopods supported by microtubules radiate outward from the cell bodies of these protists and function to catch food particles. the shells of dead radiolarians sink to the ocean floor, where they may accumulate in 100 meter-thick depths. preserved, sedimented radiolarians are very common in the fossil record. red algae and green algae are included in the supergroup archaeplastida. it was from a common ancestor of these protists that the land plants evolved, since their closest relatives are found in this group. molecular evidence supports that all archaeplastida are descendents of an endosymbiotic relationship between a heterotrophic protist and a cyanobacterium. the red and green algae include unicellular, multicellular, and colonial forms. red algae, or rhodophytes, are primarily multicellular, lack flagella, and range in size from microscopic, unicellular protists to large, multicellular forms grouped into the informal seaweed category. the red algae life cycle is an alternation of generations. some species of red algae contain phycoerythrins, photosynthetic accessory pigments that are red in color and outcompete the green tint of chlorophyll, making these species appear as varying shades of red. other protists classified as red algae lack phycoerythrins and are parasites. red algae are common in tropical waters where they have been detected at depths of 260 meters. other red algae exist in terrestrial or freshwater environments. the most abundant group of algae is the green algae. the green algae exhibit similar features to the land plants, particularly in terms of chloroplast structure. that this group of protists shared a relatively recent common ancestor with land plants is well supported. the green algae are subdivided into the chlorophytes and the charophytes. the charophytes are the closest living relatives to land plants and resemble them in morphology and reproductive strategies. charophytes are common in wet habitats, and their presence often signals a healthy ecosystem. the chlorophytes exhibit great diversity of form and function. chlorophytes primarily inhabit freshwater and damp soil, and are a common component of plankton. chlamydomonas is a simple, unicellular chlorophyte with a pear-shaped morphology and two opposing, anterior flagella that guide this protist toward light sensed by its eyespot. more complex chlorophyte species exhibit haploid gametes and spores that resemble chlamydomonas. the chlorophyte volvox is one of only a few examples of a colonial organism, which behaves in some ways like a collection of individual cells, but in other ways like the specialized cells of a multicellular organism ([link]). volvox colonies contain 500 to 60,000 cells, each with two flagella, contained within a hollow, spherical matrix composed of a gelatinous glycoprotein secretion. individual volvox cells move in a coordinated fashion and are interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges. only a few of the cells reproduce to create daughter colonies, an example of basic cell specialization in this organism. true multicellular organisms, such as the sea lettuce, ulva, are represented among the chlorophytes. in addition, some chlorophytes exist as large, multinucleate, single cells. species in the genus caulerpa exhibit flattened fern-like foliage and can reach lengths of 3 meters ([link]). caulerpa species undergo nuclear division, but their cells do not complete cytokinesis, remaining instead as massive and elaborate single cells. the amoebozoans characteristically exhibit pseudopodia that extend like tubes or flat lobes, rather than the hair-like pseudopodia of rhizarian amoeba ([link]). the amoebozoa include several groups of unicellular amoeba-like organisms that are free-living or parasites. a subset of the amoebozoans, the slime molds, has several morphological similarities to fungi that are thought to be the result of convergent evolution. for instance, during times of stress, some slime molds develop into spore-generating fruiting bodies, much like fungi. the slime molds are categorized on the basis of their life cycles into plasmodial or cellular types. plasmodial slime molds are composed of large, multinucleate cells and move along surfaces like an amorphous blob of slime during their feeding stage ([link]). food particles are lifted and engulfed into the slime mold as it glides along. upon maturation, the plasmodium takes on a net-like appearance with the ability to form fruiting bodies, or sporangia, during times of stress. haploid spores are produced by meiosis within the sporangia, and spores can be disseminated through the air or water to potentially land in more favorable environments. if this occurs, the spores germinate to form ameboid or flagellate haploid cells that can combine with each other and produce a diploid zygotic slime mold to complete the life cycle. the cellular slime molds function as independent amoeboid cells when nutrients are abundant ([link]). when food is depleted, cellular slime molds pile onto each other into a mass of cells that behaves as a single unit, called a slug. some cells in the slug contribute to a 23-millimeter stalk, drying up and dying in the process. cells atop the stalk form an asexual fruiting body that contains haploid spores. as with plasmodial slime molds, the spores are disseminated and can germinate if they land in a moist environment. one representative genus of the cellular slime molds is dictyostelium, which commonly exists in the damp soil of forests. view this video to see the formation of a fruiting body by a cellular slime mold.

 the opisthokonts include the animal-like choanoflagellates, which are believed to resemble the common ancestor of sponges and, in fact, all animals. choanoflagellates include unicellular and colonial forms, and number about 244 described species. these organisms exhibit a single, apical flagellum that is surrounded by a contractile collar composed of microvilli. the collar uses a similar mechanism to sponges to filter out bacteria for ingestion by the protist. the morphology of choanoflagellates was recognized early on as resembling the collar cells of sponges, and suggesting a possible relationship to animals. the mesomycetozoa form a small group of parasites, primarily of fish, and at least one form that can parasitize humans. their life cycles are poorly understood. these organisms are of special interest, because they appear to be so closely related to animals. in the past, they were grouped with fungi and other protists based on their morphology. the process of classifying protists into meaningful groups is ongoing, but genetic data in the past 20 years have clarified many relationships that were previously unclear or mistaken. the majority view at present is to order all eukaryotes into six supergroups: excavata, chromalveolata, rhizaria, archaeplastida, amoebozoa, and opisthokonta. the goal of this classification scheme is to create clusters of species that all are derived from a common ancestor. at present, the monophyly of some of the supergroups are better supported by genetic data than others. although tremendous variation exists within the supergroups, commonalities at the morphological, physiological, and ecological levels can be identified.","[('archaeplastida', 'archaeplastidas'), ('apicomplexan', 'apicomplexans'), ('dinoflagellate', 'dinoflagellates'), ('amoebozoon', 'amoebozoas', 'amoebozoa'), ('rhodophyte', 'rhodophytes'), ('cytoplasmic streaming', 'cytoplasmic streamings'), ('paramecium', 'parameciums'), ('kinetoplast', 'kinetoplasts'), ('parasite', 'parasites'), ('protist supergroup', 'protist supergroups'), ('hydrogenosome', 'hydrogenosomes'), ('plankton', 'planktons'), ('amoeba', 'amoebae'), ('diatom', 'diatoms'), ('rhizarium', 'rhizarias', 'rhizaria'), ('slime mold', 'slime molds'), ('stramenopile', 'stramenopiles'), ('laminarium', 'laminarias', 'laminaria'), ('excavatum', 'excavatas', 'excavata'), ('mitosome', 'mitosomes'), ('raphe', 'raphes'), ('biological carbon pump', 'biological carbon pumps', 'biological carbons pump', 'biological carbons pumps'), ('protist group', 'protist groups'), ('foraminiferan', 'foraminiferans'), ('parabasalid', 'parabasalids'), ('brown alga', 'brown algaes', 'brown algae'), ('green alga', 'green algaes', 'green algae'), ('foram', 'forams'), ('diplomonad', 'diplomonads'), ('chlorophyte', 'chlorophytes'), ('opisthokontum', 'opisthokontas', 'opisthokonta'), ('chromalveolatum', 'chromalveolatas', 'chromalveolata'), ('ciliate', 'ciliates'), ('water mold', 'water molds'), ('oomycete', 'oomycetes'), ('alveolate', 'alveolates'), ('protistum', 'protistas', 'protista'), ('protist', 'protists'), ('bioluminescence', 'bioluminescences'), ('radiolarian', 'radiolarians')]"
118,stax-bio,23,Protists,4,m44619,Ecology of Protists,"protists function in various ecological niches. whereas some protist species are essential components of the food chain and generators of biomass, others function in the decomposition of organic materials. still other protists are dangerous human pathogens or causative agents of devastating plant diseases. protists are essential sources of nutrition for many other organisms. in some cases, as in plankton, protists are consumed directly. alternatively, photosynthetic protists serve as producers of nutrition for other organisms. for instance, photosynthetic dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae use sunlight to fix inorganic carbon. in this symbiotic relationship, these protists provide nutrients for coral polyps ([link]) that house them, giving corals a boost of energy to secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton. in turn, the corals provide the protist with a protected environment and the compounds needed for photosynthesis. this type of symbiotic relationship is important in nutrient-poor environments. without dinoflagellate symbionts, corals lose algal pigments in a process called coral bleaching, and they eventually die. this explains why reef-building corals do not reside in waters deeper than 20 meters: insufficient light reaches those depths for dinoflagellates to photosynthesize. the protists themselves and their products of photosynthesis are essentialdirectly or indirectlyto the survival of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals ([link]). as primary producers, protists feed a large proportion of the worlds aquatic species. (on land, terrestrial plants serve as primary producers.) in fact, approximately one-quarter of the worlds photosynthesis is conducted by protists, particularly dinoflagellates, diatoms, and multicellular algae. protists do not create food sources only for sea-dwelling organisms. for instance, certain anaerobic parabasalid species exist in the digestive tracts of termites and wood-eating cockroaches, where they contribute an essential step in the digestion of cellulose ingested by these insects as they bore through wood. a pathogen is anything that causes disease. parasites live in or on an organism and harm the organism. a significant number of protists are pathogenic parasites that must infect other organisms to survive and propagate. protist parasites include the causative agents of malaria, african sleeping sickness, and waterborne gastroenteritis in humans. other protist pathogens prey on plants, effecting massive destruction of food crops. members of the genus plasmodium must colonize both a mosquito and a vertebrate to complete their life cycle. in vertebrates, the parasite develops in liver cells and goes on to infect red blood cells, bursting from and destroying the blood cells with each asexual replication cycle ([link]). of the four plasmodium species known to infect humans, p. falciparum accounts for 50 percent of all malaria cases and is the primary cause of disease-related fatalities in tropical regions of the world. in 2010, it was estimated that malaria caused between one-half and one million deaths, mostly in african children. during the course of malaria, p. falciparum can infect and destroy more than one-half of a humans circulating blood cells, leading to severe anemia. in response to waste products released as the parasites burst from infected blood cells, the host immune system mounts a massive inflammatory response with episodes of delirium-inducing fever as parasites lyse red blood cells, spilling parasite waste into the bloodstream. p. falciparum is transmitted to humans by the african malaria mosquito, anopheles gambiae. techniques to kill, sterilize, or avoid exposure to this highly aggressive mosquito species are crucial to malaria control. trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that is responsible for african sleeping sickness, confounds the human immune system by changing its thick layer of surface glycoproteins with each infectious cycle ([link]). the glycoproteins are identified by the immune system as foreign antigens, and a specific antibody defense is mounted against the parasite. however, t. brucei has thousands of possible antigens, and with each subsequent generation, the protist switches to a glycoprotein coating with a different molecular structure. in this way, t. brucei is capable of replicating continuously without the immune system ever succeeding in clearing the parasite. without treatment, t. brucei attacks red blood cells, causing the patient to lapse into a coma and eventually die. during epidemic periods, mortality from the disease can be high. greater surveillance and control measures lead to a reduction in reported cases; some of the lowest numbers reported in 50 years (fewer than 10,000 cases in all of sub-saharan africa) have happened since 2009. in latin america, another species, t. cruzi, is responsible for chagas disease. t. cruzi infections are mainly caused by a blood-sucking bug. the parasite inhabits heart and digestive system tissues in the chronic phase of infection, leading to malnutrition and heart failure due to abnormal heart rhythms. an estimated 10 million people are infected with chagas disease, and it caused 10,000 deaths in 2008. protist parasites of terrestrial plants include agents that destroy food crops. the oomycete plasmopara viticola parasitizes grape plants, causing a disease called downy mildew ([link]). grape plants infected with p. viticola appear stunted and have discolored, withered leaves. the spread of downy mildew nearly collapsed the french wine industry in the nineteenth century. phytophthora infestans is an oomycete responsible for potato late blight, which causes potato stalks and stems to decay into black slime ([link]). widespread potato blight caused by p. infestans precipitated the well-known irish potato famine in the nineteenth century that claimed the lives of approximately 1 million people and led to the emigration of at least 1 million more from ireland. late blight continues to plague potato crops in certain parts of the united states and russia, wiping out as much as 70 percent of crops when no pesticides are applied. the fungus-like protist saprobes are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter, such as dead organisms or their wastes. for instance, many types of oomycetes grow on dead animals or algae. saprobic protists have the essential function of returning inorganic nutrients to the soil and water. this process allows for new plant growth, which in turn generates sustenance for other organisms along the food chain. indeed, without saprobe species, such as protists, fungi, and bacteria, life would cease to exist as all organic carbon became tied up in dead organisms. protists function at several levels of the ecological food web: as primary producers, as direct food sources, and as decomposers. in addition, many protists are parasites of plants and animals that can cause deadly human diseases or destroy valuable crops.","[('plant parasite', 'plant parasites'), ('decomposition', 'decompositions'), ('trypanosome', 'trypanosomes'), ('protist ecology', 'protist ecologies'), ('protistum', 'protistas', 'protista'), ('plasmodium', 'plasmodiums'), ('trophic diversity', 'trophic diversities'), ('pathogen', 'pathogens'), ('protist', 'protists')]"
119,stax-bio,24,Fungi,0,m44620,Introduction,"the word fungus comes from the latin word for mushrooms.  indeed, the familiar mushroom is a reproductive structure used by many types of fungi. however, there are also many fungi species that don't produce mushrooms at all. being eukaryotes, a typical fungal cell contains a true nucleus and many membrane-bound organelles. the kingdom fungi includes an enormous variety of living organisms collectively referred to as eucomycota, or true fungi. while scientists have identified about 100,000 species of fungi, this is only a fraction of the 1.5 million species of fungus likely present on earth. edible mushrooms, yeasts, black mold, and the producer of the antibiotic penicillin, penicillium notatum, are all members of the kingdom fungi, which belongs to the domain eukarya. fungi, once considered plant-like organisms, are more closely related to animals than plants. fungi are not capable of photosynthesis: they are heterotrophic because they use complex organic compounds as sources of energy and carbon. some fungal organisms multiply only asexually, whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction with alternation of generations. most fungi produce a large number of spores, which are haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular,  haploid individuals. like bacteria, fungi play an essential role in ecosystems because they are decomposers and participate in the cycling of nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules. fungi often interact with other organisms, forming beneficial or mutualistic associations. for example most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi. the roots of the plant connect with the underground parts of the fungus forming mycorrhizae. through mycorrhizae, the fungus and plant exchange nutrients and water, greatly aiding the survival of both species alternatively, lichens are an association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner (usually an alga). fungi also cause serious infections in plants and animals. for example, dutch elm disease, which is caused by the fungus ophiostoma ulmi, is a particularly devastating type of fungal infestation that destroys many native species of elm (ulmus sp.) by infecting the trees vascular system. the elm bark beetle acts as a vector,  transmitting the disease from tree to tree. accidentally introduced in the 1900s, the fungus decimated elm trees across the continent. many european and asiatic elms are less susceptible to dutch elm disease than american elms. in humans, fungal infections are generally considered challenging to treat. unlike bacteria, fungi do not respond to traditional antibiotic therapy, since they are eukaryotes. fungal infections may prove deadly for individuals with compromised immune systems. fungi have many commercial applications. the food industry uses yeasts in baking, brewing, and cheese and wine making. many industrial compounds are byproducts of fungal fermentation. fungi are the source of many commercial enzymes and antibiotics.","[('plant parasite', 'plant parasites'), ('fungi ecology', 'fungi ecologies'), ('decomposer',

120,stax-bio,24,Fungi,1,m44622,Characteristics of Fungi,"although humans have used yeasts and mushrooms since prehistoric times, until recently, the biology of fungi was poorly understood. up until the mid-20th century, many scientists classified fungi as plants. fungi, like plants, arose mostly sessile and seemingly rooted in place. they possess a stem-like structure similar to plants, as well as having a root-like fungal mycelium in the soil. in addition, their mode of nutrition was poorly understood. progress in the field of fungal biology was the result of mycology: the scientific study of fungi. based on fossil evidence, fungi appeared in the pre-cambrian era, about 450 million years ago. molecular biology analysis of the fungal genome demonstrates that fungi are more closely related to animals than plants. they are a polyphyletic group of organisms that share characteristics, rather than sharing a single common ancestor. mycologistmycologists are biologists who study fungi. mycology is a branch of microbiology, and many mycologists start their careers with a degree in microbiology. to become a mycologist, a bachelor's degree in a biological science (preferably majoring in microbiology) and a master's degree in mycology are minimally necessary. mycologists can specialize in taxonomy and fungal genomics, molecular and cellular biology, plant pathology, biotechnology, or biochemistry. some medical microbiologists concentrate on the study of infectious diseases caused by fungi (mycoses). mycologists collaborate with zoologists and plant pathologists to identify and control difficult fungal infections, such as the devastating chestnut blight, the mysterious decline in frog populations in many areas of the world, or the deadly epidemic called white nose syndrome, which is decimating bats in the eastern united states. government agencies hire mycologists as research scientists and technicians to monitor the health of crops, national parks, and national forests. mycologists are also employed in the private sector by companies that develop chemical and biological control products or new agricultural products, and by companies that provide disease control services. because of the key role played by fungi in the fermentation of alcohol and the preparation of many important foods, scientists with a good understanding of fungal physiology routinely work in the food technology industry. oenology, the science of wine making, relies not only on the knowledge of grape varietals and soil composition, but also on a solid understanding of the characteristics of the wild yeasts that thrive in different wine-making regions. it is possible to purchase yeast strains isolated from specific grape-growing regions. the great french chemist and microbiologist, louis pasteur, made many of his essential discoveries working on the humble brewers yeast, thus discovering the process of fermentation. fungi are eukaryotes, and as such, have a complex cellular organization. as eukaryotes, fungal cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus. the dna in the nucleus is wrapped around histone proteins, as is observed in other eukaryotic cells. a few types of fungi have structures comparable to bacterial plasmids (loops of dna); however, the horizontal transfer of genetic information from one mature bacterium to another rarely occurs in fungi. fungal cells also contain mitochondria and a complex system of internal membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus. unlike plant cells, fungal cells do not have chloroplasts or chlorophyll. many fungi display bright colors arising from other cellular pigments, ranging from red to green to black. the poisonous amanita muscaria (fly agaric) is recognizable by its bright red cap with white patches ([link]). pigments in fungi are associated with the cell wall and play a protective role against ultraviolet radiation. some fungal pigments are toxic. like plant cells, fungal cells have a thick cell wall. the rigid layers of fungal cell walls contain complex polysaccharides called chitin and glucans. chitin, also found in the exoskeleton of insects, gives structural strength to the cell walls of fungi. the wall protects the cell from desiccation and predators. fungi have plasma membranes similar to other eukaryotes, except that the structure is stabilized by ergosterol: a steroid molecule that replaces the cholesterol found in animal cell membranes. most members of the kingdom fungi are nonmotile. flagella are produced only by the gametes in the primitive phylum chytridiomycota. the vegetative body of a fungus is a unicellular or multicellular thallus. dimorphic fungi can change from the unicellular to multicellular state depending on environmental conditions. unicellular fungi are generally referred to as yeasts. saccharomyces cerevisiae (bakers yeast) and candida species (the agents of thrush, a common fungal infection) are examples of unicellular fungi ([link]). most fungi are multicellular organisms. they display two distinct morphological stages: the vegetative and reproductive. the vegetative stage consists of a tangle of slender thread-like structures called hyphae (singular, hypha), whereas the reproductive stage can be more conspicuous. the mass of hyphae is a mycelium ([link]). it can grow on a surface, in soil or decaying material, in a liquid, or even on living tissue. although individual hyphae must be observed under a microscope, the mycelium of a fungus can be very large, with some species truly being the fungus humongous. the giant armillaria solidipes (honey mushroom) is considered the largest organism on earth, spreading across more than 2,000 acres of underground soil in eastern oregon; it is estimated to be at least 2,400 years old. most fungal hyphae are divided into separate cells by endwalls called septa (singular, septum) ([link]a, c). in most phyla of fungi, tiny holes in the septa allow for the rapid flow of nutrients and small molecules from cell to cell along the hypha. they are described as perforated septa. the hyphae in bread molds (which belong to the phylum zygomycota) are not separated by septa. instead, they are formed by large cells containing many nuclei, an arrangement described as coenocytic hyphae ([link]b). fungi thrive in environments that are moist and slightly acidic, and can grow with or without light. they vary in their oxygen requirement. most fungi are obligate aerobes, requiring oxygen to survive. other species, such as the chytridiomycota that reside in the rumen of cattle, are are obligate anaerobes, in that they only use anaerobic respiration because oxygen will disrupt their metabolism or kill them.  yeasts are intermediate, being faculative anaerobes. this means that they grow best in the presence of oxygen using aerobic respiration, but can survive using anaerobic respiration when oxygen is not available. the alcohol produced from yeast fermentation is used in wine and beer production. like animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they use complex organic compounds as a source of carbon, rather than fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as do some bacteria and most plants. in addition, fungi do not fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. like animals, they must obtain it from their diet. however, unlike most animals, which ingest food and then digest it internally in specialized organs, fungi perform these steps in the reverse order; digestion precedes ingestion. first, exoenzymes are transported out of the hyphae, where they process nutrients in the environment. then, the smaller molecules produced by this external digestion are absorbed through the large surface area of the mycelium. as with animal cells, the polysaccharide of storage is glycogen, rather than starch, as found in plants. fungi are mostly saprobes (saprophyte is an equivalent term): organisms that derive nutrients from decaying organic matter. they obtain their nutrients from dead or decomposing organic matter: mainly plant material. fungal exoenzymes are able to break down insoluble polysaccharides, such as the cellulose and lignin of dead wood, into readily absorbable glucose molecules. the carbon, nitrogen, and other elements are thus released into the environment. because of their varied metabolic pathways, fungi fulfill an important ecological role and are being investigated as potential tools in bioremediation. for example, some species of fungi can be used to break down diesel oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). other species take up heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead. some fungi are parasitic, infecting either plants or animals. smut and dutch elm disease affect plants, whereas athletes foot and candidiasis (thrush) are medically important fungal infections in humans. in environments poor in nitrogen, some fungi resort to predation of nematodes (small non-segmented roundworms). species of arthrobotrys fungi have a number of mechanisms to trap nematodes. one mechanism involves constricting rings within the network of hyphae. the rings swell when they touch the nematode, gripping it in a tight hold. the fungus penetrates the tissue of the worm by extending specialized hyphae called haustoria. many parasitic fungi possess haustoria, as these structures penetrate the tissues of the host, release digestive enzymes within the host's body, and absorb the digested nutrients.    fungi reproduce sexually and/or asexually. perfect fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually, while the so-called imperfect fungi reproduce only asexually (by mitosis). in both sexual and asexual reproduction, fungi produce spores that disperse from the parent organism by either floating on the wind or hitching a ride on an animal. fungal spores are smaller and lighter than plant seeds. the giant puffball mushroom bursts open and releases trillions of spores. the huge number of spores released increases the likelihood of landing in an environment that will support growth ([link]). fungi reproduce asexually by fragmentation, budding, or producing spores. fragments of hyphae can grow new colonies. somatic cells in yeast form buds. during budding (a type of cytokinesis), a bulge forms on the side of the cell, the nucleus divides mitotically, and the bud ultimately detaches itself from the mother cell ([link]). the most common mode of asexual reproduction is through the formation of asexual spores, which are produced by one parent only (through mitosis) and are genetically identical to that parent ([link]). spores allow fungi to expand their distribution and colonize new environments. they may be released from the parent thallus either outside or within a special reproductive sac called a sporangium. there are many types of asexual spores. conidiospores are unicellular or multicellular spores that are released directly from the tip or side of the hypha. other asexual spores originate in the fragmentation of a hypha to form single cells that are released as spores; some of these have a thick wall surrounding the fragment. yet others bud off the vegetative parent cell. sporangiospores are produced in a sporangium ([link]). sexual reproduction introduces genetic variation into a population of fungi. in fungi, sexual reproduction often occurs in response to adverse environmental conditions. during sexual reproduction, two mating types are produced. when both mating types are present in the same mycelium, it is called homothallic, or self-fertile. heterothallic mycelia require two different, but compatible, mycelia to reproduce sexually. although there are many variations in fungal sexual reproduction, all include the following three stages ([link]). first, during plasmogamy (literally, marriage or union of cytoplasm), two haploid cells fuse, leading to a dikaryotic stage where two haploid nuclei coexist in a single cell. during karyogamy (nuclear marriage), the haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid zygote nucleus. finally, meiosis takes place in the gametangia (singular, gametangium) organs, in which gametes of different mating types are generated. at this stage, spores are disseminated into the environment. fungi are eukaryotic organisms that appeared on land more than 450 million years ago. they are heterotrophs and contain neither photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll, nor organelles such as chloroplasts. because fungi feed on decaying and dead matter, they are saprobes. fungi are important decomposers that release essential elements into the environment. external enzymes digest nutrients that are absorbed by the body of the fungus, which is called a thallus. a thick cell wall made of chitin surrounds the cell. fungi can be unicellular as yeasts, or develop a network of filaments called a mycelium, which is often described as mold. most species multiply by asexual and sexual reproductive cycles and display an alternation of generations. another group of fungi do not have a sexual cycle. sexual reproduction involves plasmogamy (the fusion of the cytoplasm), followed by karyogamy (the fusion of nuclei). meiosis regenerates haploid individuals, resulting in haploid spores.","[('mycology', 'mycologies'), ('sporangium', 'sporangiums'), ('plasmogamy', 'plasmogamies'), ('fungi nutrition', 'fungi nutritions'), ('karyogamy', 'karyogamies'), ('fungi sexual reproduction', 'fungi sexual reproductions', 'fungis sexual reproduction', 'fungis sexual reproductions'), ('heterothallic', 'heterothallics'), ('fungu', 'fungi', 'fungus'), ('mycelium', 'myceliums'), ('fungi asexual reproduction', 'fungi asexual reproductions', 'fungis asexual reproduction', 'fungis asexual reproductions'), ('fungi cell structure', 'fungi cell structures', 'fungi cells structure', 'fungi cells structures', 'fungis cell structure', 'fungis cell structures', 'fungis cells structure', 'fungis cells structures'), ('hypha', 'hyphaes', 'hyphae'), ('homothallic', 'homothallics'), ('coenocytic hypha', 'coenocytic hyphas'), ('hypha', 'hyphas'), ('fungi reproduction', 'fungi reproductions'), ('mycologist', 'mycologists'), ('fungi growth', 'fungi growths'), ('yeast', 'yeasts'), ('thallu', 'thalluss', 'thallus'), ('fungi characteristic', 'fungi characteristicss', 'fungi characteristics'), ('saprobe', 'saprobes'), ('septum', 'septums'), ('haustorium', 'haustorias', 'haustoria'), ('fungi', 'fungis')]"
121,stax-bio,24,Fungi,2,m44625,Classifications of Fungi,"the kingdom fungi contains five major phyla that were established according to their mode of sexual reproduction or using molecular data.  polyphyletic, unrelated fungi that reproduce without a sexual cycle, are placed for convenience in a sixth group called a form phylum. not all mycologists agree with this scheme. rapid advances in molecular biology and the sequencing of 18s rrna (a part of rna) continue to show new and different relationships between the various categories of fungi. the five true phyla of fungi are the chytridiomycota (chytrids), the zygomycota (conjugated fungi), the ascomycota (sac fungi), the basidiomycota (club fungi) and the recently described phylum glomeromycota.  an older classification scheme grouped fungi that strictly use asexual reproduction into deuteromycota, a group that is no longer in use. note:  -mycota is used to designate a phylum while -mycetes formally denotes a class or is used informally to refer to all members of the phylum. the only class in the phylum chytridiomycota is the chytridiomycetes. the chytrids are the simplest and most primitive eumycota, or true fungi. the evolutionary record shows that the first recognizable chytrids appeared during the late pre-cambrian period, more than 500million years ago. like all fungi, chytrids have chitin in their cell walls, but one group of chytrids has both cellulose and chitin in the cell wall. most chytrids are unicellular; a few form multicellular organisms and hyphae, which have no septa between cells (coenocytic). they produce gametes and diploid zoospores that swim with the help of a single flagellum. the ecological habitat and cell structure of chytrids have much in common with protists. chytrids usually live in aquatic environments, although some species live on land. some species thrive as parasites on plants, insects, or amphibians ([link]), while others are saprobes. the chytrid species allomyces is well characterized as an experimental organism. its reproductive cycle includes both asexual and sexual phases. allomyces produces diploid or haploid flagellated zoospores in a sporangium. the zygomycetes are a relatively small group of fungi belonging to the phylum zygomycota. they include the familiar bread mold, rhizopus stolonifer, which rapidly propagates on the surfaces of breads, fruits, and vegetables. most species are saprobes, living off decaying organic material; a few are parasites, particularly of insects. zygomycetes play a considerable commercial role. the metabolic products of other species of rhizopus are intermediates in the synthesis of semi-synthetic steroid hormones. zygomycetes have a thallus of coenocytic hyphae in which the nuclei are haploid when the organism is in the vegetative stage. the fungi usually reproduce asexually by producing sporangiospores ([link]). the black tips of bread mold are the swollen sporangia packed with black spores ([link]). when spores land on a suitable substrate, they germinate and produce a new mycelium. sexual reproduction starts when conditions become unfavorable. two opposing mating strains (type + and type ) must be in close proximity for gametangia from the hyphae to be produced and fuse, leading to karyogamy. the developing diploid zygospores have thick coats that protect them from desiccation and other hazards. they may remain dormant until environmental conditions are favorable. when the zygospore germinates, it undergoes meiosis and produces haploid spores, which will, in turn, grow into a new organism. this form of sexual reproduction in fungi is called conjugation (although it differs markedly from conjugation in bacteria and protists), giving rise to the name conjugated fungi. the majority of known fungi belong to the phylum ascomycota, which is characterized by the formation of an ascus (plural, asci), a sac-like structure that contains haploid ascospores. many ascomycetes are of commercial importance. some play a beneficial role, such as the yeasts used in baking, brewing, and wine fermentation, plus truffles and morels, which are held as gourmet delicacies. aspergillus oryzae is used in the fermentation of rice to produce sake. other ascomycetes parasitize plants and animals, including humans. for example, fungal pneumonia poses a significant threat to aids patients who have a compromised immune system. ascomycetes not only infest and destroy crops directly; they also produce poisonous secondary metabolites that make crops unfit for consumption. filamentous ascomycetes produce hyphae divided by perforated septa, allowing streaming of cytoplasm from one cell to the other. conidia and asci, which are used respectively for asexual and sexual reproductions, are usually separated from the vegetative hyphae by blocked (non-perforated) septa. asexual reproduction is frequent and involves the production of conidiophores that release haploid conidiospores ([link]). sexual reproduction starts with the development of special hyphae from either one of two types of mating strains ([link]). the male strain produces an antheridium and the female strain develops an ascogonium. at fertilization, the antheridium and the ascogonium combine in plasmogamy without nuclear fusion. special ascogenous hyphae arise, in which pairs of nuclei migrate: one from the male strain and one from the female strain. in each ascus, two or more haploid ascospores fuse their nuclei in karyogamy. during sexual reproduction, thousands of asci fill a fruiting body called the ascocarp. the diploid nucleus gives rise to haploid nuclei by meiosis. the ascospores are then released, germinate, and form hyphae that are disseminated in the environment and start new mycelia ([link]). the fungi in the phylum basidiomycota are easily recognizable under a light microscope by their club-shaped fruiting bodies called basidia (singular, basidium), which are the swollen terminal cell of a hypha.  the basidia, which are the reproductive organs of these fungi, are often contained within the familiar mushroom, commonly seen in fields after rain, on the supermarket shelves, and growing on your lawn ([link]). these mushroom-producing basidiomyces are sometimes referred to as gill fungi because of the presence of gill-like structures on the underside of the cap. the gills are actually compacted hyphae on which the basidia are borne. 

this group also includes shelf fungus, which cling to the bark of trees like small shelves. in addition, the basidiomycota includes smuts and rusts, which are important plant pathogens; toadstools, and shelf fungi stacked on tree trunks. most edible fungi belong to the phylum basidiomycota; however, some basidiomycetes produce deadly toxins. for example, cryptococcus neoformans causes severe respiratory illness. the lifecycle of basidiomycetes includes alternation of generations ([link]). spores are generally produced through sexual reproduction, rather than asexual reproduction. the club-shaped basidium carries spores called basidiospores. in the basidium, nuclei of two different mating strains fuse (karyogamy), giving rise to a diploid zygote that then undergoes meiosis. the haploid nuclei migrate into basidiospores, which germinate and generate monokaryotic hyphae. the mycelium that results is called a primary mycelium. mycelia of different mating strains can combine and produce a secondary mycelium that contains haploid nuclei of two different mating strains. this is the dikaryotic stage of the basidiomyces lifecyle and and it is the dominant stage. eventually, the secondary mycelium generates a basidiocarp, which is a fruiting body that protrudes from the groundthis is what we think of as a mushroom. the basidiocarp bears the developing basidia on the gills under its cap. imperfect fungithose that do not display a sexual phaseuse to be classified in the form phylum deuteromycota, , a classification group no longer used in the present, ever-developing classification of organisms. while deuteromycota use to be a classification group, recent moleclular analysis has shown that the members classified in this group belong to the ascomycota or the basidiomycota classifications. since they do not possess the sexual structures that are used to classify other fungi, they are less well described in comparison to other members. most members live on land, with a few aquatic exceptions. they form visible mycelia with a fuzzy appearance and are commonly known as mold. reproduction of the fungi in this group is strictly asexual and occurs mostly by production of asexual conidiospores ([link]). some hyphae may recombine and form heterokaryotic hyphae. genetic recombination is known to take place between the different nuclei. the fungi in this group have a large impact on everyday human life. the food industry relies on them for ripening some cheeses. the blue veins in roquefort cheese and the white crust on camembert are the result of fungal growth. the antibiotic penicillin was originally discovered on an overgrown petri plate, on which a colony of penicillium fungi killed the bacterial growth surrounding it. other fungi in this group cause serious diseases, either directly as parasites (which infect both plants and humans), or as producers of potent toxic compounds, as seen in the aflatoxins released by fungi of the genus aspergillus. the glomeromycota is a newly established phylum which comprises about 230 species that all live in close association with the roots of trees. fossil records indicate that trees and their root symbionts share a long evolutionary history.  it appears that all members of this family form arbuscular mycorrhizae: the hyphae interact with the root cells forming a mutually beneficial association where the plants supply the carbon source and energy in the form of carbohydrates to the fungus, and the fungus supplies essential minerals from the soil to the plant. the glomeromycetes do not reproduce sexually and do not survive without the presence of plant roots. although they have coenocytic hyphae like the zygomycetes, they do not form zygospores. dna analysis shows that all glomeromycetes probably descended from a common ancestor, making them a monophyletic lineage.   chytridiomycota (chytrids) are considered the most primitive group of fungi. they are mostly aquatic, and their gametes are the only fungal cells known to have flagella. they reproduce both sexually and asexually; the asexual spores are called zoospores. zygomycota (conjugated fungi) produce non-septated hyphae with many nuclei. their hyphae fuse during sexual reproduction to produce a zygospore in a zygosporangium. ascomycota (sac fungi) form spores in sacs called asci during sexual reproduction. asexual reproduction is their most common form of reproduction. basidiomycota (club fungi) produce showy fruiting bodies that contain basidia in the form of clubs. spores are stored in the basidia. most familiar mushrooms belong to this division. fungi that have no known sexual cycle were classified in the form phylum deuteromycota, which the present classification puts in the phyla ascomycota and basidiomycota. glomeromycota form tight associations (called mycorrhizae) with the roots of plants.","[('basidiomycotum', 'basidiomycotas', 'basidiomycota'), ('zygomycotum', 'zygomycotas', 'zygomycota'), ('club fungi', 'club fungis'), ('sac fungi', 'sac fungis'), ('basidiocarp', 'basidiocarps'), ('mold', 'molds'), ('imperfect fungi', 'imperfect fungis'), ('conjugated fungi', 'conjugated fungis'), ('chytridiomycotum', 'chytridiomycotas', 'chytridiomycota'), ('zygomycete', 'zygomycetes'), ('glomeromycotum', 'glomeromycotas', 'glomeromycota'), ('asocarp', 'asocarps'), ('asomycotum', 'asomycotas', 'asomycota'), ('chytrid', 'chytrids'), ('fungi', 'fungis'), ('fungu', 'fungi', 'fungus'), ('zygospore', 'zygospores'), ('basidium', 'basidiums'), ('deuteromycotum', 'deuteromycotas', 'deuteromycota')]"
122,stax-bio,24,Fungi,3,m44632,Ecology of Fungi,"fungi play a crucial role in the balance of ecosystems. they colonize most habitats on earth, preferring dark, moist conditions. they can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, such as the tundra, thanks to a most successful symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms like algae to produce lichens. fungi are not obvious in the way large animals or tall trees appear. yet, like bacteria, they are the major decomposers of nature. with their versatile metabolism, fungi break down organic matter, which would not otherwise be recycled. although fungi are primarily associated with humid and cool environments that provide a supply of organic matter, they colonize a surprising diversity of habitats, from seawater to human skin and mucous membranes. chytrids are found primarily in aquatic environments. other fungi, such as coccidioides immitis, which causes pneumonia when its spores are inhaled, thrive in the dry and sandy soil of the southwestern united states. fungi that parasitize coral reefs live in the ocean. however, most members of the kingdom fungi grow on the forest floor, where the dark and damp environment is rich in decaying debris from plants and animals. in these environments, fungi play a major role as decomposers and recyclers, making it possible for members of the other kingdoms to be supplied with nutrients and live. the food web would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter ([link]). some elementssuch as nitrogen and phosphorusare required in large quantities by biological systems, and yet are not abundant in the environment. the action of fungi releases these elements from decaying matter, making them available to other living organisms. trace elements present in low amounts in many habitats are essential for growth, and would remain tied up in rotting organic matter if fungi and bacteria did not return them to the environment via their metabolic activity. the ability of fungi to degrade many large and insoluble molecules is due to their mode of nutrition. as seen earlier, digestion precedes ingestion. fungi produce a variety of exoenzymes to digest nutrients. the enzymes are either released into the substrate or remain bound to the outside of the fungal cell wall. large molecules are broken down into small molecules, which are transported into the cell by a system of protein carriers embedded in the cell membrane. because the movement of small molecules and enzymes is dependent on the presence of water, active growth depends on a relatively high percentage of moisture in the environment. as saprobes, fungi help maintain a sustainable ecosystem for the animals and plants that share the same habitat. in addition to replenishing the environment with nutrients, fungi interact directly with other organisms in beneficial, and sometimes damaging, ways ([link]). symbiosis is the ecological interaction between two organisms that live together. the definition does not describe the quality of the interaction. when both members of the association benefit, the symbiotic relationship is called mutualistic. fungi form mutualistic associations with many types of organisms, including cyanobacteria, algae, plants, and animals. one of the most remarkable associations between fungi and plants is the establishment of mycorrhizae. mycorrhiza, which comes from the greek words myco meaning fungus and rhizo meaning root, refers to the association between vascular plant roots and their symbiotic fungi. somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of all plant species have mycorrhizal partners. in a mycorrhizal association, the fungal mycelia use their extensive network of hyphae and large surface area in contact with the soil to channel water and minerals from the soil into the plant. in exchange, the plant supplies the products of photosynthesis to fuel the metabolism of the fungus. there are a number of types of mycorrhizae. ectomycorrhizae (outside mycorrhiza) depend on fungi enveloping the roots in a sheath (called a mantle) and a hartig net of hyphae that extends into the roots between cells ([link]). the fungal partner can belong to the ascomycota, basidiomycota or zygomycota. in a second type, the glomeromycete fungi form vesiculararbuscular interactions with arbuscular mycorrhiza (sometimes called endomycorrhizae). in these mycorrhiza, the fungi form arbuscules that penetrate root cells and are the site of the metabolic exchanges between the fungus and the host plant ([link] and [link]). the arbuscules (from the latin for little trees) have a shrub-like appearance. orchids rely on a third type of mycorrhiza. orchids are epiphytes that form small seeds without much storage to sustain germination and growth. their seeds will not germinate without a mycorrhizal partner (usually a basidiomycete). after nutrients in the seed are depleted, fungal symbionts support the growth of the orchid by providing necessary carbohydrates and minerals. some orchids continue to be mycorrhizal throughout their lifecycle. other examples of fungusplant mutualism include the endophytes: fungi that live inside tissue without damaging the host plant. endophytes release toxins that repel herbivores, or confer resistance to environmental stress factors, such as infection by microorganisms, drought, or heavy metals in soil. coevolution of land plants and mycorrhizaemycorrhizae are the mutually beneficial symbiotic association between roots of vascular plants and fungi. a well-accepted theory proposes that fungi were instrumental in the evolution of the root system in plants and contributed to the success of angiosperms. the bryophytes (mosses and liverworts), which are considered the most primitive plants and the first to survive on dry land, do not have a true root system; some have vesiculararbuscular mycorrhizae and some do not. they depend on a simple rhizoid (an underground organ) and cannot survive in dry areas. true roots appeared in vascular plants. vascular plants that developed a system of thin extensions from the rhizoids (found in mosses) are thought to have had a selective advantage because they had a greater surface area of contact with the fungal partners than the mosses and liverworts, thus availing themselves of more nutrients in the ground. fossil records indicate that fungi preceded plants on dry land. the first association between fungi and photosynthetic organisms on land involved moss-like plants and endophytes. these early associations developed before roots appeared in plants. slowly, the benefits of the endophyte and rhizoid interactions for both partners led to present-day mycorrhizae; up to about 90 percent of todays vascular plants have associations with fungi in their rhizosphere. the fungi involved in mycorrhizae display many characteristics of primitive fungi; they produce simple spores, show little diversification, do not have a sexual reproductive cycle, and cannot live outside of a mycorrhizal association. the plants benefited from the association because mycorrhizae allowed them to move into new habitats because of increased uptake of nutrients, and this gave them a selective advantage over plants that did not establish symbiotic relationships. lichens display a range of colors and textures ([link]) and can survive in the most unusual and hostile habitats. they cover rocks, gravestones, tree bark, and the ground in the tundra where plant roots cannot penetrate. lichens can survive extended periods of drought, when they become completely desiccated, and then rapidly become active once water is available again. lichens are not a single organism, but rather an example of a mutualism, in which a fungus (usually a member of the ascomycota or basidiomycota phyla) lives in close contact with a photosynthetic organism (a eukaryotic alga or a prokaryotic cyanobacterium) ([link]). generally, neither the fungus nor the photosynthetic organism can survive alone outside of the symbiotic relationship. the body of a lichen, referred to as a thallus, is formed of hyphae wrapped around the photosynthetic partner. the photosynthetic organism provides carbon and energy in the form of carbohydrates. some cyanobacteria fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, contributing nitrogenous compounds to the association. in return, the fungus supplies minerals and protection from dryness and excessive light by encasing the algae in its mycelium. the fungus also attaches the symbiotic organism to the substrate. the thallus of lichens grows very slowly, expanding its diameter a few millimeters per year. both the fungus and the alga participate in the formation of dispersal units for reproduction. lichens produce soredia, clusters of algal cells surrounded by mycelia. soredia are dispersed by wind and water and form new lichens. lichens are extremely sensitive to air pollution, especially to abnormal levels of nitrogen and sulfur. the u.s. forest service and national park service can monitor air quality by measuring the relative abundance and health of the lichen population in an area. lichens fulfill many ecological roles. caribou and reindeer eat lichens, and they provide cover for small invertebrates that hide in the mycelium. in the production of textiles, weavers used lichens to dye wool for many centuries until the advent of synthetic dyes. fungi have evolved mutualisms with numerous insects in phylum arthropoda: jointed, legged invertebrates. arthropods depend on the fungus for protection from predators and pathogens, while the fungus obtains nutrients and a way to disseminate spores into new environments. the association between species of basidiomycota and scale insects is one example. the fungal mycelium covers and protects the insect colonies. the scale insects foster a flow of nutrients from the parasitized plant to the fungus. in a second example, leaf-cutting ants of central and south america literally farm fungi. they cut disks of leaves from plants and pile them up in gardens ([link]). fungi are cultivated in these disk gardens, digesting the cellulose in the leaves that the ants cannot break down. once smaller sugar molecules are produced and consumed by the fungi, the fungi in turn become a meal for the ants. the insects also patrol their garden, preying on competing fungi. both ants and fungi benefit from the association. the fungus receives a steady supply of leaves and freedom from competition, while the ants feed on the fungi they cultivate. animal dispersal is important for some fungi because an animal may carry spores considerable distances from the source. fungal spores are rarely completely degraded in the gastrointestinal tract of an animal, and many are able to germinate when they are passed in the feces. some dung fungi actually require passage through the digestive system of herbivores to complete their lifecycle. the black trufflea prized gourmet delicacyis the fruiting body of an underground mushroom. almost all truffles are ectomycorrhizal, and are usually found in close association with trees. animals eat truffles and disperse the spores. in italy and france, truffle hunters use female pigs to sniff out truffles. female pigs are attracted to truffles because the fungus releases a volatile compound closely related to a pheromone produced by male pigs. fungi have colonized nearly all environments on earth, but are frequently found in cool, dark, moist places with a supply of decaying material. fungi are saprobes that decompose organic matter. many successful mutualistic relationships involve a fungus and another organism. many fungi establish complex mycorrhizal associations with the roots of plants. some ants farm fungi as a supply of food. lichens are a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic organism, usually an alga or cyanobacterium. the photosynthetic organism provides energy derived from light and carbohydrates, while the fungus supplies minerals and protection. some animals that consume fungi help disseminate spores over long distances.","[('coevolution of plant

123,stax-bio,24,Fungi,4,m44628,Fungal Parasites and Pathogens,"parasitism describes a symbiotic relationship in which one member of the association benefits at the expense of the other. both parasites and pathogens harm the host; however, the pathogen causes a disease, whereas the parasite usually does not. commensalism occurs when one member benefits without affecting the other. the production of sufficient good-quality crops is essential to human existence. plant diseases have ruined crops, bringing widespread famine. many plant pathogens are fungi that cause tissue decay and eventual death of the host ([link]). in addition to destroying plant tissue directly, some plant pathogens spoil crops by producing potent toxins. fungi are also responsible for food spoilage and the rotting of stored crops. for example, the fungus claviceps purpurea causes ergot, a disease of cereal crops (especially of rye). although the fungus reduces the yield of cereals, the effects of the ergot's alkaloid toxins on humans and animals are of much greater significance. in animals, the disease is referred to as ergotism. the most common signs and symptoms are convulsions, hallucination, gangrene, and loss of milk in cattle. the active ingredient of ergot is lysergic acid, which is a precursor of the drug lsd. smuts, rusts, and powdery or downy mildew are other examples of common fungal pathogens that affect crops. aflatoxins are toxic, carcinogenic compounds released by fungi of the genus aspergillus. periodically, harvests of nuts and grains are tainted by aflatoxins, leading to massive recall of produce. this sometimes ruins producers and causes food shortages in developing countries. fungi can affect animals, including humans, in several ways. a mycosis is a fungal disease that results from infection and direct damage. fungi attack animals directly by colonizing and destroying tissues. mycotoxicosis is the poisoning of humans (and other animals) by foods contaminated by fungal toxins (mycotoxins). mycetismus describes the ingestion of preformed toxins in poisonous mushrooms. in addition, individuals who display hypersensitivity to molds and spores develop strong and dangerous allergic reactions. fungal infections are generally very difficult to treat because, unlike bacteria, fungi are eukaryotes. antibiotics only target prokaryotic cells, whereas compounds that kill fungi also harm the eukaryotic animal host. many fungal infections are superficial; that is, they occur on the animals skin. termed cutaneous (skin) mycoses, they can have devastating effects. for example, the decline of the worlds frog population in recent years may be caused by the chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which infects the skin of frogs and presumably interferes with gaseous exchange. similarly, more than a million bats in the united states have been killed by white-nose syndrome, which appears as a white ring around the mouth of the bat. it is caused by the cold-loving fungus pseudogymnoascus destructans, which disseminates its deadly spores in caves where bats hibernate. mycologists are researching the transmission, mechanism, and control of p. destructans to stop its spread. fungi that cause the superficial mycoses of the epidermis, hair, and nails rarely spread to the underlying tissue ([link]). these fungi are often misnamed dermatophytes, from the greek words dermis meaning skin and phyte meaning plant, although they are not plants. dermatophytes are also called ringworms because of the red ring they cause on skin. they secrete extracellular enzymes that break down keratin (a protein found in hair, skin, and nails), causing conditions such as athletes foot and jock itch. these conditions are usually treated with over-the-counter topical creams and powders, and are easily cleared. more persistent superficial mycoses may require prescription oral medications. systemic mycoses spread to internal organs, most commonly entering the body through the respiratory system. for example, coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) is commonly found in the southwestern united states, where the fungus resides in the dust. once inhaled, the spores develop in the lungs and cause symptoms similar to those of tuberculosis. histoplasmosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus histoplasma capsulatum. it also causes pulmonary infections, and in rarer cases, swelling of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord. treatment of these and many other fungal diseases requires the use of antifungal medications that have serious side effects. opportunistic mycoses are fungal infections that are either common in all environments, or part of the normal biota. they mainly affect individuals who have a compromised immune system. patients in the late stages of aids suffer from opportunistic mycoses that can be life threatening. the yeast candida sp., a common member of the natural biota, can grow unchecked and infect the vagina or mouth (oral thrush) if the ph of the surrounding environment, the persons immune defenses, or the normal population of bacteria are altered. mycetismus can occur when poisonous mushrooms are eaten. it causes a number of human fatalities during mushroom-picking season. many edible fruiting bodies of fungi resemble highly poisonous relatives, and amateur mushroom hunters are cautioned to carefully inspect their harvest and avoid eating mushrooms of doubtful origin. the adage there are bold mushroom pickers and old mushroom pickers, but are there no old, bold mushroom pickers is unfortunately true. dutch elm disease question: do trees resistant to dutch elm disease secrete antifungal compounds? hypothesis: construct a hypothesis that addresses this question. background: dutch elm disease is a fungal infestation that affects many species of elm (ulmus) in north america. the fungus infects the vascular system of the tree, which blocks water flow within the plant and mimics drought stress. accidently introduced to the united states in the early 1930s, it decimated shade trees across the continent. it is caused by the fungus ophiostoma ulmi. the elm bark beetle acts as a vector and transmits the disease from tree to tree. many european and asiatic elms are less susceptible to the disease than are american elms. test the hypothesis: a researcher testing this hypothesis might do the following. inoculate several petri plates containing a medium that supports the growth of fungi with fragments of ophiostoma mycelium. cut (with a metal punch) several disks from the vascular tissue of susceptible varieties of american elms and resistant european and asiatic elms. include control petri plates inoculated with mycelia without plant tissue to verify that the medium and incubation conditions do not interfere with fungal growth. as a positive control, add paper disks impregnated with a known fungicide to petri plates inoculated with the mycelium. incubate the plates for a set number of days to allow fungal growth and spreading of the mycelium over the surface of the plate. record the diameter of the zone of clearing, if any, around the tissue samples and the fungicide control disk. record your observations in the following table. analyze the data and report the results. compare the effect of distilled water to the fungicide. these are negative and positive controls that validate the experimental set up. the fungicide should be surrounded by a clear zone where the fungus growth was inhibited. is there a difference among different species of elm? draw a conclusion: was there antifungal activity as expected from the fungicide? did the results support the hypothesis? if not, how can this be explained? there are several possible explanations for resistance to a pathogen. active deterrence of infection is only one of them. fungi establish parasitic relationships with plants and animals. fungal diseases can decimate crops and spoil food during storage. compounds produced by fungi can be toxic to humans and other animals. mycoses are infections caused by fungi. superficial mycoses affect the skin, whereas systemic mycoses spread through the body. fungal infections are difficult to cure.","[('mycosi', 'mycoses', 'mycosis'), ('antifungal', 'antifungals'), ('plant parasite', 'plant parasites'), ('animal parasite', 'animal parasites'),

124,stax-bio,24,Fungi,5,m44629,Importance of Fungi in Human Life,"although we often think of fungi as organisms that cause disease and rot food, fungi are important to human life on many levels. as we have seen, they influence the well-being of human populations on a large scale because they are part of the nutrient cycle in ecosystems. they have other ecosystem roles as well. as animal pathogens, fungi help to control the population of damaging pests. these fungi are very specific to the insects they attack, and do not infect animals or plants. fungi are currently under investigation as potential microbial insecticides, with several already on the market. for example, the fungus beauveria bassiana is a pesticide being tested as a possible biological control agent for the recent spread of emerald ash borer. it has been released in michigan, illinois, indiana, ohio, west virginia and maryland ([link]). the mycorrhizal relationship between fungi and plant roots is essential for the productivity of farm land. without the fungal partner in root systems, 8090 percent of trees and grasses would not survive. mycorrhizal fungal inoculants are available as soil amendments from gardening supply stores and are promoted by supporters of organic agriculture. we also eat some types of fungi. mushrooms figure prominently in the human diet. morels, shiitake mushrooms, chanterelles, and truffles are considered delicacies ([link]). the humble meadow mushroom, agaricus campestris, appears in many dishes. molds of the genus penicillium ripen many cheeses. they originate in the natural environment such as the caves of roquefort, france, where wheels of sheep milk cheese are stacked in order to capture the molds responsible for the blue veins and pungent taste of the cheese. fermentationof grains to produce beer, and of fruits to produce wineis an ancient art that humans in most cultures have practiced for millennia. wild yeasts are acquired from the environment and used to ferment sugars into co2 and ethyl alcohol under anaerobic conditions. it is now possible to purchase isolated strains of wild yeasts from different wine-making regions. louis pasteur was instrumental in developing a reliable strain of brewers yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, for the french brewing industry in the late 1850s. this was one of the first examples of biotechnology patenting. many secondary metabolites of fungi are of great commercial importance. antibiotics are naturally produced by fungi to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, limiting their competition in the natural environment. important antibiotics, such as penicillin and the cephalosporins, are isolated from fungi. valuable drugs isolated from fungi include the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine (which reduces the risk of rejection after organ transplant), the precursors of steroid hormones, and ergot alkaloids used to stop bleeding. psilocybin is a compound found in fungi such as psilocybe semilanceata and gymnopilus junonius, which have been used for their hallucinogenic properties by various cultures for thousands of years. as simple eukaryotic organisms, fungi are important model research organisms. many advances in modern genetics were achieved by the use of the red bread mold neurospora crassa. additionally, many important genes originally discovered in s. cerevisiae served as a starting point in discovering analogous human genes. as a eukaryotic organism, the yeast cell produces and modifies proteins in a manner similar to human cells, as opposed to the bacterium escherichia coli, which lacks the internal membrane structures and enzymes to tag proteins for export. this makes yeast a much better organism for use in recombinant dna technology experiments. like bacteria, yeasts grow easily in culture, have a short generation time, and are amenable to genetic modification. fungi are important to everyday human life. fungi are important decomposers in most ecosystems. mycorrhizal fungi are essential for the growth of most plants. fungi, as food, play a role in human nutrition in the form of mushrooms, and also as agents of fermentation in the production of bread, cheeses, alcoholic beverages, and numerous other food preparations. secondary metabolites of fungi are used as medicines, such as antibiotics and anticoagulants. fungi are model organisms for the study of eukaryotic genetics and metabolism.","[('fungi beverage', 'fungi beverages'), ('food fungi', 'food fungis'), ('industrial fungi', 'industrial fungis'), ('fungi', 'fungis'), ('fungu', 'fungi', 'fungus'), ('model organism', 'model organisms')]"
125,stax-bio,25,Seedless Plants,0,m44633,Introduction,"an incredible variety of seedless plants populates the terrestrial landscape. mosses may grow on a tree trunk, and horsetails may display their jointed stems and spindly leaves across the forest floor. today, seedless plants represent only a small fraction of the plants in our environment; yet, three hundred million years ago, seedless plants dominated the landscape and grew in the enormous swampy forests of the carboniferous period. their decomposition created large deposits of coal that we mine today. current evolutionary thought holds that all plantsgreen algae as well as land dwellersare monophyletic; that is, they are descendants of a single common ancestor. the evolutionary transition from water to land imposed severe constraints on plants. they had to develop strategies to avoid drying out, to disperse reproductive cells in air, for structural support, and for capturing and filtering sunlight. while seed plants developed adaptations that allowed them to populate even the most arid habitats on earth, full independence from water did not happen in all plants. most seedless plants still require a moist environment.","[('setum', 'setas', 'seta'), ('landscape designer', 'landscape designers'), ('plant life on land', 'plant life on lands', 'plant lives on land', 'plant lives on lands', 'plants life on land', 'plants life on lands', 'plants lives on land', 'plants lives on lands'), ('vein', 'veins'), ('root', 'roots'), ('haplodiplodontic', 'haplodiplodontics'), ('leaf', 'leavess', 'leaves'), ('haplontic', 'haplontics'), ('capsule', 'capsules'), ('plant phylogeny', 'plant phylogenies'), ('seedless tracheophyte', 'seedless tracheophytes'), ('microspore', 'microspores'), ('sporopollenin', 'sporopollenins'), ('seedless vascular plant', 'seedless vascular plants'), ('non-vascular plant', 'non-vascular plants'), ('mos', 'mosses', 'moss'), ('plant ecology', 'plant ecologies'), ('club mos', 'club mosses', 'club moss'), ('lignin', 'lignins'), ('plant', 'plantss', 'plants'), ('phloem', 'phloems'), ('sporocyte', 'sporocytes'), ('fern', 'ferns'), ('horsetail', 'horsetails'), ('extant', 'extants'), ('early plant life', 'early plant lives', 'early plants life', 'early plants lives'), ('homosporou', 'homosporouss', 'homosporous'), ('plant adaptation', 'plant adaptations'), ('charophyte', 'charophytes'), ('protonema', 'protonemas'), ('seedless plant', 'seedless plants'), ('land plant adaptation', 'land plant adaptationss', 'land plant adaptations', 'land plants adaptation', 'land plants adaptationss', 'land plants adaptations', 'lands plant adaptation', 'lands plant adaptationss', 'lands plant adaptations', 'lands plants adaptation', 'lands plants adaptationss', 'lands plants adaptations'), ('lycophytum', 'lycophytas', 'lycophyta'), ('rhizoid', 'rhizoids'), ('division of land plant', 'division of land plants', 'division of land plants', 'division of lands plant', 'division of lands plants', 'division of lands plants', 'divisions of land plant', 'divisions of land plants', 'divisions of land plants', 'divisions of lands plant', 'divisions of lands plants', 'divisions of lands plants'), ('archegonium', 'archegoniums'), ('alternation of generation', 'alternation of generations', 'alternation of generations', 'alternations of generation', 'alternations of generations', 'alternations of generations'), ('vascular plant', 'vascular plants'), ('sporophyll', 'sporophylls'), ('ecosystem', 'ecosystems'), ('seedless non-vascular plant', 'seedless non-vascular plants'), ('charale', 'charaless', 'charales'), ('peristome', 'peristomes'), ('xylem', 'xylems'), ('bryophyte lifecycle', 'bryophyte lifecycles'), ('plant evolution', 'plant evolutions'), ('green alga reproduction', 'green alga reproductions', 'green algae reproduction', 'green algae reproductions'), ('peat mos', 'peat mosses', 'peat moss'), ('green alga', 'green algaes', 'green algae'), ('diplontic', 'diplontics'), ('land adaptation', 'land adaptations'), ('apical meristem', 'apical meristems'), ('hornwort', 'hornworts'), ('sporangium', 'sporangias', 'sporangia'), ('extinct plant', 'extinct plants'), ('megaspore', 'megaspores'), ('extinct', 'extincts'), ('streptophyte', 'streptophytes'), ('gametangium', 'gametangiums'), ('heterosporou', 'heterosporouss', 'heterosporous'), ('antheridium', 'antheridiums'), ('vascular tissue', 'vascular tissues'), ('gemma', 'gemmas'), ('fern lifecycle', 'fern lifecycles'), ('tracheophyte', 'tracheophytes'), ('bryophyte', 'bryophytes'), ('whisk fern', 'whisk ferns'), ('paleobotany', 'paleobotanies'), ('evolution of land plant', 'evolution of land plants', 'evolution of land plants', 'evolution of lands plant', 'evolution of lands plants', 'evolution of lands plants', 'evolutions of land plant', 'evolutions of land plants', 'evolutions of land plants', 'evolutions of lands plant', 'evolutions of lands plants', 'evolutions of lands plants'), ('liverwort', 'liverworts'), ('strobili', 'strobilis'), ('embryophyte', 'embryophytes'), ('megaphyll', 'megaphylls'), ('microphyll', 'microphylls')]"
126,stax-bio,25,Seedless Plants,1,m44635,Early Plant Life,"the kingdom plantae constitutes large and varied groups of organisms. there are more than 300,000 species of catalogued plants. of these, more than 260,000 are seed plants. mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering plants are all members of the plant kingdom. most biologists also consider green algae to be plants, although others exclude all algae from the plant kingdom. the reason for this disagreement stems from the fact that only green algae, the charophytes, share common characteristics with land plants (such as using chlorophyll a and b plus carotene in the same proportion as plants). these characteristics are absent in other types of algae. algae and evolutionary paths to photosynthesissome scientists consider all algae to be plants, while others assert that only the charophytes belong in the kingdom plantae. these divergent opinions are related to the different evolutionary paths to photosynthesis selected for in different types of algae. while all algae are photosyntheticthat is, they contain some form of a chloroplastthey didnt all become photosynthetic via the same path. the ancestors to the green algae became photosynthetic by endosymbiosing a green, photosynthetic bacterium about 1.65 billion years ago. that algal line evolved into the charophytes, and eventually into the modern mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. their evolutionary trajectory was relatively straight and monophyletic. in contrast, the other algaered, brown, golden, stramenopiles, and so onall became photosynthetic by secondary, or even tertiary, endosymbiotic events; that is, they endosymbiosed cells that had already endosymbiosed a cyanobacterium. these latecomers to photosynthesis are parallels to the charophytes in terms of autotrophy, but they did not expand to the same extent as the charophytes, nor did they colonize the land. the different views on whether all algae are plantae arise from how these evolutionary paths are viewed. scientists who solely track evolutionary straight lines (that is, monophyly), consider only the charophytes as plants. to biologists who cast a broad net over living things that share a common characteristic (in this case, photosynthetic eukaryotes), all algae are plants. as organisms adapted to life on land, they had to contend with several challenges in the terrestrial environment. water has been described as the stuff of life. the cells interior is a watery soup: in this medium, most small molecules dissolve and diffuse, and the majority of the chemical reactions of metabolism take place. desiccation, or drying out, is a constant danger for an organism exposed to air. even when parts of a plant are close to a source of water, the aerial structures are likely to dry out. water also provides buoyancy to organisms. on land, plants need to develop structural support in a medium that does not give the same lift as water. the organism is also subject to bombardment by mutagenic radiation, because air does not filter out ultraviolet rays of sunlight. additionally, the male gametes must reach the female gametes using new strategies, because swimming is no longer possible. therefore, both gametes and zygotes must be protected from desiccation. the successful land plants developed strategies to deal with all of these challenges. not all adaptations appeared at once. some species never moved very far from the aquatic environment, whereas others went on to conquer the driest environments on earth. to balance these survival challenges, life on land offers several advantages. first, sunlight is abundant. water acts as a filter, altering the spectral quality of light absorbed by the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll. second, carbon dioxide is more readily available in air than in water, since it diffuses faster in air. third, land plants evolved before land animals; therefore, until dry land was colonized by animals, no predators threatened plant life. this situation changed as animals emerged from the water and fed on the abundant sources of nutrients in the established flora. in turn, plants developed strategies to deter predation: from spines and thorns to toxic chemicals. early land plants, like the early land animals, did not live very far from an abundant source of water and developed survival strategies to combat dryness. one of these strategies is called tolerance. many mosses, for example, can dry out to a brown and brittle mat, but as soon as rain or a flood makes water available, mosses will absorb it and are restored to their healthy green appearance. another strategy is to colonize environments with high humidity, where droughts are uncommon. ferns, which are considered an early lineage of plants, thrive in damp and cool places such as the understory of temperate forests. later, plants moved away from moist or aquatic environments using resistance to desiccation, rather than tolerance. these plants, like cacti, minimize the loss of water to such an extent they can survive in extremely dry environments. the most successful adaptation solution was the development of new structures that gave plants the advantage when colonizing new and dry environments. four major adaptations are found in all terrestrial plants: the alternation of generations, a sporangium in which the spores are formed, a gametangium that produces haploid cells, and apical meristem tissue in roots and shoots. the evolution of a waxy cuticle and a cell wall with lignin also contributed to the success of land plants. these adaptations are noticeably lacking in the closely related green algaeanother reason for the debate over their placement in the plant kingdom. alternation of generations describes a life cycle in which an organism has both haploid and diploid multicellular stages ([link]). haplontic refers to a lifecycle in which there is a dominant haploid stage, and diplontic refers to a lifecycle in which the diploid is the dominant life stage. humans are diplontic. most plants exhibit alternation of generations, which is described as haplodiplodontic: the haploid multicellular form, known as a gametophyte, is followed in the development sequence by a multicellular diploid organism: the sporophyte. the gametophyte gives rise to the gametes (reproductive cells) by mitosis. this can be the most obvious phase of the life cycle of the plant, as in the mosses, or it can occur in a microscopic structure, such as a pollen grain, in the higher plants (a common collective term for the vascular plants). the sporophyte stage is barely noticeable in lower plants (the collective term for the plant groups of mosses, liverworts, and lichens). towering trees are the diplontic phase in the lifecycles of plants such as sequoias and pines. protection of the embryo is a major requirement for land plants. the vulnerable embryo must be sheltered from desiccation and other environmental hazards. in both seedless and seed plants, the female gametophyte provides protection and nutrients to the embryo as it develops into the new generation of sporophyte. this distinguishing feature of land plants gave the group its alternate name of embryophytes. the sporophyte of seedless plants is diploid and results from syngamy (fusion) of two gametes. the sporophyte bears the sporangia (singular, sporangium): organs that first appeared in the land plants. the term sporangia literally means spore in a vessel, as it is a reproductive sac that contains spores [link]. inside the multicellular sporangia, the diploid sporocytes, or mother cells, produce haploid spores by meiosis, where the 2n chromosome number is reduced to 1n (note that many plant sporophytes are polyploid: for example, durum wheat is tetraploid, bread wheat is hexaploid, and some ferns are 1000-ploid). the spores are later released by the sporangia and disperse in the environment. two different types of spores are produced in land plants, resulting in the separation of sexes at different points in the lifecycle. seedless non-vascular plants produce only one kind of spore and are called homosporous. the gametophyte phase is dominant in these plants. after germinating from a spore, the resulting gametophyte produces both male and female gametangia, usually on the same individual. in contrast, heterosporous plants produce two morphologically different types of spores. the male spores are called microspores, because of their smaller size, and develop into the male gametophyte; the comparatively larger megaspores develop into the female gametophyte. heterospory is observed in a few seedless vascular plants and in all seed plants. when the haploid spore germinates in a hospitable environment, it generates a multicellular gametophyte by mitosis. the gametophyte supports the zygote formed from the fusion of gametes and the resulting young sporophyte (vegetative form). the cycle then begins anew. the spores of seedless plants are surrounded by thick cell walls containing a tough polymer known as sporopollenin. this complex substance is characterized by long chains of organic molecules related to fatty acids and carotenoids: hence the yellow color of most pollen. sporopollenin is unusually resistant to chemical and biological degradation. in seed plants, which use pollen to transfer the male sperm to the female egg, the toughness of sporopollenin explains the existence of well-preserved pollen fossils. sporopollenin was once thought to be an innovation of land plants; however, the green algae coleochaetes forms spores that contain sporopollenin. gametangia (singular, gametangium) are structures observed on multicellular haploid gametophytes. in the gametangia, precursor cells give rise to gametes by mitosis. the male gametangium (antheridium) releases sperm. many seedless plants produce sperm equipped with flagella that enable them to swim in a moist environment to the archegonia: the female gametangium. the embryo develops inside the archegonium as the sporophyte. gametangia are prominent in seedless plants, but are very rarely found in seed plants. shoots and roots of plants increase in length through rapid cell division in a tissue called the apical meristem, which is a small zone of cells found at the shoot tip or root tip ([link]). the apical meristem is made of undifferentiated cells that continue to proliferate throughout the life of the plant. meristematic cells give rise to all the specialized tissues of the organism. elongation of the shoots and roots allows a plant to access additional space and resources: light in the case of the shoot, and water and minerals in the case of roots. a separate meristem, called the lateral meristem, produces cells that increase the diameter of tree trunks. as plants adapted to dry land and became independent from the constant presence of water in damp habitats, new organs and structures made their appearance. early land plants did not grow more than a few inches off the ground, competing for light on these low mats. by developing a shoot and growing taller, individual plants captured more light. because air offers substantially less support than water, land plants incorporated more rigid molecules in their stems (and later, tree trunks). in small plants such as single-celled algae, simple diffusion suffices to distribute water and nutrients throughout the organism. however, for plants to evolve larger forms, the evolution of vascular tissue for the distribution of water and solutes was a prerequisite. the vascular system contains xylem and phloem tissues. xylem conducts water and minerals absorbed from the soil up to the shoot, while phloem transports food derived from photosynthesis throughout the entire plant. a root system evolved to take up water and minerals from the soil, and to anchor the increasingly taller shoot in the soil. in land plants, a waxy, waterproof cover called a cuticle protects the leaves and stems from desiccation. however, the cuticle also prevents intake of carbon dioxide needed for the synthesis of carbohydrates through photosynthesis. to overcome this, stomata or pores that open and close to regulate traffic of gases and water vapor appeared in plants as they moved away from moist environments into drier habitats. water filters ultraviolet-b (uvb) light, which is harmful to all organisms, especially those that must absorb light to survive. this filtering does not occur for land plants. this presented an additional challenge to land colonization, which was met by the evolution of biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of protective flavonoids and other compounds: pigments that absorb uv wavelengths of light and protect the aerial parts of plants from photodynamic damage. plants cannot avoid being eaten by animals. instead, they synthesize a large range of poisonous secondary metabolites: complex organic molecules such as alkaloids, whose noxious smells and unpleasant taste deter animals. these toxic compounds can also cause severe diseases and even death, thus discouraging predation. humans have used many of these compounds for centuries as drugs, medications, or spices. in contrast, as plants co-evolved with animals, the development of sweet and nutritious metabolites lured animals into providing valuable assistance in dispersing pollen grains, fruit, or seeds. plants have been enlisting animals to be their helpers in this way for hundreds of millions of years. no discussion of the evolution of plants on land can be undertaken without a brief review of the timeline of the geological eras. the early era, known as the paleozoic, is divided into six periods. it starts with the cambrian period, followed by the ordovician, silurian, devonian, carboniferous, and permian. the major event to mark the ordovician, more than 500 million years ago, was the colonization of land by the ancestors of modern land plants. fossilized cells, cuticles, and spores of early land plants have been dated as far back as the ordovician period in the early paleozoic era. the oldest-known vascular plants have been identified in deposits from the devonian. one of the richest sources of information is the rhynie chert, a sedimentary rock deposit found in rhynie, scotland ([link]), where embedded fossils of some of the earliest vascular plants have been identified. paleobotanists distinguish between extinct species, as fossils, and extant species, which are still living. the extinct vascular plants, classified as zosterophylls and trimerophytes, most probably lacked true leaves and roots and formed low vegetation mats similar in size to modern-day mosses, although some trimetophytes could reach one meter in height. the later genus cooksonia, which flourished during the silurian, has been extensively studied from well-preserved examples. imprints of cooksonia show slender branching stems ending in what appear to be sporangia. from the recovered specimens, it is not possible to establish for certain whether cooksonia possessed vascular tissues. fossils indicate that by the end of the devonian period, ferns, horsetails, and seed plants populated the landscape, giving rising to trees and forests. this luxuriant vegetation helped enrich the atmosphere in oxygen, making it easier for air-breathing animals to colonize dry land. plants also established early symbiotic relationships with fungi, creating mycorrhizae: a relationship in which the fungal network of filaments increases the efficiency of the plant root system, and the plants provide the fungi with byproducts of photosynthesis. paleobotanisthow organisms acquired traits that allow them to colonize new environmentsand how the contemporary ecosystem is shapedare fundamental questions of evolution. paleobotany (the study of extinct plants) addresses these questions through the analysis of fossilized specimens retrieved from field studies, reconstituting the morphology of organisms that disappeared long ago. paleobotanists trace the evolution of plants by following the modifications in plant morphology: shedding light on the connection between existing plants by identifying common ancestors that display the same traits. this field seeks to find transitional species that bridge gaps in the path to the development of modern organisms. fossils are formed when organisms are trapped in sediments or environments where their shapes are preserved. paleobotanists collect fossil specimens in the field and place them in the context of the geological sediments and other fossilized organisms surrounding them. the activity requires great care to preserve the integrity of the delicate fossils and the layers of rock in which they are found. one of the most exciting recent developments in paleobotany is the use of analytical chemistry and molecular biology to study fossils. preservation of molecular structures requires an environment free of oxygen, since oxidation and degradation of material through the activity of microorganisms depend on its presence. one example of the use of analytical chemistry and molecular biology is the identification of oleanane, a compound that deters pests. up to this point, oleanane appeared to be unique to flowering plants; however, it has now been recovered from sediments dating from the permian, much earlier than the current dates given for the appearance of the first flowering plants. paleobotanists can also study fossil dna, which can yield a large amount of information, by analyzing and comparing the dna sequences of extinct plants with those of living and related organisms. through this analysis, evolutionary relationships can be built for plant lineages. some paleobotanists are skeptical of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of molecular fossils. for example, the chemical materials of interest degrade rapidly when exposed to air during their initial isolation, as well as in further manipulations. there is always a high risk of contaminating the specimens with extraneous material, mostly from microorganisms. nevertheless, as technology is refined, the analysis of dna from fossilized plants will provide invaluable information on the evolution of plants and their adaptation to an ever-changing environment. the green algae and land plants are grouped together into a subphylum called the streptophytina, and thus are called streptophytes. in a further division, land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue, as detailed in [link]. plants that lack vascular tissue, which is formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients, are referred to as non-vascular plants. liverworts, mosses, and hornworts are seedless, non-vascular plants that likely appeared early in land plant evolution. vascular plants developed a network of cells that conduct water and solutes. the first vascular plants appeared in the late ordovician and were probably similar to lycophytes, which include club mosses (not to be confused with the mosses) and the pterophytes (ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns). lycophytes and pterophytes are referred to as seedless vascular plants, because they do not produce seeds. the seed plants, or spermatophytes, form the largest group of all existing plants, and hence dominate the landscape. seed plants include gymnosperms, most notably conifers (gymnosperms), which produce naked seeds, and the most successful of all plants, the flowering plants (angiosperms). angiosperms protect their seeds inside chambers at the center of a flower; the walls of the chamber later develop into a fruit. land plants acquired traits that made it possible to colonize land and survive out of the water. all land plants share the following characteristics: alternation of generations, with the haploid plant called a gametophyte, and the diploid plant called a sporophyte; protection of the embryo, formation of haploid spores in a sporangium, formation of gametes in a gametangium, and an apical meristem. vascular tissues, roots, leaves, cuticle cover, and a tough outer layer that protects the spores contributed to the adaptation of plants to dry land. land plants appeared about 500 million years ago in the ordovician period.","[('plant life on land', 'plant life on lands', 'plant lives on land', 'plant lives on

127,stax-bio,25,Seedless Plants,2,m44637,Green Algae: Precursors of Land Plants,"until recently, all photosynthetic eukaryotes were considered members of the kingdom plantae. the brown, red, and gold algae, however, have been reassigned to the protista kingdom. this is because apart from their ability to capture light energy and fix co2, they lack many structural and biochemical traits that distinguish plants from protists. the position of green algae is more ambiguous. green algae contain the same carotenoids and chlorophyll a and b as land plants, whereas other algae have different accessory pigments and types of chlorophyll molecules in addition to chlorophyll a. both green algae and land plants also store carbohydrates as starch. cells in green algae divide along cell plates called phragmoplasts, and their cell walls are layered in the same manner as the cell walls of embryophytes. consequently, land plants and closely related green algae are now part of a new monophyletic group called streptophyta. the remaining green algae, which belong to a group called chlorophyta, include more than 7000 different species that live in fresh or brackish water, in seawater, or in snow patches. a few green algae even survive on soil, provided it is covered by a thin film of moisture in which they can live. periodic dry spells provide a selective advantage to algae that can survive water stress. some green algae may already be familiar, in particular spirogyra and desmids. their cells contain chloroplasts that display a dizzying variety of shapes, and their cell walls contain cellulose, as do land plants. some green algae are single cells, such as chlorella and chlamydomonas, which adds to the ambiguity of green algae classification, because plants are multicellular. other algae, like ulva (commonly called sea lettuce), form colonies ([link]). green algae reproduce both asexually, by fragmentation or dispersal of spores, or sexually, by producing gametes that fuse during fertilization. in a single-celled organism such as chlamydomonas, there is no mitosis after fertilization. in the multicellular ulva, a sporophyte grows by mitosis after fertilization. both chlamydomonas and ulva produce flagellated gametes. green algae in the order charales, and the coleochaetes (microscopic green algae that enclose their spores in sporopollenin), are considered the closest living relatives of embryophytes. the charales can be traced back 420 million years. they live in a range of fresh water habitats and vary in size from a few millimeters to a meter in length. the representative species is chara ([link]), often called muskgrass or skunkweed because of its unpleasant smell. large cells form the thallus: the main stem of the alga. branches arising from the nodes are made of smaller cells. male and female reproductive structures are found on the nodes, and the sperm have flagella. unlike land plants, charales do not undergo alternation of generations in their lifecycle. charales exhibit a number of traits that are significant in their adaptation to land life. they produce the compounds lignin and sporopollenin, and form plasmodesmata that connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. the egg, and later, the zygote, form in a protected chamber on the parent plant. new information from recent, extensive dna sequence analysis of green algae indicates that the zygnematales are more closely related to the embryophytes than the charales. the zygnematales include the familiar genus spirogyra. as techniques in dna analysis improve and new information on comparative genomics arises, the phylogenetic connections between species will change. clearly, plant biologists have not yet solved the mystery of the origin of land plants. green algae share more traits with land plants than other algae, according to structure and dna analysis. charales form sporopollenin and precursors of lignin, phragmoplasts, and have flagellated sperm. they do not exhibit alternation of generations.","[('charale', 'charaless', 'charales'), ('seedless plant', 'seedless plantss', 'seedless plants'), ('streptophyte', 'streptophytes'), ('green alga reproduction', 'green alga reproductions', 'green algae reproduction', 'green algae reproductions'), ('plant phylogeny', 'plant phylogenies'), ('plant', 'plantss', 'plants'), ('green alga', 'green algaes', 'green algae')]"
128,stax-bio,25,Seedless Plants,3,m44638,Bryophytes,"bryophytes are the group of plants that are the closest extant relative of early terrestrial plants. the first bryophytes (liverworts) most likely appeared in the ordovician period, about 450 million years ago. because of the lack of lignin and other resistant structures, the likelihood of bryophytes forming fossils is rather small. some spores protected by sporopollenin have survived and are attributed to early bryophytes. by the silurian period, however, vascular plants had spread through the continents. this compelling fact is used as evidence that non-vascular plants must have preceded the silurian period. more than 25,000 species of bryophytes thrive in mostly damp habitats, although some live in deserts. they constitute the major flora of inhospitable environments like the tundra, where their small size and tolerance to desiccation offer distinct advantages. they generally lack lignin and do not have actual tracheids (xylem cells specialized for water conduction). rather, water and nutrients circulate inside specialized conducting cells. although the term non-tracheophyte is more accurate, bryophytes are commonly called nonvascular plants. in a bryophyte, all the conspicuous vegetative organsincluding the photosynthetic leaf-like structures, the thallus, stem, and the rhizoid that anchors the plant to its substratebelong to the haploid organism or gametophyte. the sporophyte is barely noticeable. the gametes formed by bryophytes swim with a flagellum, as do gametes in a few of the tracheophytes. the sporangiumthe multicellular sexual reproductive structureis present in bryophytes and absent in the majority of algae. the bryophyte embryo also remains attached to the parent plant, which protects and nourishes it. this is a characteristic of land plants. the bryophytes are divided into three phyla: the liverworts or hepaticophyta, the hornworts or anthocerotophyta, and the mosses or true bryophyta. liverworts (hepaticophyta) are viewed as the plants most closely related to the ancestor that moved to land. liverworts have colonized every terrestrial habitat on earth and diversified to more than 7000 existing species ([link]). some gametophytes form lobate green structures, as seen in [link]. the shape is similar to the lobes of the liver, and hence provides the origin of the name given to the phylum. openings that allow the movement of gases may be observed in liverworts. however, these are not stomata, because they do not actively open and close. the plant takes up water over its entire surface and has no cuticle to prevent desiccation. [link] represents the lifecycle of a liverwort. the cycle starts with the release of haploid spores from the sporangium that developed on the sporophyte. spores disseminated by wind or water germinate into flattened thalli attached to the substrate by thin, single-celled filaments. male and female gametangia develop on separate, individual plants. once released, male gametes swim with the aid of their flagella to the female gametangium (the archegonium), and fertilization ensues. the zygote grows into a small sporophyte still attached to the parent gametophyte. it will give rise, by meiosis, to the next generation of spores. liverwort plants can also reproduce asexually, by the breaking of branches or the spreading of leaf fragments called gemmae. in this latter type of reproduction, the gemmaesmall, intact, complete pieces of plant that are produced in a cup on the surface of the thallus (shown in [link])are splashed out of the cup by raindrops. the gemmae then land nearby and develop into gametophytes. the hornworts (anthocerotophyta) belong to the broad bryophyte group. they have colonized a variety of habitats on land, although they are never far from a source of moisture. the short, blue-green gametophyte is the dominant phase of the lifecycle of a hornwort. the narrow, pipe-like sporophyte is the defining characteristic of the group. the sporophytes emerge from the parent gametophyte and continue to grow throughout the life of the plant ([link]). stomata appear in the hornworts and are abundant on the sporophyte. photosynthetic cells in the thallus contain a single chloroplast. meristem cells at the base of the plant keep dividing and adding to its height. many hornworts establish symbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria that fix nitrogen from the environment. the lifecycle of hornworts ([link]) follows the general pattern of alternation of generations. the gametophytes grow as flat thalli on the soil with embedded gametangia. flagellated sperm swim to the archegonia and fertilize eggs. the zygote develops into a long and slender sporophyte that eventually splits open, releasing spores. thin cells called pseudoelaters surround the spores and help propel them further in the environment. unlike the elaters observed in horsetails, the hornwort pseudoelaters are single-celled structures. the haploid spores germinate and give rise to the next generation of gametophyte. more than 10,000 species of mosses have been catalogued. their habitats vary from the tundra, where they are the main vegetation, to the understory of tropical forests. in the tundra, the mosses shallow rhizoids allow them to fasten to a substrate without penetrating the frozen soil. mosses slow down erosion, store moisture and soil nutrients, and provide shelter for small animals as well as food for larger herbivores, such as the musk ox. mosses are very sensitive to air pollution and are used to monitor air quality. they are also sensitive to copper salts, so these salts are a common ingredient of compounds marketed to eliminate mosses from lawns. mosses form diminutive gametophytes, which are the dominant phase of the lifecycle. green, flat structuresresembling true leaves, but lacking vascular tissueare attached in a spiral to a central stalk. the plants absorb water and nutrients directly through these leaf-like structures. some mosses have small branches. some primitive traits of green algae, such as flagellated sperm, are still present in mosses that are dependent on water for reproduction. other features of mosses are clearly adaptations to dry land. for example, stomata are present on the stems of the sporophyte, and a primitive vascular system runs up the sporophytes stalk. additionally, mosses are anchored to the substratewhether it is soil, rock, or roof tilesby multicellular rhizoids. these structures are precursors of roots. they originate from the base of the gametophyte, but are not the major route for the absorption of water and minerals. the lack of a true root system explains why it is so easy to rip moss mats from a tree trunk. the moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in [link]. the most familiar structure is the haploid gametophyte, which germinates from a haploid spore and forms first a protonemausually, a tangle of single-celled filaments that hug the ground. cells akin to an apical meristem actively divide and give rise to a gametophore, consisting of a photosynthetic stem and foliage-like structures. rhizoids form at the base of the gametophore. gametangia of both sexes develop on separate gametophores. the male organ (the antheridium) produces many sperm, whereas the archegonium (the female organ) forms a single egg. at fertilization, the sperm swims down the neck to the venter and unites with the egg inside the archegonium. the zygote, protected by the archegonium, divides and grows into a sporophyte, still attached by its foot to the gametophyte. the slender seta (plural, setae), as seen in [link], contains tubular cells that transfer nutrients from the base of the sporophyte (the foot) to the sporangium or capsule. a structure called a peristome increases the spread of spores after the tip of the capsule falls off at dispersal. the concentric tissue around the mouth of the capsule is made of triangular, close-fitting units, a little like teeth; these open and close depending on moisture levels, and periodically release spores. seedless nonvascular plants are small, having the gametophyte as the dominant stage of the lifecycle. without a vascular system and roots, they absorb water and nutrients on all their exposed surfaces. collectively known as bryophytes, the three main groups include the liverworts, the hornworts, and the mosses. liverworts are the most primitive plants and are closely related to the first land plants. hornworts developed stomata and possess a single chloroplast per cell. mosses have simple conductive cells and are attached to the substrate by rhizoids. they colonize harsh habitats and can regain moisture after drying out. the moss sporangium is a complex structure that allows release of spores away from the parent plant.","[('setum', 'setas', 'seta'), ('peristome', 'peristomes'), ('seedless plant', 'seedless plantss', 'seedless plants'), ('protonema', 'protonemas'),

129,stax-bio,25,Seedless Plants,4,m44640,Seedless Vascular Plants,"the vascular plants, or tracheophytes, are the dominant and most conspicuous group of land plants. more than 260,000 species of tracheophytes represent more than 90 percent of earths vegetation. several evolutionary innovations explain their success and their ability to spread to all habitats. bryophytes may have been successful at the transition from an aquatic habitat to land, but they are still dependent on water for reproduction, and absorb moisture and nutrients through the gametophyte surface. the lack of roots for absorbing water and minerals from the soil, as well as a lack of reinforced conducting cells, limits bryophytes to small sizes. although they may survive in reasonably dry conditions, they cannot reproduce and expand their habitat range in the absence of water. vascular plants, on the other hand, can achieve enormous heights, thus competing successfully for light. photosynthetic organs become leaves, and pipe-like cells or vascular tissues transport water, minerals, and fixed carbon throughout the organism. in seedless vascular plants, the diploid sporophyte is the dominant phase of the lifecycle. the gametophyte is now an inconspicuous, but still independent, organism. throughout plant evolution, there is an evident reversal of roles in the dominant phase of the lifecycle. seedless vascular plants still depend on water during fertilization, as the sperm must swim on a layer of moisture to reach the egg. this step in reproduction explains why ferns and their relatives are more abundant in damp environments. the first fossils that show the presence of vascular tissue date to the silurian period, about 430million years ago. the simplest arrangement of conductive cells shows a pattern of xylem at the center surrounded by phloem. xylem is the tissue responsible for the storage and long-distance transport of water and nutrients, as well as the transfer of water-soluble growth factors from the organs of synthesis to the target organs. the tissue consists of conducting cells, known as tracheids, and supportive filler tissue, called parenchyma. xylem conductive cells incorporate the compound lignin into their walls, and are thus described as lignified. lignin itself is a complex polymer that is impermeable to water and confers mechanical strength to vascular tissue. with their rigid cell walls, the xylem cells provide support to the plant and allow it to achieve impressive heights. tall plants have a selective advantage by being able to reach unfiltered sunlight and disperse their spores or seeds further away, thus expanding their range. by growing higher than other plants, tall trees cast their shadow on shorter plants and limit competition for water and precious nutrients in the soil. phloem is the second type of vascular tissue; it transports sugars, proteins, and other solutes throughout the plant. phloem cells are divided into sieve elements (conducting cells) and cells that support the sieve elements. together, xylem and phloem tissues form the vascular system of plants. roots are not well preserved in the fossil record. nevertheless, it seems that roots appeared later in evolution than vascular tissue. the development of an extensive network of roots represented a significant new feature of vascular plants. thin rhizoids attached bryophytes to the substrate, but these rather flimsy filaments did not provide a strong anchor for the plant; neither did they absorb substantial amounts of water and nutrients. in contrast, roots, with their prominent vascular tissue system, transfer water and minerals from the soil to the rest of the plant. the extensive network of roots that penetrates deep into the soil to reach sources of water also stabilizes trees by acting as a ballast or anchor. the majority of roots establish a symbiotic relationship with fungi, forming mycorrhizae, which benefit the plant by greatly increasing the surface area for absorption of water and soil minerals and nutrients. a third innovation marks the seedless vascular plants. accompanying the prominence of the sporophyte and the development of vascular tissue, the appearance of true leaves improved their photosynthetic efficiency. leaves capture more sunlight with their increased surface area by employing more chloroplasts to trap light energy and convert it to chemical energy, which is then used to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. the carbohydrates are exported to the rest of the plant by the conductive cells of phloem tissue. the existence of two types of morphology suggests that leaves evolved independently in several groups of plants. the first type of leaf is the microphyll, or little leaf, which can be dated to 350million years ago in the late silurian. a microphyll is small and has a simple vascular system. a single unbranched veina bundle of vascular tissue made of xylem and phloemruns through the center of the leaf. microphylls may have originated from the flattening of lateral branches, or from sporangia that lost their reproductive capabilities. microphylls are present in the club mosses and probably preceded the development of megaphylls, or big leaves, which are larger leaves with a pattern of branching veins. megaphylls most likely appeared independently several times during the course of evolution. their complex networks of veins suggest that several branches may have combined into a flattened organ, with the gaps between the branches being filled with photosynthetic tissue. in addition to photosynthesis, leaves play another role in the life of the plants. pine cones, mature fronds of ferns, and flowers are all sporophyllsleaves that were modified structurally to bear sporangia. strobili are cone-like structures that contain sporangia. they are prominent in conifers and are commonly known as pine cones. by the late devonian period, plants had evolved vascular tissue, well-defined leaves, and root systems. with these advantages, plants increased in height and size. during the carboniferous period, swamp forests of club mosses and horsetailssome specimens reaching heights of more than 30 m (100 ft)covered most of the land. these forests gave rise to the extensive coal deposits that gave the carboniferous its name. in seedless vascular plants, the sporophyte became the dominant phase of the lifecycle. water is still required for fertilization of seedless vascular plants, and most favor a moist environment. modern-day seedless tracheophytes include club mosses, horsetails, ferns, and whisk ferns. the club mosses, or phylum lycopodiophyta, are the earliest group of seedless vascular plants. they dominated the landscape of the carboniferous, growing into tall trees and forming large swamp forests. todays club mosses are diminutive, evergreen plants consisting of a stem (which may be branched) and microphylls ([link]). the phylum lycopodiophyta consists of close to 1,200 species, including the quillworts (isoetales), the club mosses (lycopodiales), and spike mosses (selaginellales), none of which are true mosses or bryophytes. lycophytes follow the pattern of alternation of generations seen in the bryophytes, except that the sporophyte is the major stage of the lifecycle. the gametophytes do not depend on the sporophyte for nutrients. some gametophytes develop underground and form mycorrhizal associations with fungi. in club mosses, the sporophyte gives rise to sporophylls arranged in strobili, cone-like structures that give the class its name. lycophytes can be homosporous or heterosporous. horsetails, whisk ferns and ferns belong to the phylum monilophyta, with horsetails placed in the class equisetopsida. the single genus equisetum is the survivor of a large group of plants, known as arthrophyta, which produced large trees and entire swamp forests in the carboniferous. the plants are usually found in damp environments and marshes ([link]). the stem of a horsetail is characterized by the presence of joints or nodes, hence the name arthrophyta (arthro- = ""joint""; -phyta = ""plant""). leaves and branches come out as whorls from the evenly spaced joints. the needle-shaped leaves do not contribute greatly to photosynthesis, the majority of which takes place in the green stem ([link]). silica collects in the epidermal cells, contributing to the stiffness of horsetail plants. underground stems known as rhizomes anchor the plants to the ground. modern-day horsetails are homosporous and produce bisexual gametophytes. while most ferns form large leaves and branching roots, the whisk ferns, class psilotopsida, lack both roots and leaves, probably lost by reduction. photosynthesis takes place in their green stems, and small yellow knobs form at the tip of the branch stem and contain the sporangia. whisk ferns were considered an early pterophytes. however, recent comparative dna analysis suggests that this group may have lost both vascular tissue and roots through evolution, and is more closely related to ferns. with their large fronds, ferns are the most readily recognizable seedless vascular plants. they are considered the most advanced seedless vascular plants and display characteristics commonly observed in seed plants. more than 20,000 species of ferns live in environments ranging from tropics to temperate forests. although some species survive in dry environments, most ferns are restricted to moist, shaded places. ferns made their appearance in the fossil record during the devonian period and expanded during the carboniferous. the dominant stage of the lifecycle of a fern is the sporophyte, which consists of large compound leaves called fronds. fronds fulfill a double role; they are photosynthetic organs that also carry reproductive organs. the stem may be buried underground as a rhizome, from which adventitious roots grow to absorb water and nutrients from the soil; or, they may grow above ground as a trunk in tree ferns ([link]). adventitious organs are those that grow in unusual places, such as roots growing from the side of a stem. the tip of a developing fern frond is rolled into a crozier, or fiddlehead ([link]a and [link]b). fiddleheads unroll as the frond develops. the lifecycle of a fern is depicted in [link]. most ferns produce the same type of spores and are therefore homosporous. the diploid sporophyte is the most conspicuous stage of the lifecycle. on the underside of its mature fronds, sori (singular, sorus) form as small clusters where sporangia develop ([link]). inside the sori, spores are produced by meiosis and released into the air. those that land on a suitable substrate germinate and form a heart-shaped gametophyte, which is attached to the ground by thin filamentous rhizoids ([link]). the inconspicuous gametophyte harbors both sex gametangia. flagellated sperm released from the antheridium swim on a wet surface to the archegonium, where the egg is fertilized. the newly formed zygote grows into a sporophyte that emerges from the gametophyte and grows by mitosis into the next generation sporophyte. landscape designerlooking at the well-laid parterres of flowers and fountains in the grounds of royal castles and historic houses of europe, its clear that the gardens creators knew about more than art and design. they were also familiar with the biology of the plants they chose. landscape design also has strong roots in the united states tradition. a prime example of early american classical design is monticello: thomas jeffersons private estate. among his many interests, jefferson maintained a strong passion for botany. landscape layout can encompass a small private space, like a backyard garden; public gathering places, like central park in new york city; or an entire city plan, like pierre lenfants design for washington, dc. a landscape designer will plan traditional public spacessuch as botanical gardens, parks, college campuses, gardens, and larger developmentsas well as natural areas and private gardens. the restoration of natural places encroached on by human intervention, such as wetlands, also requires the expertise of a landscape designer. with such an array of necessary skills, a landscape designers education includes a solid background in botany, soil science, plant pathology, entomology, and horticulture. coursework in architecture and design software is also required for the completion of the degree. the successful design of a landscape rests on an extensive knowledge of plant growth requirements, such as light and shade, moisture levels, compatibility of different species, and susceptibility to pathogens and pests. mosses and ferns will thrive in a shaded area, where fountains provide moisture; cacti, on the other hand, would not fare well in that environment. the future growth of individual plants must be taken into account, to avoid crowding and competition for light and nutrients. the appearance of the space over time is also of concern. shapes, colors, and biology must be balanced for a well-maintained and sustainable green space. art, architecture, and biology blend in a beautifully designed and implemented landscape. mosses and liverworts are often the first macroscopic organisms to colonize an area, both in a primary successionwhere bare land is settled for the first time by living organismsor in a secondary succession, where soil remains intact after a catastrophic event wipes out many existing species. their spores are carried by the wind, birds, or insects. once mosses and liverworts are established, they provide food and shelter for other species. in a hostile environment, like the tundra where the soil is frozen, bryophytes grow well because they do not have roots and can dry and rehydrate rapidly once water is again available. mosses are at the base of the food chain in the tundra biome. many speciesfrom small insects to musk oxen and reindeerdepend on mosses for food. in turn, predators feed on the herbivores, which are the primary consumers. some reports indicate that bryophytes make the soil more amenable to colonization by other plants. because they establish symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, mosses replenish the soil with nitrogen. at the end of the nineteenth century, scientists observed that lichens and mosses were becoming increasingly rare in urban and suburban areas. since bryophytes have neither a root system for absorption of water and nutrients, nor a cuticle layer that protects them from desiccation, pollutants in rainwater readily penetrate their tissues; they absorb moisture and nutrients through their entire exposed surfaces. therefore, pollutants dissolved in rainwater penetrate plant tissues readily and have a larger impact on mosses than on other plants. the disappearance of mosses can be considered a bioindicator for the level of pollution in the environment. ferns contribute to the environment by promoting the weathering of rock, accelerating the formation of topsoil, and slowing down erosion by spreading rhizomes in the soil. the water ferns of the genus azolla harbor nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and restore this important nutrient to aquatic habitats. seedless plants have historically played a role in human life through uses as tools, fuel, and medicine. dried peat moss, sphagnum, is commonly used as fuel in some parts of europe and is considered a renewable resource. sphagnum bogs ([link]) are cultivated with cranberry and blueberry bushes. the ability of sphagnum to hold moisture makes the moss a common soil conditioner. florists use blocks of sphagnum to maintain moisture for floral arrangements. the attractive fronds of ferns make them a favorite ornamental plant. because they thrive in low light, they are well suited as house plants. more importantly, fiddleheads are a traditional spring food of native americans in the pacific northwest, and are popular as a side dish in french cuisine. the licorice fern, polypodium glycyrrhiza, is part of the diet of the pacific northwest coastal tribes, owing in part to the sweetness of its rhizomes. it has a faint licorice taste and serves as a sweetener. the rhizome also figures in the pharmacopeia of native americans for its medicinal properties and is used as a remedy for sore throat. by far the greatest impact of seedless vascular plants on human life, however, comes from their extinct progenitors. the tall club mosses, horsetails, and tree-like ferns that flourished in the swampy forests of the carboniferous period gave rise to large deposits of coal throughout the world. coal provided an abundant source of energy during the industrial revolution, which had tremendous consequences on human societies, including rapid technological progress and growth of large cities, as well as the degradation of the environment. coal is still a prime source of energy and also a major contributor to global warming. vascular systems consist of xylem tissue, which transports water and minerals, and phloem tissue, which transports sugars and proteins. with the development of the vascular system, there appeared leaves to act as large photosynthetic organs, and roots to access water from the ground. small uncomplicated leaves are microphylls. large leaves with vein patterns are megaphylls. modified leaves that bear sporangia are sporophylls. some sporophylls are arranged in cone structures called strobili. the seedless vascular plants include club mosses, which are the most primitive; whisk ferns, which lost leaves and roots by reductive evolution; and horsetails and ferns. ferns are the most advanced group of seedless vascular plants. they are distinguished by large leaves called fronds and small sporangia-containing structures called sori, which are found on the underside of the fronds. mosses play an essential role in the balance of the ecosystems;

131,stax-bio,26,Seed Plants,1,m44653,Evolution of Seed Plants,"the first plants to colonize land were most likely closely related to modern day mosses (bryophytes) and are thought to have appeared about 500 million years ago. they were followed by liverworts (also bryophytes) and primitive vascular plantsthe pterophytesfrom which modern ferns are derived. the lifecycle of bryophytes and pterophytes is characterized by the alternation of generations, like gymnosperms and angiosperms; what sets bryophytes and pterophytes apart from gymnosperms and angiosperms is their reproductive requirement for water. the completion of the bryophyte and pterophyte life cycle requires water because the male gametophyte releases sperm, which must swimpropelled by their flagellato reach and fertilize the female gamete or egg. after fertilization, the zygote matures and grows into a sporophyte, which in turn will form sporangia or ""spore vessels."" in the sporangia, mother cells undergo meiosis and produce the haploid spores. release of spores in a suitable environment will lead to germination and a new generation of gametophytes. in seed plants, the evolutionary trend led to a dominant sporophyte generation, and at the same time, a systematic reduction in the size of the gametophyte: from a conspicuous structure to a microscopic cluster of cells enclosed in the tissues of the sporophyte. whereas lower vascular plants, such as club mosses and ferns, are mostly homosporous (produce only one type of spore), all seed plants, or spermatophytes, are heterosporous. they form two types of spores: megaspores (female) and microspores (male). megaspores develop into female gametophytes that produce eggs, and microspores mature into male gametophytes that generate sperm. because the gametophytes mature within the spores, they are not free-living, as are the gametophytes of other seedless vascular plants. heterosporous seedless plants are seen as the evolutionary forerunners of seed plants. seeds and pollentwo critical adaptations to drought, and to reproduction that doesnt require waterdistinguish seed plants from other (seedless) vascular plants. both adaptations were required for the colonization of land begun by the bryophytes and their ancestors. fossils place the earliest distinct seed plants at about 350 million years ago. the first reliable record of gymnosperms dates their appearance to the pennsylvanian period, about 319 million years ago ([link]). gymnosperms were preceded by progymnosperms, the first naked seed plants, which arose about 380 million years ago. progymnosperms were a transitional group of plants that superficially resembled conifers (cone bearers) because they produced wood from the secondary growth of the vascular tissues; however, they still reproduced like ferns, releasing spores into the environment. gymnosperms dominated the landscape in the early (triassic) and middle (jurassic) mesozoic era. angiosperms surpassed gymnosperms by the middle of the cretaceous (about 100 million years ago) in the late mesozoic era, and today are the most abundant plant group in most terrestrial biomes. pollen and seed were innovative structures that allowed seed plants to break their dependence on water for reproduction and development of the embryo, and to conquer dry land. the pollen grains are the male gametophytes, which contain the sperm (gametes) of the plant. the small haploid (1n) cells are encased in a protective coat that prevents desiccation (drying out) and mechanical damage. pollen grains can travel far from their original sporophyte, spreading the plants genes. the seed offers the embryo protection, nourishment, and a mechanism to maintain dormancy for tens or even thousands of years, ensuring germination can occur when growth conditions are optimal. seeds therefore allow plants to disperse the next generation through both space and time. with such evolutionary advantages, seed plants have become the most successful and familiar group of plants, in part because of their size and striking appearance. the fossil plant elkinsia polymorpha, a ""seed fern"" from the devonian periodabout 400million years agois considered the earliest seed plant known to date. seed ferns ([link]) produced their seeds along their branches without specialized structures. what makes them the first true seed plants is that they developed structures called cupules to enclose and protect the ovulethe female gametophyte and associated tissueswhich develops into a seed upon fertilization. seed plants resembling modern tree ferns became more numerous and diverse in the coal swamps of the carboniferous period. fossil records indicate the first gymnosperms (progymnosperms) most likely originated in the paleozoic era, during the middle devonian period: about 390 million years ago. following the wet mississippian and pennsylvanian periods, which were dominated by giant fern trees, the permian period was dry. this gave a reproductive edge to seed plants, which are better adapted to survive dry spells. the ginkgoales, a group of gymnosperms with only one surviving speciesthe gingko bilobawere the first gymnosperms to appear during the lower jurassic. gymnosperms expanded in the mesozoic era (about 240 million years ago), supplanting ferns in the landscape, and reaching their greatest diversity during this time. the jurassic period was as much the age of the cycads (palm-tree-like gymnosperms) as the age of the dinosaurs. gingkoales and the more familiar conifers also dotted the landscape. although angiosperms (flowering plants) are the major form of plant life in most biomes, gymnosperms still dominate some ecosystems, such as the taiga (boreal forests) and the alpine forests at higher mountain elevations ([link]) because of their adaptation to cold and dry growth conditions. unlike bryophyte and fern spores (which are haploid cells dependent on moisture for rapid development of gametophytes), seeds contain a diploid embryo that will germinate into a sporophyte. storage tissue to sustain growth and a protective coat give seeds their superior evolutionary advantage. several layers of hardened tissue prevent desiccation, and free reproduction from the need for a constant supply of water. furthermore, seeds remain in a state of dormancyinduced by desiccation and the hormone abscisic aciduntil conditions for growth become favorable. whether blown by the wind, floating on water, or carried away by animals, seeds are scattered in an expanding geographic range, thus avoiding competition with the parent plant. pollen grains ([link]) are male gametophytes and are carried by wind, water, or a pollinator. the whole structure is protected from desiccation and can reach the female organs without dependence on water. male gametes reach female gametophyte and the egg cell gamete though a pollen tube: an extension of a cell within the pollen grain. the sperm of modern gymnosperms lack flagella, but in cycads and the gingko, the sperm still possess flagella that allow them to swim down the pollen tube to the female gamete; however, they are enclosed in a pollen grain. undisputed fossil records place the massive appearance and diversification of angiosperms in the middle to late mesozoic era. angiosperms (seed in a vessel) produce a flower containing male and/or female reproductive structures. fossil evidence ([link]) indicates that flowering plants first appeared in the lower cretaceous, about 125 million years ago, and were rapidly diversifying by the middle cretaceous, about 100 million years ago. earlier traces of angiosperms are scarce. fossilized pollen recovered from jurassic geological material has been attributed to angiosperms. a few early cretaceous rocks show clear imprints of leaves resembling angiosperm leaves. by the mid-cretaceous, a staggering number of diverse flowering plants crowd the fossil record. the same geological period is also marked by the appearance of many modern groups of insects, including pollinating insects that played a key role in ecology and the evolution of flowering plants. although several hypotheses have been offered to explain this sudden profusion and variety of flowering plants, none have garnered the consensus of paleobotanists (scientists who study ancient plants). new data in comparative genomics and paleobotany have, however, shed some light on the evolution of angiosperms. rather than being derived from gymnosperms, angiosperms form a sister clade (a species and its descendents) that developed in parallel with the gymnosperms. the two innovative structures of flowers and fruit represent an improved reproductive strategy that served to protect the embryo, while increasing genetic variability and range. paleobotanists debate whether angiosperms evolved from small woody bushes, or were basal angiosperms related to tropical grasses. both views draw support from cladistics studies, and the so-called woody magnoliid hypothesiswhich proposes that the early ancestors of angiosperms were shrubsalso offers molecular biological evidence. the most primitive living angiosperm is considered to be amborella trichopoda, a small plant native to the rainforest of new caledonia, an island in the south pacific. analysis of the genome of a. trichopoda has shown that it is related to all existing flowering plants and belongs to the oldest confirmed branch of the angiosperm family tree. a few other angiosperm groups called basal angiosperms, are viewed as primitive because they branched off early from the phylogenetic tree. most modern angiosperms are classified as either monocots or eudicots, based on the structure of their leaves and embryos. basal angiosperms, such as water lilies, are considered more primitive because they share morphological traits with both monocots and eudicots. angiosperms produce their gametes in separate organs, which are usually housed in a flower. both fertilization and embryo development take place inside an anatomical structure that provides a stable system of sexual reproduction largely sheltered from environmental fluctuations. flowering plants are the most diverse phylum on earth after insects; flowers come in a bewildering array of sizes, shapes, colors, smells, and arrangements. most flowers have a mutualistic pollinator, with the distinctive features of flowers reflecting the nature of the pollination agent. the relationship between pollinator and flower characteristics is one of the great examples of coevolution. following fertilization of the egg, the ovule grows into a seed. the surrounding tissues of the ovary thicken, developing into a fruit that will protect the seed and often ensure its dispersal over a wide geographic range. not all fruits develop from an ovary; such structures are false fruits. like flowers, fruit can vary tremendously in appearance, size, smell, and taste. tomatoes, walnut shells and avocados are all examples of fruit. as with pollen and seeds, fruits also act as agents of dispersal. some may be carried away by the wind. many attract animals that will eat the fruit and pass the seeds through their digestive systems, then deposit the seeds in another location. cockleburs are covered with stiff, hooked spines that can hook into fur (or clothing) and hitch a ride on an animal for long distances. the cockleburs that clung to the velvet trousers of an enterprising swiss hiker, george de mestral, inspired his invention of the loop and hook fastener he named velcro. building phylogenetic trees with analysis of dna sequence alignmentsall living organisms display patterns of relationships derived from their evolutionary history. phylogeny is the science that describes the relative connections between organisms, in terms of ancestral and descendant species. phylogenetic trees, such as the plant evolutionary history shown in [link], are tree-like branching diagrams that depict these relationships. species are found at the tips of the branches. each branching point, called a node, is the point at which a single taxonomic group (taxon), such as a species, separates into two or more species. phylogenetic trees have been built to describe the relationships between species since darwins time. traditional methods involve comparison of homologous anatomical structures and embryonic development, assuming that closely related organisms share anatomical features during embryo development. some traits that disappear in the adult are present in the embryo; for example, a human fetus, at one point, has a tail. the study of fossil records shows the intermediate stages that link an ancestral form to its descendants. most of these approaches are imprecise and lend themselves to multiple interpretations. as the tools of molecular biology and computational analysis have been developed and perfected in recent years, a new generation of tree-building methods has taken shape. the key assumption is that genes for essential proteins or rna structures, such as the ribosomal rna, are inherently conserved because mutations (changes in the dna sequence) could compromise the survival of the organism. dna from minute amounts of living organisms or fossils can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequenced, targeting the regions of the genome that are most likely to be conserved between species. the genes encoding the ribosomal rna from the small 18s subunit and plastid genes are frequently chosen for dna alignment analysis. once the sequences of interest are obtained, they are compared with existing sequences in databases such as genbank, which is maintained by the national center for biotechnology information. a number of computational tools are available to align and analyze sequences. sophisticated computer analysis programs determine the percentage of sequence identity or homology. sequence homology can be used to estimate the evolutionary distance between two dna sequences and reflect the time elapsed since the genes separated from a common ancestor. molecular analysis has revolutionized phylogenetic trees. in some cases, prior results from morphological studies have been confirmed: for example, confirming amborella trichopoda as the most primitive angiosperm known. however, some groups and relationships have been rearranged as a result of dna analysis. seed plants appeared about one million years ago, during the carboniferous period. two major innovationsseed and pollenallowed seed plants to reproduce in the absence of water. the gametophytes of seed plants shrank, while the sporophytes became prominent structures and the diploid stage became the longest phase of the lifecycle. gymnosperms became the dominant group during the triassic. in these, pollen grains and seeds protect against desiccation. the seed, unlike a spore, is a diploid embryo surrounded by storage tissue and protective layers. it is equipped to delay germination until growth conditions are optimal. angiosperms bear both flowers and fruit. the structures protect the gametes and the embryo during its development. angiosperms appeared during the mesozoic era and have become the dominant plant life in terrestrial habitats.","[('pollen grain', 'pollen grains'), ('seed plant', 'seed plants'), ('flower evolution', 'flower evolutions'), ('plant adaptation', 'plant adaptations'), ('pollen', 'pollens'), ('seed plant evolution', 'seed plant evolutions', 'seed plants evolution', 'seed plants evolutions', 'seeds plant evolution', 'seeds plant evolutions', 'seeds plants evolution', 'seeds plants evolutions'), ('fruit evolution', 'fruit evolutions'), ('seed evolution', 'seed evolutions'), ('seed plant reproduction', 'seed plant reproductions', 'seed plants reproduction', 'seed plants reproductions', 'seeds plant reproduction', 'seeds plant reproductions', 'seeds plants reproduction', 'seeds plants reproductions'), ('flower', 'flowers'), ('fruit', 'fruit'), ('spermatophyte', 'spermatophytes'), ('microspore', 'microspores'), ('homosporou', 'homosporouss', 'homosporous'), ('pollen evolution', 'pollen evolutions'), ('angiosperm evolution', 'angiosperm evolutions'), ('ovule', 'ovules'), ('angiosperm', 'angiosperms'), ('pollen tube', 'pollen tubes'), ('plant phylogeny', 'plant phylogenies'), ('megaspore', 'megaspores'), ('seed', 'seeds'), ('heterosporou', 'heterosporouss', 'heterosporous'), ('carboniferous period', 'carboniferous periods'), ('adaptation to land', 'adaptation to land', 'adaptations to land', 'adaptations to land'), ('gymnosperm', 'gymnosperms'), ('gymnosperm evolution', 'gymnosperm evolutions'), ('progymnosperm', 'progymnosperms')]"
132,stax-bio,26,Seed Plants,2,m44648,Gymnosperms,"gymnosperms, meaning naked seeds, are a diverse group of seed plants and are paraphyletic. paraphyletic groups are those in which not all members are descendants of a single common ancestor. their characteristics include naked seeds, separate female and male gametes, pollination by wind, and tracheids (which transport water and solutes in the vascular system). gymnosperm seeds are not enclosed in an ovary; rather, they are exposed on cones or modified leaves. sporophylls are specialized leaves that produce sporangia. the term strobilus (plural = strobili) describes a tight arrangement of sporophylls around a central stalk, as seen in cones. some seeds are enveloped by sporophyte tissues upon maturation. the layer of sporophyte tissue that surrounds the megasporangium, and later, the embryo, is called the integument. gymnosperms were the dominant phylum in mesozoic era. they are adapted to live where fresh water is scarce during part of the year, or in the nitrogen-poor soil of a bog. therefore, they are still the prominent phylum in the coniferous biome or taiga, where the evergreen conifers have a selective advantage in cold and dry weather. evergreen conifers continue low levels of photosynthesis during the cold months, and are ready to take advantage of the first sunny days of spring. one disadvantage is that conifers are more susceptible than deciduous trees to infestations because conifers do not lose their leaves all at once. they cannot, therefore, shed parasites and restart with a fresh supply of leaves in spring. the life cycle of a gymnosperm involves alternation of generations, with a dominant sporophyte in which the female gametophyte resides, and reduced gametophytes. all gymnosperms are heterosporous. the male and female reproductive organs can form in cones or strobili. male and female sporangia are produced either on the same plant, described as monoecious (one home or bisexual), or on separate plants, referred to as dioecious (two homes or unisexual) plants. the life cycle of a conifer will serve as our example of reproduction in gymnosperms. pine trees are conifers (cone bearing) and carry both male and female sporophylls on the same mature sporophyte. therefore, they are monoecious plants. like all gymnosperms, pines are heterosporous and generate two different types of spores: male microspores and female megaspores. in the male cones, or staminate cones, the microsporocytes give rise to pollen grains by meiosis. in the spring, large amounts of yellow pollen are released and carried by the wind. some gametophytes will land on a female cone. pollination is defined as the initiation of pollen tube growth. the pollen tube develops slowly, and the generative cell in the pollen grain divides into two haploid sperm cells by mitosis. at fertilization, one of the sperm cells will finally unite its haploid nucleus with the haploid nucleus of a haploid egg cell. female cones, or ovulate cones, contain two ovules per scale. one megaspore mother cell, or megasporocyte, undergoes meiosis in each ovule. three of the four cells break down; only a single surviving cell will develop into a female multicellular gametophyte, which encloses archegonia (an archegonium is a reproductive organ that contains a single large egg). upon fertilization, the diploid egg will give rise to the embryo, which is enclosed in a seed coat of tissue from the parent plant. fertilization and seed development is a long process in pine trees: it may take up to two years after pollination. the seed that is formed contains three generations of tissues: the seed coat that originates from the sporophyte tissue, the gametophyte that will provide nutrients, and the embryo itself. [link] illustrates the life cycle of a conifer. the sporophyte (2n) phase is the longest phase in the life of a gymnosperm. the gametophytes (1n)microspores and megasporesare reduced in size. it may take more than year between pollination and fertilization while the pollen tube grows towards the megasporocyte (2n), which undergoes meiosis into megaspores. the megaspores will mature into eggs (1n). watch this video to see the process of seed production in gymnosperms.

 modern gymnosperms are classified into four phyla. coniferophyta, cycadophyta, and ginkgophyta are similar in their production of secondary cambium (cells that generate the vascular system of the trunk or stem and are partially specialized for water transportation) and their pattern of seed development. however, the three phyla are not closely related phylogenetically to each other. gnetophyta are considered the closest group to angiosperms because they produce true xylem tissue. conifers are the dominant phylum of gymnosperms, with the most variety of species ([link]). most are typically tall trees that usually bear scale-like or needle-like leaves. water evaporation from leaves is reduced by their thin shape and the thick cuticle. snow slides easily off needle-shaped leaves, keeping the load light and decreasing breaking of branches. adaptations to cold and dry weather explain the predominance of conifers at high altitudes and in cold climates. conifers include familiar evergreen trees such as pines, spruces, firs, cedars, sequoias, and yews. a few species are deciduous and lose their leaves in fall. the european larch and the tamarack are examples of deciduous conifers ([link]c). many coniferous trees are harvested for paper pulp and timber. the wood of conifers is more primitive than the wood of angiosperms; it contains tracheids, but no vessel elements, and is therefore referred to as soft wood. cycads thrive in mild climates, and are often mistaken for palms because of the shape of their large, compound leaves. cycads bear large cones ([link]), and may be pollinated by beetles rather than wind: unusual for a gymnosperm. they dominated the landscape during the age of dinosaurs in the mesozoic, but only a hundred or so species persisted to modern times. they face possible extinction, and several species are protected through international conventions. because of their attractive shape, they are often used as ornamental plants in gardens in the tropics and subtropics. the single surviving species of the gingkophytes group is the gingko biloba ([link]). its fan-shaped leavesunique among seed plants because they feature a dichotomous venation patternturn yellow in autumn and fall from the tree. for centuries, g. biloba was cultivated by chinese buddhist monks in monasteries, which ensured its preservation. it is planted in public spaces because it is unusually resistant to pollution. male and female organs are produced on separate plants. typically, gardeners plant only male trees because the seeds produced by the female plant have an off-putting smell of rancid butter. gnetophytes are the closest relative to modern angiosperms, and include three dissimilar genera of plants: ephedra, gnetum, and welwitschia ([link]). like angiosperms, they have broad leaves. in tropical and subtropical zones, gnetophytes are vines or small shrubs. ephedra occurs in dry areas of the west coast of the united states and mexico. ephedras small, scale-like leaves are the source of the compound ephedrine, which is used in medicine as a potent decongestant. because ephedrine is similar to amphetamines, both in chemical structure and neurological effects, its use is restricted to prescription drugs. like angiosperms, but unlike other gymnosperms, all gnetophytes possess vessel elements in their xylem. watch this bbc video describing the amazing strangeness of welwitschia.

 gymnosperms are heterosporous seed plants that produce naked seeds. they appeared in the paleozoic period and were the dominant plant life during the mesozoic. modern-day gymnosperms belong to four phyla. the largest phylum, coniferophyta, is represented by conifers, the predominant plants at high altitude and latitude. cycads (phylum cycadophyta) resemble palm trees and grow in tropical climates. gingko biloba is the only representative of the phylum gingkophyta. the last phylum, gnetophyta, is a diverse group of shrubs that produce vessel elements in their wood.","[('microsporocyte', 'microsporocytes'), ('megasporocyte', 'megasporocytes'), ('strobilu', 'strobiluss', 'strobilus'), ('gnetophyte', 'gnetophytes'), ('cycad', 'cycads'), ('seed plant', 'seed plants'), ('heterosporous seed plant', 'heterosporous seed plants', 'heterosporous seeds plant', 'heterosporous seeds plants'), ('monoeciou', 'monoeciouss', 'monoecious'), ('gymnosperm diversity', 'gymnosperm diversities'), ('conifer life cycle', 'conifer life cycles', 'conifer lives cycle', 'conifer lives cycles', 'conifers life cycle', 'conifers life cycles', 'conifers lives cycle', 'conifers lives cycles'), ('gingkophyte', 'gingkophytes'), ('dioeciou', 'dioeciouss', 'dioecious'), ('gymnosperm seed', 'gymnosperm seeds'), ('gingko biloba', 'gingko bilobas'), ('integument', 'integuments'), ('gymnosperm', 'gymnosperms'), ('paleozoic period', 'paleozoic periods'), ('cone', 'cones')]"
133,stax-bio,26,Seed Plants,3,m44650,Angiosperms,"from their humble and still obscure beginning during the early jurassic period, the angiospermsor flowering plantshave evolved to dominate most terrestrial ecosystems ([link]). with more than 250,000 species, the angiosperm phylum (anthophyta) is second only to insects in terms of diversification. the success of angiosperms is due to two novel reproductive structures: flowers and fruit. the function of the flower is to ensure pollination. flowers also provide protection for the ovule and developing embryo inside a receptacle. the function of the fruit is seed dispersal. they also protect the developing seed. different fruit structures or tissues on fruitsuch as sweet flesh, wings, parachutes, or spines that grabreflect the dispersal strategies that help spread seeds. flowers are modified leaves, or sporophylls, organized around a central stalk. although they vary greatly in appearance, all flowers contain the same structures: sepals, petals, carpels, and stamens. the peduncle attaches the flower to the plant. a whorl of sepals (collectively called the calyx) is located at the base of the peduncle and encloses the unopened floral bud. sepals are usually photosynthetic organs, although there are some exceptions. for example, the corolla in lilies and tulips consists of three sepals and three petals that look virtually identical. petals, collectively the corolla, are located inside the whorl of sepals and often display vivid colors to attract pollinators. flowers pollinated by wind are usually small, feathery, and visually inconspicuous. sepals and petals together form the perianth. the sexual organs (carpels and stamens) are located at the center of the flower. as illustrated in [link], styles, stigmas, and ovules constitute the female organ: the gynoecium or carpel. flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may be singular, multiple, or fused. multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil. the megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel. a long, thin structure called a style leads from the sticky stigma, where pollen is deposited, to the ovary, enclosed in the carpel. the ovary houses one or more ovules, each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization. the male reproductive organs, the stamens (collectively called the androecium), surround the central carpel. stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac-like structure called the anther. the filament supports the anther, where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains. as the seed develops, the walls of the ovary thicken and form the fruit. the seed forms in an ovary, which also enlarges as the seeds grow. in botany, a fertilized and fully grown, ripened ovary is a fruit. many foods commonly called vegetables are actually fruit. eggplants, zucchini, string beans, and bell peppers are all technically fruit because they contain seeds and are derived from the thick ovary tissue. acorns are nuts, and winged maple whirligigs (whose botanical name is samara) are also fruit. botanists classify fruit into more than two dozen different categories, only a few of which are actually fleshy and sweet. mature fruit can be fleshy or dry. fleshy fruit include the familiar berries, peaches, apples, grapes, and tomatoes. rice, wheat, and nuts are examples of dry fruit. another distinction is that not all fruits are derived from the ovary. for instance, strawberries are derived from the receptacle and apples from the pericarp, or hypanthium. some fruits are derived from separate ovaries in a single flower, such as the raspberry. other fruits, such as the pineapple, form from clusters of flowers. additionally, some fruits, like watermelon and orange, have rinds. regardless of how they are formed, fruits are an agent of seed dispersal. the variety of shapes and characteristics reflect the mode of dispersal. wind carries the light dry fruit of trees and dandelions. water transports floating coconuts. some fruits attract herbivores with color or perfume, or as food. once eaten, tough, undigested seeds are dispersed through the herbivores feces. other fruits have burs and hooks to cling to fur and hitch rides on animals. the adult, or sporophyte, phase is the main phase of an angiosperms life cycle ([link]). like gymnosperms, angiosperms are heterosporous. therefore, they generate microspores, which will generate pollen grains as the male gametophytes, and megaspores, which will form an ovule that contains female gametophytes. inside the anthers microsporangia, male gametophytes divide by meiosis to generate haploid microspores, which, in turn, undergo mitosis and give rise to pollen grains. each pollen grain contains two cells: one generative cell that will divide into two sperm and a second cell that will become the pollen tube cell. the ovule, sheltered within the ovary of the carpel, contains the megasporangium protected by two layers of integuments and the ovary wall. within each megasporangium, a megasporocyte undergoes meiosis, generating four megasporesthree small and one large. only the large megaspore survives; it produces the female gametophyte, referred to as the embryo sac. the megaspore divides three times to form an eight-cell stage. four of these cells migrate to each pole of the embryo sac; two come to the equator, and will eventually fuse to form a 2n polar nucleus; the three cells away from the egg form antipodals, and the two cells closest to the egg become the synergids. the mature embryo sac contains one egg cell, two synergids or helper cells, three antipodal cells, and two polar nuclei in a central cell. when a pollen grain reaches the stigma, a pollen tube extends from the grain, grows down the style, and enters through the micropyle: an opening in the integuments of the ovule. the two sperm cells are deposited in the embryo sac. a double fertilization event then occurs. one sperm and the egg combine, forming a diploid zygotethe future embryo. the other sperm fuses with the 2n polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that will develop into the endosperm, which is tissue that serves as a food reserve. the zygote develops into an embryo with a radicle, or small root, and one (monocot) or two (dicot) leaf-like organs called cotyledons. this difference in the number of embryonic leaves is the basis for the two major groups of angiosperms: the monocots and the eudicots. seed food reserves are stored outside the embryo, in the form of complex carbohydrates, lipids or proteins. the cotyledons serve as conduits to transmit the broken-down food reserves from their storage site inside the seed to the developing embryo. the seed consists of a toughened layer of integuments forming the coat, the endosperm with food reserves, and at the center, the well-protected embryo. most flowers are monoecious or bisexual, which means that they carry both stamens and carpels; only a few species self-pollinate. monoecious flowers are also known as perfect flowers because they contain both types of sex organs ([link]). both anatomical and environmental barriers promote cross-pollination mediated by a physical agent (wind or water), or an animal, such as an insect or bird. cross-pollination increases genetic diversity in a species. angiosperms are classified in a single phylum: the anthophyta. modern angiosperms appear to be a monophyletic group, which means that they originate from a single ancestor. flowering plants are divided into two major groups, according to the structure of the cotyledons, pollen grains, and other structures. monocots include grasses and lilies, and eudicots or dicots form a polyphyletic group. basal angiosperms are a group of plants that are believed to have branched off before the separation into monocots and eudicots because they exhibit traits from both groups. they are categorized separately in many classification schemes. the magnoliidae (magnolia trees, laurels, and water lilies) and the piperaceae (peppers) belong to the basal angiosperm group. the magnoliidae are represented by the magnolias: tall trees bearing large, fragrant flowers that have many parts and are considered archaic ([link]d). laurel trees produce fragrant leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. the laurales grow mostly in warmer climates and are small trees and shrubs. familiar plants in this group include the bay laurel, cinnamon, spice bush ([link]a), and avocado tree. the nymphaeales are comprised of the water lilies, lotus ([link]c), and similar plants; all species thrive in freshwater biomes, and have leaves that float on the water surface or grow underwater. water lilies are particularly prized by gardeners, and have graced ponds and pools for thousands of years. the piperales are a group of herbs, shrubs, and small trees that grow in the tropical climates. they have small flowers without petals that are tightly arranged in long spikes. many species are the source of prized fragrance or spices, for example the berries of piper nigrum ([link]b) are the familiar black peppercorns that are used to flavor many dishes. plants in the monocot group are primarily identified as such by the presence of a single cotyledon in the seedling. other anatomical features shared by monocots include veins that run parallel to the length of the leaves, and flower parts that are arranged in a three- or six-fold symmetry. true woody tissue is rarely found in monocots. in palm trees, vascular and parenchyma tissues produced by the primary and secondary thickening meristems form the trunk. the pollen from the first angiosperms was monosulcate, containing a single furrow or pore through the outer layer. this feature is still seen in the modern monocots. vascular tissue of the stem is not arranged in any particular pattern. the root system is mostly adventitious and unusually positioned, with no major tap root. the monocots include familiar plants such as the true lilies (which are at the origin of their alternate name of liliopsida), orchids, grasses, and palms. many important crops are monocots, such as rice and other cereals, corn, sugar cane, and tropical fruits like bananas and pineapples ([link]). eudicots, or true dicots, are characterized by the presence of two cotyledons in the developing shoot. veins form a network in leaves, and flower parts come in four, five, or many whorls. vascular tissue forms a ring in the stem; in monocots, vascular tissue is scattered in the stem. eudicots can be herbaceous (like grasses), or produce woody tissues. most eudicots produce pollen that is trisulcate or triporate, with three furrows or pores. the root system is usually anchored by one main root developed from the embryonic radicle. eudicots comprise two-thirds of all flowering plants. the major differences between monocots and eudicots are summarized in [link]. many species exhibit characteristics that belong to either group; as such, the classification of a plant as a monocot or a eudicot is not always clearly evident. angiosperms are the dominant form of plant life in most terrestrial ecosystems, comprising about 90 percent of all plant species. most crops and ornamental plants are angiosperms. their success comes from two innovative structures that protect reproduction from variability in the environment: the flower and the fruit. flowers were derived from modified leaves. the main parts of a flower are the sepals and petals, which protect the reproductive parts: the stamens and the carpels. the stamens produce the male gametes in pollen grains. the carpels contain the female gametes (the eggs inside the ovules), which are within the ovary of a carpel. the walls of the ovary thicken after fertilization, ripening into fruit that ensures dispersal by wind, water, or animals. the angiosperm life cycle is dominated by the sporophyte stage. double fertilization is an event unique to angiosperms. one sperm in the pollen fertilizes the egg, forming a diploid zygote, while the other combines with the two polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that develops into a food storage tissue called the endosperm. flowering plants are divided into two main groups, the monocots and eudicots, according to the number of cotyledons in the seedlings. basal angiosperms belong to an older lineage than monocots and eudicots.","[('anthophytum', 'anthophytas', 'anthophyta'),

134,stax-bio,26,Seed Plants,4,m44652,The Role of Seed Plants,"without seed plants, life as we know it would not be possible. plants play a key role in the maintenance of terrestrial ecosystems through stabilization of soils, cycling of carbon, and climate moderation. large tropical forests release oxygen and act as carbon dioxide sinks. seed plants provide shelter to many life forms, as well as food for herbivores, thereby indirectly feeding carnivores. plant secondary metabolites are used for medicinal purposes and industrial production. coevolution of flowering plants and insects is a hypothesis that has received much attention and support, especially because both angiosperms and insects diversified at about the same time in the middle mesozoic. many authors have attributed the diversity of plants and insects to pollination and herbivory, or consumption of plants by insects and other animals. this is believed to have been as much a driving force as pollination. coevolution of herbivores and plant defenses is observed in nature. unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry animals. a sort of arms race exists between plants and herbivores. to combat herbivores, some plant seedssuch as acorn and unripened persimmonare high in alkaloids and therefore unsavory to some animals. other plants are protected by bark, although some animals developed specialized mouth pieces to tear and chew vegetal material. spines and thorns ([link]) deter most animals, except for mammals with thick fur, and some birds have specialized beaks to get past such defenses. herbivory has been used by seed plants for their own benefit in a display of mutualistic relationships. the dispersal of fruit by animals is the most striking example. the plant offers to the herbivore a nutritious source of food in return for spreading the plants genetic material to a wider area. an extreme example of collaboration between an animal and a plant is the case of acacia trees and ants. the trees support the insects with shelter and food. in return, ants discourage herbivores, both invertebrates and vertebrates, by stinging and attacking leaf-eating insects. grasses are a successful group of flowering plants that are wind pollinated. they produce large amounts of powdery pollen carried over large distances by the wind. the flowers are small and wisp-like. large trees such as oaks, maples, and birches are also wind pollinated. more than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination: the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma. consequently, plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators. the specificity of specialized plant structures that target animals can be very surprising. it is possible, for example, to determine the type of pollinator favored by a plant just from the flowers characteristics. many bird or insect-pollinated flowers secrete nectar, which is a sugary liquid. they also produce both fertile pollen, for reproduction, and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for birds and insects. butterflies and bees can detect ultraviolet light. flowers that attract these pollinators usually display a pattern of low ultraviolet reflectance that helps them quickly locate the flower's center and collect nectar while being dusted with pollen ([link]). large, red flowers with little smell and a long funnel shape are preferred by hummingbirds, who have good color perception, a poor sense of smell, and need a strong perch. white flowers opened at night attract moths. other animalssuch as bats, lemurs, and lizardscan also act as pollinating agents. any disruption to these interactions, such as the disappearance of bees as a consequence of colony collapse disorders, can lead to disaster for agricultural industries that depend heavily on pollinated crops. testing attraction of flies by rotting flesh smellquestion: will flowers that offer cues to bees attract carrion flies if sprayed with compounds that smell like rotten flesh? background: visitation of flowers by pollinating flies is a function mostly of smell. flies are attracted by rotting flesh and carrions. the putrid odor seems to be the major attractant. the polyamines putrescine and cadaverine, which are the products of protein breakdown after animal death, are the source of the pungent smell of decaying meat. some plants strategically attract flies by synthesizing polyamines similar to those generated by decaying flesh and thereby attract carrion flies. flies seek out dead animals because they normally lay their eggs on them and their maggots feed on the decaying flesh. interestingly, time of death can be determined by a forensic entomologist based on the stages and type of maggots recovered from cadavers. hypothesis: because flies are drawn to other organisms based on smell and not sight, a flower that is normally attractive to bees because of its colors will attract flies if it is sprayed with polyamines similar to those generated by decaying flesh. test the hypothesis: select flowers usually pollinated by bees. white petunia may be good choice. divide the flowers into two groups, and while wearing eye protection and gloves, spray one group with a solution of either putrescine or cadaverine. (putrescine dihydrochloride is typically available in 98 percent concentration; this can be diluted to approximately 50 percent for this experiment.) place the flowers in a location where flies are present, keeping the sprayed and unsprayed flowers separated. observe the movement of the flies for one hour. record the number of visits to the flowers using a table similar to [link]. given the rapid movement of flies, it may be beneficial to use a video camera to record the flyflower interaction. replay the video in slow motion to obtain an accurate record of the number of fly visits to the flowers. repeat the experiment four more times with the same species of flower, but using different specimens. repeat the entire experiment with a different type of flower that is normally pollinated by bees.  analyze your data: review the data you have recorded. average the number of visits that flies made to sprayed flowers over the course of the five trials (on the first flower type) and compare and contrast them to the average number of visits that flies made to the unsprayed/control flowers. can you draw any conclusions regarding the attraction of the flies to the sprayed flowers? for the second flower type used, average the number of visits that flies made to sprayed flowers over the course of the five trials and compare and contrast them to the average number of visits that flies made to the unsprayed/control flowers. can you draw any conclusions regarding the attraction of the flies to the sprayed flowers? compare and contrast the average number of visits that flies made to the two flower types. can you draw any conclusions about whether the appearance of the flower had any impact on the attraction of flies? did smell override any appearance differences, or were the flies attracted to one flower type more than another? form a conclusion: do the results support the hypothesis? if not, how can this be explained? seed plants are the foundation of human diets across the world ([link]). many societies eat almost exclusively vegetarian fare and depend solely on seed plants for their nutritional needs. a few crops (rice, wheat, and potatoes) dominate the agricultural landscape. many crops were developed during the agricultural revolution, when human societies made the transition from nomadic huntergatherers to horticulture and agriculture. cereals, rich in carbohydrates, provide the staple of many human diets. beans and nuts supply proteins. fats are derived from crushed seeds, as is the case for peanut and rapeseed (canola) oils, or fruits such as olives. animal husbandry also consumes large amounts of crops. staple crops are not the only food derived from seed plants. fruits and vegetables provide nutrients, vitamins, and fiber. sugar, to sweeten dishes, is produced from the monocot sugarcane and the eudicot sugar beet. drinks are made from infusions of tea leaves, chamomile flowers, crushed coffee beans, or powdered cocoa beans. spices come from many different plant parts: saffron and cloves are stamens and buds, black pepper and vanilla are seeds, the bark of a bush in the laurales family supplies cinnamon, and the herbs that flavor many dishes come from dried leaves and fruit, such as the pungent red chili pepper. the volatile oils of flowers and bark provide the scent of perfumes. additionally, no discussion of seed plant contribution to human diet would be complete without the mention of alcohol. fermentation of plant-derived sugars and starches is used to produce alcoholic beverages in all societies. in some cases, the beverages are derived from the fermentation of sugars from fruit, as with wines and, in other cases, from the fermentation of carbohydrates derived from seeds, as with beers. seed plants have many other uses, including providing wood as a source of timber for construction, fuel, and material to build furniture. most paper is derived from the pulp of coniferous trees. fibers of seed plants such as cotton, flax, and hemp are woven into cloth. textile dyes, such as indigo, were mostly of plant origin until the advent of synthetic chemical dyes. lastly, it is more difficult to quantify the benefits of ornamental seed plants. these grace private and public spaces, adding beauty and serenity to human lives and inspiring painters and poets alike. the medicinal properties of plants have been known to human societies since ancient times. there are references to the use of plants curative properties in egyptian, babylonian, and chinese writings from 5,000 years ago. many modern synthetic therapeutic drugs are derived or synthesized de novo from plant secondary metabolites. it is important to note that the same plant extract can be a therapeutic remedy at low concentrations, become an addictive drug at higher doses, and can potentially kill at high concentrations. [link] presents a few drugs, their plants of origin, and their medicinal applications. ethnobotanistthe relatively new field of ethnobotany studies the interaction between a particular culture and the plants native to the region. seed plants have a large influence on day-to-day human life. not only are plants the major source of food and medicine, they also influence many other aspects of society, from clothing to industry. the medicinal properties of plants were recognized early on in human cultures. from the mid-1900s, synthetic chemicals began to supplant plant-based remedies. pharmacognosy is the branch of pharmacology that focuses on medicines derived from natural sources. with massive globalization and industrialization, there is a concern that much human knowledge of plants and their medicinal purposes will disappear with the cultures that fostered them. this is where ethnobotanists come in. to learn about and understand the use of plants in a particular culture, an ethnobotanist must bring in knowledge of plant life and an understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures and traditions. the amazon forest is home to an incredible diversity of vegetation and is considered an untapped resource of medicinal plants; yet, both the ecosystem and its indigenous cultures are threatened with extinction. to become an ethnobotanist, a person must acquire a broad knowledge of plant biology, ecology and sociology. not only are the plant specimens studied and collected, but also the stories, recipes, and traditions that are linked to them. for ethnobotanists, plants are not viewed solely as biological organisms to be studied in a laboratory, but as an integral part of human culture. the convergence of molecular biology, anthropology, and ecology make the field of ethnobotany a truly multidisciplinary science. biodiversity ensures a resource for new food crops and medicines. plant life balances ecosystems, protects watersheds, mitigates erosion, moderates climate and provides shelter for many animal species. threats to plant diversity, however, come from many angles. the explosion of the human population, especially in tropical countries where birth rates are highest and economic development is in full swing, is leading to human encroachment into forested areas. to feed the larger population, humans need to obtain arable land, so there is massive clearing of trees. the need for more energy to power larger cities and economic growth therein leads to the construction of dams, the consequent flooding of ecosystems, and increased emissions of pollutants. other threats to tropical forests come from poachers, who log trees for their precious wood. ebony and brazilian rosewood, both on the endangered list, are examples of tree species driven almost to extinction by indiscriminate logging. the number of plant species becoming extinct is increasing at an alarming rate. because ecosystems are in a delicate balance, and seed plants maintain close symbiotic relationships with animalswhether predators or pollinatorsthe disappearance of a single plant can lead to the extinction of connected animal species. a real and pressing issue is that many plant species have not yet been catalogued, and so their place in the ecosystem is unknown. these unknown species are threatened by logging, habitat destruction, and loss of pollinators. they may become extinct before we have the chance to begin to understand the possible impacts from their disappearance. efforts to preserve biodiversity take several lines of action, from preserving heirloom seeds to barcoding species. heirloom seeds come from plants that were traditionally grown in human populations, as opposed to the seeds used for large-scale agricultural production. barcoding is a technique in which one or more short gene sequences, taken from a well-characterized portion of the genome, are used to identify a species through dna analysis. angiosperm diversity is due in part to multiple interactions with animals. herbivory has favored the development of defense mechanisms in plants, and avoidance of those defense mechanism in animals. pollination (the transfer of pollen to a carpel) is mainly carried out by wind and animals, and angiosperms have evolved numerous adaptations to capture the wind or attract specific classes of animals. plants play a key role in ecosystems. they are a source of food and medicinal compounds, and provide raw materials for many industries. rapid deforestation and industrialization, however, threaten plant biodiversity. in turn, this threatens the ecosystem.","[('nectar', 'nectars'), ('deforestation', 'deforestations'), ('plant biodiversity', 'plant biodiversities'), ('pollination', 'pollinations'), ('heirloom plant', 'heirloom plants'), ('barcoding', 'barcodings'), ('spice', 'spices'), ('industrial plant use', 'industrial plant uses', 'industrial plants use', 'industrial plants uses'), ('herb', 'herbs'), ('heirloom seed', 'heirloom seeds'), ('plant animal interaction', 'plant animal interactions', 'plant animals interaction', 'plant animals interactions', 'plants animal interaction', 'plants animal interactions', 'plants animals interaction', 'plants animals interactions'), ('ethnobotanist', 'ethnobotanists'), ('biodiversity', 'biodiversities'), ('seed plant', 'seed plants'), ('crop', 'crops'), ('herbivory', 'herbivories')]"
135,stax-bio,27,Introduction to Animal Diversity,0,m44654,Introduction,"animal evolution began in the ocean over 600 million years ago with tiny creatures that probably do not resemble any living organism today. since then, animals have evolved into a highly diverse kingdom. although over one million extant (currently living) species of animals have been identified, scientists are continually discovering more species as they explore ecosystems around the world. the number of extant species is estimated to be between 3 and 30 million. but what is an animal? while we can easily identify dogs, birds, fish, spiders, and worms as animals, other organisms, such as corals and sponges, are not as easy to classify. animals vary in complexityfrom sea sponges to crickets to chimpanzeesand scientists are faced with the difficult task of classifying them within a unified system. they must identify traits that are common to all animals as well as traits that can be used to distinguish among related groups of animals. the animal classification system characterizes animals based on their anatomy, morphology, evolutionary history, features of embryological development, and genetic makeup. this classification scheme is constantly developing as new information about species arises. understanding and classifying the great variety of living species help us better understand how to conserve the diversity of life on earth.","[('eumatozoon', 'eumatozoas', 'eumatozoa'), ('cambrian explosion', 'cambrian explosions'), ('animal evolution', 'animal evolutions'), ('coelomate', 'coelomates'), ('kingdom animalium', 'kingdom animalias', 'kingdom animalia'), ('cryogenian period', 'cryogenian periods'), ('animal reproduction', 'animal reproductions'), ('animal characteristic', 'animal characteristics'), ('metazoon', 'metazoas', 'metazoa'), ('complex tissue structure', 'complex tissue structures', 'complex tissues structure', 'complex tissues structures'), ('eucoelomate', 'eucoelomates'), ('post-cambrian', 'post-cambrians'), ('evolution', 'evolutions'), ('coelom', 'coeloms'), ('paleontologist', 'paleontologists'), ('animal classification', 'animal classifications'), ('hox gene', 'hox genes'), ('radial symmetry', 'radial symmetries'), ('embryological development', 'embryological developments'), ('spiral cleavage', 'spiral cleavages'), ('diploblast', 'diploblasts'), ('tissue structure', 'tissue structures'), ('bilateral symmetry', 'bilateral symmetries'), ('protostome', 'protostomes'), ('body symmetry', 'body symmetries'), ('mas extinction', 'mas extinctions'), ('blastula', 'blastulas'), ('triplobast', 'triplobasts'), ('extinction', 'extinctions'), ('sexual development', 'sexual developments'), ('acoelomate', 'acoelomates'), ('indeterminate cleavage', 'indeterminate cleavages'), ('schizocoely', 'schizocoelies'), ('coelom evolution', 'coelom evolutions'), ('homeobox gene', 'homeobox genes'), ('animal diversity', 'animal diversities'), ('animal development', 'animal developments'), ('pre-cambrian', 'pre-cambrians'), ('parazoon', 'parazoas', 'parazoa'), ('ediacaran period', 'ediacaran periods'), ('cambrian period', 'cambrian periods'), ('enterocoely', 'enterocoelies'), ('pseudocoelomate', 'pseudocoelomates'), ('metazoan phylogenetic tree', 'metazoan phylogenetic trees', 'metazoans phylogenetic tree', 'metazoans phylogenetic trees'), ('blastopore', 'blastopores'), ('organogenesi', 'organogeneses', 'organogenesis'), ('gastrula', 'gastrulas'), ('animal kingdom', 'animal kingdoms'), ('cleavage', 'cleavages'), ('embryonic development', 'embryonic developments'), ('animal phylogeny', 'animal phylogenies'), ('radial cleavage', 'radial cleavages'), ('germ layer', 'germ layers'), ('deuterostome', 'deuterostomes'), ('determinate cleavage', 'determinate cleavages'), ('body plan', 'body plans'), ('asexual reproduction', 'asexual reproductions')]"
136,stax-bio,27,Introduction to Animal Diversity,1,m44655,Features of the Animal Kingdom,"even though members of the animal kingdom are incredibly diverse, most animals share certain features that distinguish them from organisms in other kingdoms. all animals are eukaryotic, multicellular organisms, and almost all animals have a complex tissue structure with differentiated and specialized tissues. most animals are motile, at least during certain life stages. all animals require a source of food and are therefore heterotrophic, ingesting other living or dead organisms; this feature distinguishes them from autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, which synthesize their own nutrients through photosynthesis. as heterotrophs, animals may be carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, or parasites ([link]ab). most animals reproduce sexually, and the offspring pass through a series of developmental stages that establish a determined and fixed body plan. the body plan refers to the morphology of an animal, determined by developmental cues. as multicellular organisms, animals differ from plants and fungi because their cells dont have cell walls, their cells may be embedded in an extracellular matrix (such as bone, skin, or connective tissue), and their cells have unique structures for intercellular communication (such as gap junctions). in addition, animals possess unique tissues, absent in fungi and plants, which allow coordination (nerve tissue) of motility (muscle tissue). animals are also characterized by specialized connective tissues that provide structural support for cells and organs. this connective tissue constitutes the extracellular surroundings of cells and is made up of organic and inorganic materials. in vertebrates, bone tissue is a type of connective tissue that supports the entire body structure. the complex bodies and activities of vertebrates demand such supportive tissues. epithelial tissues cover, line, protect, and secrete. epithelial tissues include the epidermis of the integument, the lining of the digestive tract and trachea, and make up the ducts of the liver and glands of advanced animals. the animal kingdom is divided into parazoa (sponges) and eumetazoa (all other animals). as very simple animals, the organisms in group parazoa (beside animal) do not contain true specialized tissues; although they do possess specialized cells that perform different functions, those cells are not organized into tissues. these organisms are considered animals since they lack the ability to make their own food. animals with true tissues are in the group eumetazoa (true animals). when we think of animals, we usually think of eumetazoans, since most animals fall into this category. the different types of tissues in true animals are responsible for carrying out specific functions for the organism. this differentiation and specialization of tissues is part of what allows for such incredible animal diversity. for example, the evolution of nerve tissues and muscle tissues has resulted in animals unique ability to rapidly sense and respond to changes in their environment. this allows animals to survive in environments where they must compete with other species to meet their nutritional demands. most animals are diploid organisms, meaning that their body (somatic) cells are diploid and haploid reproductive (gamete) cells are produced through meiosis. some exceptions exist: for example, in bees, wasps, and ants, the male is haploid because it develops from unfertilized eggs. most animals undergo sexual reproduction: this fact distinguishes animals from fungi, protists, and bacteria, where asexual reproduction is common or exclusive. however, a few groups, such as cnidarians, flatworm, and roundworms, undergo asexual reproduction, although nearly all of those animals also have a sexual phase to their life cycle. during sexual reproduction, the haploid gametes of the male and female individuals of a species combine in a process called fertilization. typically, the small, motile male sperm fertilizes the much larger, sessile female egg. this process produces a diploid fertilized egg called a zygote. some animal speciesincluding sea stars and sea anemones, as well as some insects, reptiles, and fishare capable of asexual reproduction. the most common forms of asexual reproduction for stationary aquatic animals include budding and fragmentation, where part of a parent individual can separate and grow into a new individual. in contrast, a form of asexual reproduction found in certain insects and vertebrates is called parthenogenesis (or virgin beginning), where unfertilized eggs can develop into new male offspring. this type of parthenogenesis is called haplodiploidy. these types of asexual reproduction produce genetically identical offspring, which is disadvantageous from the perspective of evolutionary adaptability because of the potential buildup of deleterious mutations. however, for animals that are limited in their capacity to attract mates, asexual reproduction can ensure genetic propagation. after fertilization, a series of developmental stages occur during which primary germ layers are established and reorganize to form an embryo. during this process, animal tissues begin to specialize and organize into organs and organ systems, determining their future morphology and physiology. some animals, such as grasshoppers, undergo incomplete metamorphosis, in which the young resemble the adult. other animals, such as some insects, undergo complete metamorphosis where individuals enter one or more larval stages that may in differ in structure and function from the adult ([link]). for the latter, the young and the adult may have different diets, limiting competition for food between them. regardless of whether a species undergoes complete or incomplete metamorphosis, the series of developmental stages of the embryo remains largely the same for most members of the animal kingdom. the process of animal development begins with the cleavage, or series of mitotic cell divisions, of the zygote ([link]). three cell divisions transform the single-celled zygote into an eight-celled structure. after further cell division and rearrangement of existing cells, a 632-celled hollow structure called a blastula is formed. next, the blastula undergoes further cell division and cellular rearrangement during a process called gastrulation. this leads to the formation of the next developmental stage, the gastrula, in which the future digestive cavity is formed. different cell layers (called germ layers) are formed during gastrulation. these germ layers are programmed to develop into certain tissue types, organs, and organ systems during a process called organogenesis. since the early 19th century, scientists have observed that many animals, from the very simple to the complex, shared similar embryonic morphology and development. surprisingly, a human embryo and a frog embryo, at a certain stage of embryonic development, look remarkably alike. for a long time, scientists did not understand why so many animal species looked similar during embryonic development but were very different as adults. they wondered what dictated the developmental direction that a fly, mouse, frog, or human embryo would take. near the end of the 20th century, a particular class of genes was discovered that had this very job. these genes that determine animal structure are called homeotic genes, and they contain dna sequences called homeoboxes. the animal genes containing homeobox sequences are specifically referred to as hox genes. this family of genes is responsible for determining the general body plan, such as the number of body segments of an animal, the number and placement of appendages, and animal head-tail directionality. the first hox genes to be sequenced were those from the fruit fly (drosophila melanogaster). a single hox mutation in the fruit fly can result in an extra pair of wings or even appendages growing from the wrong body part. while there are a great many genes that play roles in the morphological development of an animal, what makes hox genes so powerful is that they serve as master control genes that can turn on or off large numbers of other genes. hox genes do this by coding transcription factors that control the expression of numerous other genes. hox genes are homologous in the animal kingdom, that is, the genetic sequences of hox genes and their positions on chromosomes are remarkably similar across most animals because of their presence in a common ancestor, from worms to flies, mice, and humans ([link]). one of the contributions to increased animal body complexity is that hox genes have undergone at least two duplication events during animal evolution, with the additional genes allowing for more complex body types to evolve. animals constitute an incredibly diverse kingdom of organisms. although animals range in complexity from simple sea sponges to human beings, most members of the animal kingdom share certain features. animals are eukaryotic, multicellular, heterotrophic organisms that ingest their food and usually develop into motile creatures with a fixed body plan. a major characteristic unique to the animal kingdom is the presence of differentiated tissues, such as nerve, muscle, and connective tissues, which are specialized to perform specific functions. most animals undergo sexual reproduction, leading to a series of developmental embryonic stages that are relatively similar across the animal kingdom. a class of transcriptional control genes called hox genes directs the organization of the major animal body plans, and these genes are strongly homologous across the animal kingdom.","[('homeobox gene', 'homeobox genes'), ('sexual development', 'sexual developments'), ('organogenesi', 'organogeneses',

137,stax-bio,27,Introduction to Animal Diversity,2,m44656,Features Used to Classify Animals,"scientists have developed a classification scheme that categorizes all members of the animal kingdom, although there are exceptions to most rules governing animal classification ([link]). animals are primarily classified according to morphological and developmental characteristics, such as a body plan. one of the most prominent features of the body plan of true animals is that they are morphologically symmetrical. this means that their distribution of body parts is balanced along an axis. additional characteristics include the number of tissue layers formed during development, the presence or absence of an internal body cavity, and other features of embryological development, such as the origin of the mouth and anus. at a very basic level of classification, true animals can be largely divided into three groups based on the type of symmetry of their body plan: radially symmetrical, bilaterally symmetrical, and asymmetrical. asymmetry is a unique feature of parazoa ([link]a). only a few animal groups display radial symmetry. all types of symmetry are well suited to meet the unique demands of a particular animals lifestyle. radial symmetry is the arrangement of body parts around a central axis, as is seen in a drinking glass or pie. it results in animals having top and bottom surfaces but no left and right sides, or front or back. the two halves of a radially symmetrical animal may be described as the side with a mouth or oral side, and the side without a mouth (the aboral side). this form of symmetry marks the body plans of animals in the phyla ctenophora and cnidaria, including jellyfish and adult sea anemones ([link]bc). radial symmetry equips these sea creatures (which may be sedentary or only capable of slow movement or floating) to experience the environment equally from all directions. bilateral symmetry involves the division of the animal through a sagittal plane, resulting in two mirror image, right and left halves, such as those of a butterfly ([link]d), crab, or human body. animals with bilateral symmetry have a head and tail (anterior vs. posterior), front and back (dorsal vs. ventral), and right and left sides ([link]). all true animals except those with radial symmetry are bilaterally symmetrical. the evolution of bilateral symmetry that allowed for the formation of anterior and posterior (head and tail) ends promoted a phenomenon called cephalization, which refers to the collection of an organized nervous system at the animals anterior end. in contrast to radial symmetry, which is best suited for stationary or limited-motion lifestyles, bilateral symmetry allows for streamlined and directional motion. in evolutionary terms, this simple form of symmetry promoted active mobility and increased sophistication of resource-seeking and predator-prey relationships. animals in the phylum echinodermata (such as sea stars, sand dollars, and sea urchins) display radial symmetry as adults, but their larval stages exhibit bilateral symmetry. this is termed secondary radial symmetry. they are believed to have evolved from bilaterally symmetrical animals; thus, they are classified as bilaterally symmetrical. watch this video to see a quick sketch of the different types of body symmetry.

 most animal species undergo a separation of tissues into germ layers during embryonic development. recall that these germ layers are formed during gastrulation, and that they are predetermined to develop into the animals specialized tissues and organs. animals develop either two or three embryonic germs layers ([link]). the animals that display radial symmetry develop two germ layers, an inner layer (endoderm) and an outer layer (ectoderm). these animals are called diploblasts. diploblasts have a non-living layer between the endoderm and ectoderm. more complex animals (those with bilateral symmetry) develop three tissue layers: an inner layer (endoderm), an outer layer (ectoderm), and a middle layer (mesoderm). animals with three tissue layers are called triploblasts. each of the three germ layers is programmed to give rise to particular body tissues and organs. the endoderm gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract (including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas), as well as to the lining of the trachea, bronchi, and lungs of the respiratory tract, along with a few other structures. the ectoderm develops into the outer epithelial covering of the body surface, the central nervous system, and a few other structures. the mesoderm is the third germ layer; it forms between the endoderm and ectoderm in triploblasts. this germ layer gives rise to all muscle tissues (including the cardiac tissues and muscles of the intestines), connective tissues such as the skeleton and blood cells, and most other visceral organs such as the kidneys and the spleen. further subdivision of animals with three germ layers (triploblasts) results in the separation of animals that may develop an internal body cavity derived from mesoderm, called a coelom, and those that do not. this epithelial cell-lined coelomic cavity represents a space, usually filled with fluid, which lies between the visceral organs and the body wall. it houses many organs such as the digestive system, kidneys, reproductive organs, and heart, and contains the circulatory system. in some animals, such as mammals, the part of the coelom called the pleural cavity provides space for the lungs to expand during breathing. the evolution of the coelom is associated with many functional advantages. primarily, the coelom provides cushioning and shock absorption for the major organ systems. organs housed within the coelom can grow and move freely, which promotes optimal organ development and placement. the coelom also provides space for the diffusion of gases and nutrients, as well as body flexibility, promoting improved animal motility. triploblasts that do not develop a coelom are called acoelomates, and their mesoderm region is completely filled with tissue, although they do still have a gut cavity. examples of acoelomates include animals in the phylum platyhelminthes, also known as flatworms. animals with a true coelom are called eucoelomates (or coelomates) ([link]). a true coelom arises entirely within the mesoderm germ layer and is lined by an epithelial membrane. this membrane also lines the organs within the coelom, connecting and holding them in position while allowing them some free motion. annelids, mollusks, arthropods, echinoderms, and chordates are all eucoelomates. a third group of triploblasts has a slightly different coelom derived partly from mesoderm and partly from endoderm, which is found between the two layers. although still functional, these are considered false coeloms, and those animals are called pseudocoelomates. the phylum nematoda (roundworms) is an example of a pseudocoelomate. true coelomates can be further characterized based on certain features of their early embryological development. bilaterally symmetrical, tribloblastic eucoelomates can be further divided into two groups based on differences in their early embryonic development. protostomes include arthropods, mollusks, and annelids. deuterostomes include more complex animals such as chordates but also some simple animals such as echinoderms. these two groups are separated based on which opening of the digestive cavity develops first: mouth or anus. the word protostome comes from the greek word meaning mouth first, and deuterostome originates from the word meaning mouth second (in this case, the anus develops first). the mouth or anus develops from a structure called the blastopore ([link]). the blastopore is the indentation formed during the initial stages of gastrulation. in later stages, a second opening forms, and these two openings will eventually give rise to the mouth and anus ([link]). it has long been believed that the blastopore develops into the mouth of protostomes, with the second opening developing into the anus; the opposite is true for deuterostomes. recent evidence has challenged this view of the development of the blastopore of protostomes, however, and the theory remains under debate. another distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the method of coelom formation, beginning from the gastrula stage. the coelom of most protostomes is formed through a process called schizocoely, meaning that during development, a solid mass of the mesoderm splits apart and forms the hollow opening of the coelom. deuterostomes differ in that their coelom forms through a process called enterocoely. here, the mesoderm develops as pouches that are pinched off from the endoderm tissue. these pouches eventually fuse to form the mesoderm, which then gives rise to the coelom.	 the earliest distinction between protostomes and deuterostomes is the type of cleavage undergone by the zygote. protostomes undergo spiral cleavage, meaning that the cells of one pole of the embryo are rotated, and thus misaligned, with respect to the cells of the opposite pole. this is due to the oblique angle of the cleavage. deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage, where the cleavage axes are either parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis, resulting in the alignment of the cells between the two poles. there is a second distinction between the types of cleavage in protostomes and deuterostomes. in addition to spiral cleavage, protostomes also undergo determinate cleavage. this means that even at this early stage, the developmental fate of each embryonic cell is already determined. a cell does not have the ability to develop into any cell type. in contrast, deuterostomes undergo indeterminate cleavage, in which cells are not yet pre-determined at this early stage to develop into specific cell types. these cells are referred to as undifferentiated cells. this characteristic of deuterostomes is reflected in the existence of familiar embryonic stem cells, which have the ability to develop into any cell type until their fate is programmed at a later developmental stage. the evolution of the coelomone of the first steps in the classification of animals is to examine the animals body. studying the body parts tells us not only the roles of the organs in question but also how the species may have evolved. one such structure that is used in classification of animals is the coelom. a coelom is a body cavity that forms during early embryonic development. the coelom allows for compartmentalization of the body parts, so that different organ systems can evolve and nutrient transport is possible. additionally, because the coelom is a fluid-filled cavity, it protects the organs from shock and compression. simple animals, such as worms and jellyfish, do not have a coelom. all vertebrates have a coelom that helped them evolve complex organ systems. animals that do not have a coelom are called acoelomates. flatworms and tapeworms are examples of acoelomates. they rely on passive diffusion for nutrient transport across their body. additionally, the internal organs of acoelomates are not protected from crushing. animals that have a true coelom are called eucoelomates; all vertebrates are eucoelomates. the coelom evolves from the mesoderm during embryogenesis. the abdominal cavity contains the stomach, liver, gall bladder, and other digestive organs. another category of invertebrates animals based on body cavity is pseudocoelomates. these animals have a pseudo-cavity that is not completely lined by mesoderm. examples include nematode parasites and small worms. these animals are thought to have evolved from coelomates and may have lost their ability to form a coelom through genetic mutations. thus, this step in early embryogenesisthe formation of the coelomhas had a large evolutionary impact on the various species of the animal kingdom. organisms in the animal kingdom are classified based on their body morphology and development. true animals are divided into those with radial versus bilateral symmetry. generally, the simpler and often non-motile animals display radial symmetry. animals with radial symmetry are also generally characterized by the development of two embryological germ layers, the endoderm and ectoderm, whereas animals with bilateral symmetry are generally characterized by the development of a third embryological germ layer, the mesoderm. animals with three germ layers, called triploblasts, are further characterized by the presence or absence of an internal body cavity called a coelom. the presence of a coelom affords many advantages, and animals with a coelom may be termed true coelomates or pseudocoelomates, depending on which tissue gives rise to the coelom. coelomates are further divided into one of two groups called protostomes and deuterostomes, based on a number of developmental characteristics, including differences in zygote cleavage and method of coelom formation.","[('coelomate', 'coelomates'), ('animal characteristic', 'animal characteristics'), ('eucoelomate', 'eucoelomates'), ('coelom', 'coeloms'), ('animal classification', 'animal classifications'), ('protostome', 'protostomes'), ('radial symmetry', 'radial symmetries'), ('pseudocoelomate', 'pseudocoelomates'), ('diploblast', 'diploblasts'), ('bilateral symmetry', 'bilateral symmetries'), ('body symmetry', 'body symmetries'), ('acoelomate', 'acoelomates'), ('indeterminate cleavage', 'indeterminate cleavages'), ('schizocoely', 'schizocoelies'), ('coelom evolution', 'coelom evolutions'), ('animal diversity', 'animal diversities'), ('deuterostome', 'deuterostomes'), ('embryological development', 'embryological developments'), ('enterocoely', 'enterocoelies'), ('blastopore', 'blastopores'), ('radial cleavage', 'radial cleavages'), ('triplobast', 'triplobasts'), ('determinate cleavage', 'determinate cleavages'), ('spiral cleavage', 'spiral cleavages')]"
138,stax-bio,27,Introduction to Animal Diversity,3,m44658,Animal Phylogeny,"biologists strive to understand the evolutionary history and relationships of members of the animal kingdom, and all of life, for that matter. the study of phylogeny aims to determine the evolutionary relationships between phyla. currently, most biologists divide the animal kingdom into 35 to 40 phyla. scientists develop phylogenetic trees, which serve as hypotheses about which species have evolved from which ancestors recall that until recently, only morphological characteristics and the fossil record were used to determine phylogenetic relationships among animals. scientific understanding of the distinctions and hierarchies between anatomical characteristics provided much of this knowledge. used alone, however, this information can be misleading. morphological characteristics may evolve multiple times, and independently, through evolutionary history. analogous characteristics may appear similar between animals, but their underlying evolution may be very different. with the advancement of molecular technologies, modern phylogenetics is now informed by genetic and molecular analyses, in addition to traditional morphological and fossil data. with a growing understanding of genetics, the animal evolutionary tree has changed substantially and continues to change as new dna and rna analyses are performed on additional animal species. the current understanding of evolutionary relationships between animal, or metazoa, phyla begins with the distinction between true animals with true differentiated tissues, called eumetazoa, and animal phyla that do not have true differentiated tissues (such as the sponges), called parazoa. both parazoa and eumetazoa evolved from a common ancestral organism that resembles the modern-day protists called choanoflagellates. these protist cells strongly resemble the sponge choanocyte cells today ([link]). eumetazoa are subdivided into radially symmetrical animals and bilaterally symmetrical animals, and are thus classified into clade bilateria or radiata, respectively. as mentioned earlier, the cnidarians and ctenophores are animal phyla with true radial symmetry. all other eumetazoa are members of the bilateria clade. the bilaterally symmetrical animals are further divided into deuterostomes (including chordates and echinoderms) and two distinct clades of protostomes (including ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans) ([link]ab). ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group: exoskeletal molting (termed ecdysis). lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features, each common to certain phyla within the clade. some lophotrochozoan phyla are characterized by a larval stage called trochophore larvae, and other phyla are characterized by the presence of a feeding structure called a lophophore. the phylogenetic groupings are continually being debated and refined by evolutionary biologists. each year, new evidence emerges that further alters the relationships described by a phylogenetic tree diagram. nucleic acid and protein analyses have greatly informed the modern phylogenetic animal tree. these data come from a variety of molecular sources, such as mitochondrial dna, nuclear dna, ribosomal rna (rrna), and certain cellular proteins. many evolutionary relationships in the modern tree have only recently been determined due to molecular evidence. for example, a previously classified group of animals called lophophorates, which included brachiopods and bryozoans, were long-thought to be primitive deuterostomes. extensive molecular analysis using rrna data found these animals to be protostomes, more closely related to annelids and mollusks. this discovery allowed for the distinction of the protostome clade, the lophotrochozoans. molecular data have also shed light on some differences within the lophotrochozoan group, and some scientists believe that the phyla platyhelminthes and rotifera within this group should actually belong to their own group of protostomes termed platyzoa. molecular research similar to the discoveries that brought about the distinction of the lophotrochozoan clade has also revealed a dramatic rearrangement of the relationships between mollusks, annelids, arthropods, and nematodes, and a new ecdysozoan clade was formed. due to morphological similarities in their segmented body types, annelids and arthropods were once thought to be closely related. however, molecular evidence has revealed that arthropods are actually more closely related to nematodes, now comprising the ecdysozoan clade, and annelids are more closely related to mollusks, brachiopods, and other phyla in the lophotrochozoan clade. these two clades now make up the protostomes. another change to former phylogenetic groupings because of molecular analyses includes the emergence of an entirely new phylum of worm called acoelomorpha. these acoel flatworms were long thought to belong to the phylum platyhelminthes because of their similar flatworm morphology. however, molecular analyses revealed this to be a false relationship and originally suggested that acoels represented living species of some of the earliest divergent bilaterians. more recent research into the acoelomorphs has called this hypothesis into question and suggested a closer relationship with deuterostomes. the placement of this new phylum remains disputed, but scientists agree that with sufficient molecular data, their true phylogeny will be determined. scientists are interested in the evolutionary history of animals and the evolutionary relationships among them. there are three main sources of data that scientists use to create phylogenetic evolutionary tree diagrams that illustrate such relationships: morphological information (which includes developmental morphologies), fossil record data, and, most recently, molecular data. the details of the modern phylogenetic tree change frequently as new data are gathered, and molecular data has recently contributed to many substantial modifications of the understanding of relationships between animal phyla.","[('eumatozoon', 'eumatozoas', 'eumatozoa'), ('metazoan phylogenetic tree', 'metazoan phylogenetic trees', 'metazoans phylogenetic tree', 'metazoans phylogenetic trees'), ('metazoon', 'metazoas', 'metazoa'), ('animal diversity', 'animal diversities'), ('parazoon', 'parazoas', 'parazoa'), ('animal phylogeny', 'animal phylogenies')]"
139,stax-bio,27,Introduction to Animal Diversity,4,m44660,The Evolutionary History of the Animal Kingdom,"many questions regarding the origins and evolutionary history of the animal kingdom continue to be researched and debated, as new fossil and molecular evidence change prevailing theories. some of these questions include the following: how long have animals existed on earth? what were the earliest members of the animal kingdom, and what organism was their common ancestor? while animal diversity increased during the cambrian period of the paleozoic era, 530 million years ago, modern fossil evidence suggests that primitive animal species existed much earlier. the time before the cambrian period is known as the ediacaran period (from about 635 million years ago to 543 million years ago), the final period of the late proterozoic neoproterozoic era ([link]). it is believed that early animal life, termed ediacaran biota, evolved from protists at this time. some protist species called choanoflagellates closely resemble the choanocyte cells in the simplest animals, sponges. in addition to their morphological similarity, molecular analyses have revealed similar sequence homologies in their dna. the earliest life comprising ediacaran biota was long believed to include only tiny, sessile, soft-bodied sea creatures. however, recently there has been increasing scientific evidence suggesting that more varied and complex animal species lived during this time, and possibly even before the ediacaran period. fossils believed to represent the oldest animals with hard body parts were recently discovered in south australia. these sponge-like fossils, named coronacollina acula, date back as far as 560 million years, and are believed to show the existence of hard body parts and spicules that extended 2040 cm from the main body (estimated about 5 cm long). other fossils from the ediacaran period are shown in [link]ab. another recent fossil discovery may represent the earliest animal species ever found. while the validity of this claim is still under investigation, these primitive fossils appear to be small, one-centimeter long, sponge-like creatures. these fossils from south australia date back 650 million years, actually placing the putative animal before the great ice age extinction event that marked the transition between the cryogenian period and the ediacaran period. until this discovery, most scientists believed that there was no animal life prior to the ediacaran period. many scientists now believe that animals may in fact have evolved during the cryogenian period. the cambrian period, occurring between approximately 542488 million years ago, marks the most rapid evolution of new animal phyla and animal diversity in earths history. it is believed that most of the animal phyla in existence today had their origins during this time, often referred to as the cambrian explosion ([link]). echinoderms, mollusks, worms, arthropods, and chordates arose during this period. one of the most dominant species during the cambrian period was the trilobite, an arthropod that was among the first animals to exhibit a sense of vision ([link]abcd). the cause of the cambrian explosion is still debated. there are many theories that attempt to answer this question. environmental changes may have created a more suitable environment for animal life. examples of these changes include rising atmospheric oxygen levels and large increases in oceanic calcium concentrations that preceded the cambrian period ([link]). some scientists believe that an expansive, continental shelf with numerous shallow lagoons or pools provided the necessary living space for larger numbers of different types of animals to co-exist. there is also support for theories that argue that ecological relationships between species, such as changes in the food web, competition for food and space, and predator-prey relationships, were primed to promote a sudden massive coevolution of species. yet other theories claim genetic and developmental reasons for the cambrian explosion. the morphological flexibility and complexity of animal development afforded by the evolution of hox control genes may have provided the necessary opportunities for increases in possible animal morphologies at the time of the cambrian period. theories that attempt to explain why the cambrian explosion happened must be able to provide valid reasons for the massive animal diversification, as well as explain why it happened when it did. there is evidence that both supports and refutes each of the theories described above, and the answer may very well be a combination of these and other theories. however, unresolved questions about the animal diversification that took place during the cambrian period remain. for example, we do not understand how the evolution of so many species occurred in such a short period of time. was there really an explosion of life at this particular time? some scientists question the validity of the this idea, because there is increasing evidence to suggest that more animal life existed prior to the cambrian period and that other similar species so-called explosions (or radiations) occurred later in history as well. furthermore, the vast diversification of animal species that appears to have begun during the cambrian period continued well into the following ordovician period. despite some of these arguments, most scientists agree that the cambrian period marked a time of impressively rapid animal evolution and diversification that is unmatched elsewhere during history. view an animation of what ocean life may have been like during the cambrian explosion.

 the periods that followed the cambrian during the paleozoic era are marked by further animal evolution and the emergence of many new orders, families, and species. as animal phyla continued to diversify, new species adapted to new ecological niches. during the ordovician period, which followed the cambrian period, plant life first appeared on land. this change allowed formerly aquatic animal species to invade land, feeding directly on plants or decaying vegetation. continual changes in temperature and moisture throughout the remainder of the paleozoic era due to continental plate movements encouraged the development of new adaptations to terrestrial existence in animals, such as limbed appendages in amphibians and epidermal scales in reptiles. changes in the environment often create new niches (living spaces) that contribute to rapid speciation and increased diversity. on the other hand, cataclysmic events, such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life, can result in devastating losses of diversity. such periods of mass extinction ([link]) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life, erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind. the end of the permian period (and the paleozoic era) was marked by the largest mass extinction event in earths history, a loss of roughly 95 percent of the extant species at that time. some of the dominant phyla in the worlds oceans, such as the trilobites, disappeared completely. on land, the disappearance of some dominant species of permian reptiles made it possible for a new line of reptiles to emerge, the dinosaurs. the warm and stable climatic conditions of the ensuing mesozoic era promoted an explosive diversification of dinosaurs into every conceivable niche in land, air, and water. plants, too, radiated into new landscapes and empty niches, creating complex communities of producers and consumers, some of which became very large on the abundant food available. another mass extinction event occurred at the end of the cretaceous period, bringing the mesozoic era to an end. skies darkened and temperatures fell as a large meteor impact and tons of volcanic ash blocked incoming sunlight. plants died, herbivores and carnivores starved, and the mostly cold-blooded dinosaurs ceded their dominance of the landscape to more warm-blooded mammals. in the following cenozoic era, mammals radiated into terrestrial and aquatic niches once occupied by dinosaurs, and birds, the warm-blooded offshoots of one line of the ruling reptiles, became aerial specialists. the appearance and dominance of flowering plants in the cenozoic era created new niches for insects, as well as for birds and mammals. changes in animal species diversity during the late cretaceous and early cenozoic were also promoted by a dramatic shift in earths geography, as continental plates slid over the crust into their current positions, leaving some animal groups isolated on islands and continents, or separated by mountain ranges or inland seas from other competitors. early in the cenozoic, new ecosystems appeared, with the evolution of grasses and coral reefs. late in the cenozoic, further extinctions followed by speciation occurred during ice ages that covered high latitudes with ice and then retreated, leaving new open spaces for colonization. paleontologistnatural history museums contain the fossil casts of extinct animals and information about how these animals evolved, lived, and died. paleontogists are scientists who study prehistoric life. they use fossils to observe and explain how life evolved on earth and how species interacted with each other and with the environment. a paleontologist needs to be knowledgeable in biology, ecology, chemistry, geology, and many other scientific disciplines. a paleontologists work may involve field studies: searching for and studying fossils. in addition to digging for and finding fossils, paleontologists also prepare fossils for further study and analysis. although dinosaurs are probably the first animals that come to mind when thinking about paleontology, paleontologists study everything from plant life, fungi, and fish to sea animals and birds. an undergraduate degree in earth science or biology is a good place to start toward the career path of becoming a paleontologist. most often, a graduate degree is necessary. additionally, work experience in a museum or in a paleontology lab is useful. the most rapid diversification and evolution of animal species in all of history occurred during the cambrian period of the paleozoic era, a phenomenon known as the cambrian explosion. until recently, scientists believed that there were only very few tiny and simplistic animal species in existence before this period. however, recent fossil discoveries have revealed that additional, larger, and more complex animals existed during the ediacaran period, and even possibly earlier, during the cryogenian period. still, the cambrian period undoubtedly witnessed the emergence of the majority of animal phyla that we know today, although many questions remain unresolved about this historical phenomenon. the remainder of the paleozoic era is marked by the growing appearance of new classes, families, and species, and the early colonization of land by certain marine animals. the evolutionary history of animals is also marked by numerous major extinction events, each of which wiped out a majority of extant species. some species of most animal phyla survived these extinctions, allowing the phyla to persist and continue to evolve into species that we see today.","[('cambrian explosion', 'cambrian explosions'),

141,stax-bio,28,Invertebrates,1,m44663,Phylum Porifera,"the invertebrates, or invertebrata, are animals that do not contain bony structures, such as the cranium and vertebrae. the simplest of all the invertebrates are the parazoans, which include only the phylum porifera: the sponges ([link]). parazoans (beside animals) do not display tissue-level organization, although they do have specialized cells that perform specific functions. sponge larvae are able to swim; however, adults are non-motile and spend their life attached to a substratum. since water is vital to sponges for excretion, feeding, and gas exchange, their body structure facilitates the movement of water through the sponge. structures such as canals, chambers, and cavities enable water to move through the sponge to nearly all body cells. the morphology of the simplest sponges takes the shape of a cylinder with a large central cavity, the spongocoel, occupying the inside of the cylinder. water can enter into the spongocoel from numerous pores in the body wall. water entering the spongocoel is extruded via a large common opening called the osculum. however, sponges exhibit a range of diversity in body forms, including variations in the size of the spongocoel, the number of osculi, and where the cells that filter food from the water are located. while sponges (excluding the hexactinellids) do not exhibit tissue-layer organization, they do have different cell types that perform distinct functions. pinacocytes, which are epithelial-like cells, form the outermost layer of sponges and enclose a jelly-like substance called mesohyl. mesohyl is an extracellular matrix consisting of a collagen-like gel with suspended cells that perform various functions. the gel-like consistency of mesohyl acts like an endoskeleton and maintains the tubular morphology of sponges. in addition to the osculum, sponges have multiple pores called ostia on their bodies that allow water to enter the sponge. in some sponges, ostia are formed by porocytes, single tube-shaped cells that act as valves to regulate the flow of water into the spongocoel. in other sponges, ostia are formed by folds in the body wall of the sponge. choanocytes (collar cells) are present at various locations, depending on the type of sponge, but they always line the inner portions of some space through which water flows (the spongocoel in simple sponges, canals within the body wall in more complex sponges, and chambers scattered throughout the body in the most complex sponges). whereas pinacocytes line the outside of the sponge, choanocytes tend to line certain inner portions of the sponge body that surround the mesohyl. the structure of a choanocyte is critical to its function, which is to generate a water current through the sponge and to trap and ingest food particles by phagocytosis. note the similarity in appearance between the sponge choanocyte and choanoflagellates (protista). this similarity suggests that sponges and choanoflagellates are closely related and likely share a recent common ancestry. the cell body is embedded in mesohyl and contains all organelles required for normal cell function, but protruding into the open space inside of the sponge is a mesh-like collar composed of microvilli with a single flagellum in the center of the column. the cumulative effect of the flagella from all choanocytes aids the movement of water through the sponge: drawing water into the sponge through the numerous ostia, into the spaces lined by choanocytes, and eventually out through the osculum (or osculi). in the meantime, food particles, including waterborne bacteria and algae, are trapped by the sieve-like collar of the choanocytes, slide down into the body of the cell, are ingested by phagocytosis, and become encased in a food vacuole. lastly, choanocytes will differentiate into sperm for sexual reproduction, where they will become dislodged from the mesohyl and leave the sponge with expelled water through the osculum. the second crucial cells in sponges are called amoebocytes (or archaeocytes), named for the fact that they move throughout the mesohyl in an amoeba-like fashion. amoebocytes have a variety of functions: delivering nutrients from choanocytes to other cells within the sponge, giving rise to eggs for sexual reproduction (which remain in the mesohyl), delivering phagocytized sperm from choanocytes to eggs, and differentiating into more-specific cell types. some of these more-specific cell types include collencytes and lophocytes, which produce the collagen-like protein to maintain the mesohyl, sclerocytes, which produce spicules in some sponges, and spongocytes, which produce the protein spongin in the majority of sponges. these cells produce collagen to maintain the consistency of the mesohyl. the different cell types in sponges are shown in [link]. in some sponges, sclerocytes secrete small spicules into the mesohyl, which are composed of either calcium carbonate or silica, depending on the type of sponge. these spicules serve to provide additional stiffness to the body of the sponge. additionally, spicules, when present externally, may ward off predators. another type of protein, spongin, may also be present in the mesohyl of some sponges. the presence and composition of spicules/spongin are the differentiating characteristics of the three classes of sponges ([link]): class calcarea contains calcium carbonate spicules and no spongin, class hexactinellida contains six-rayed siliceous spicules and no spongin, and class demospongia contains spongin and may or may not have spicules; if present, those spicules are siliceous. spicules are most conspicuously present in class hexactinellida, the order consisting of glass sponges. some of the spicules may attain giant proportions (in relation to the typical size range of glass sponges of 3 to 10 mm) as seen in monorhaphis chuni, which grows up to 3 m long. use the interactive sponge guide to identify species of sponges based on their external form, mineral skeleton, fiber, and skeletal architecture. sponges, despite being simple organisms, regulate their different physiological processes through a variety of mechanisms. these processes regulate their metabolism, reproduction, and locomotion. sponges lack complex digestive, respiratory, circulatory, reproductive, and nervous systems. their food is trapped when water passes through the ostia and out through the osculum. bacteria smaller than 0.5 microns in size are trapped by choanocytes, which are the principal cells engaged in nutrition, and are ingested by phagocytosis. particles that are larger than the ostia may be phagocytized by pinacocytes. in some sponges, amoebocytes transport food from cells that have ingested food particles to those that do not. for this type of digestion, in which food particles are digested within individual cells, the sponge draws water through diffusion. the limit of this type of digestion is that food particles must be smaller than individual cells. all other major body functions in the sponge (gas exchange, circulation, excretion) are performed by diffusion between the cells that line the openings within the sponge and the water that is passing through those openings. all cell types within the sponge obtain oxygen from water through diffusion. likewise, carbon dioxide is released into seawater by diffusion. in addition, nitrogenous waste produced as a byproduct of protein metabolism is excreted via diffusion by individual cells into the water as it passes through the sponge. sponges reproduce by sexual as well as asexual methods. the typical means of asexual reproduction is either fragmentation (where a piece of the sponge breaks off, settles on a new substrate, and develops into a new individual) or budding (a genetically identical outgrowth grows from the parent and eventually detaches or remains attached to form a colony). an atypical type of asexual reproduction is found only in freshwater sponges and occurs through the formation of gemmules. gemmules are environmentally resistant structures produced by adult sponges wherein the typical sponge morphology is inverted. in gemmules, an inner layer of amoebocytes is surrounded by a layer of collagen (spongin) that may be reinforced by spicules. the collagen that is normally found in the mesohyl becomes the outer protective layer. in freshwater sponges, gemmules may survive hostile environmental conditions like changes in temperature and serve to recolonize the habitat once environmental conditions stabilize. gemmules are capable of attaching to a substratum and generating a new sponge. since gemmules can withstand harsh environments, are resistant to desiccation, and remain dormant for long periods, they are an excellent means of colonization for a sessile organism. sexual reproduction in sponges occurs when gametes are generated. sponges are monoecious (hermaphroditic), which means that one individual can produce both gametes (eggs and sperm) simultaneously. in some sponges, production of gametes may occur throughout the year, whereas other sponges may show sexual cycles depending upon water temperature. sponges may also become sequentially hermaphroditic, producing oocytes first and spermatozoa later. oocytes arise by the differentiation of amoebocytes and are retained within the spongocoel, whereas spermatozoa result from the differentiation of choanocytes and are ejected via the osculum. ejection of spermatozoa may be a timed and coordinated event, as seen in certain species. spermatozoa carried along by water currents can fertilize the oocytes borne in the mesohyl of other sponges. early larval development occurs within the sponge, and free-swimming larvae are then released via the osculum. sponges are generally sessile as adults and spend their lives attached to a fixed substratum. they do not show movement over large distances like other free-swimming marine invertebrates. however, sponge cells are capable of creeping along substrata via organizational plasticity. under experimental conditions, researchers have shown that sponge cells spread on a physical support demonstrate a leading edge for directed movement. it has been speculated that this localized creeping movement may help sponges adjust to microenvironments near the point of attachment. it must be noted, however, that this pattern of movement has been documented in laboratories, but it remains to be observed in natural sponge habitats. animals included in phylum porifera are parazoans because they do not show the formation of true tissues (except in class hexactinellida). these organisms show very simple organization, with a rudimentary endoskeleton. sponges have multiple cell types that are geared toward executing various metabolic functions. although these animals are very simple, they perform several complex physiological functions.","[('invertebrate', 'invertebrates'), ('sponge locomotion', 'sponge locomotions'), ('mesohyl', 'mesohyls'), ('porifera', 'poriferas'), ('sponge reproduction', 'sponge

142,stax-bio,28,Invertebrates,2,m44664,Phylum Cnidaria,"phylum cnidaria includes animals that show radial or biradial symmetry and are diploblastic, that is, they develop from two embryonic layers. nearly all (about 99 percent) cnidarians are marine species. cnidarians contain specialized cells known as cnidocytes (stinging cells) containing organelles called nematocysts (stingers). these cells are present around the mouth and tentacles, and serve to immobilize prey with toxins contained within the cells. nematocysts contain coiled threads that may bear barbs. the outer wall of the cell has hairlike projections called cnidocils, which are sensitive to touch. when touched, the cells are known to fire coiled threads that can either penetrate the flesh of the prey or predators of cnidarians (see [link]) or ensnare it. these coiled threads release toxins into the target and can often immobilize prey or scare away predators. view this video animation showing two anemones engaged in a battle.


 animals in this phylum display two distinct morphological body plans: polyp or stalk and medusa or bell ([link]). an example of the polyp form is hydra spp.; perhaps the most well-known medusoid animals are the jellies (jellyfish). polyp forms are sessile as adults, with a single opening to the digestive system (the mouth) facing up with tentacles surrounding it. medusa forms are motile, with the mouth and tentacles hanging down from an umbrella-shaped bell. some cnidarians are polymorphic, that is, they have two body plans during their life cycle. an example is the colonial hydroid called an obelia. the sessile polyp form has, in fact, two types of polyps, shown in [link]. the first is the gastrozooid, which is adapted for capturing prey and feeding; the other type of polyp is the gonozooid, adapted for the asexual budding of medusa. when the reproductive buds mature, they break off and become free-swimming medusa, which are either male or female (dioecious). the male medusa makes sperm, whereas the female medusa makes eggs. after fertilization, the zygote develops into a blastula, which develops into a planula larva. the larva is free swimming for a while, but eventually attaches and a new colonial reproductive polyp is formed. all cnidarians show the presence of two membrane layers in the body that are derived from the endoderm and ectoderm of the embryo. the outer layer (from ectoderm) is called the epidermis and lines the outside of the animal, whereas the inner layer (from endoderm) is called the gastrodermis and lines the digestive cavity. between these two membrane layers is a non-living, jelly-like mesoglea connective layer. in terms of cellular complexity, cnidarians show the presence of differentiated cell types in each tissue layer, such as nerve cells, contractile epithelial cells, enzyme-secreting cells, and nutrient-absorbing cells, as well as the presence of intercellular connections. however, the development of organs or organ systems is not advanced in this phylum. the nervous system is primitive, with nerve cells scattered across the body. this nerve net may show the presence of groups of cells in the form of nerve plexi (singular plexus) or nerve cords. the nerve cells show mixed characteristics of motor as well as sensory neurons. the predominant signaling molecules in these primitive nervous systems are chemical peptides, which perform both excitatory and inhibitory functions. despite the simplicity of the nervous system, it coordinates the movement of tentacles, the drawing of captured prey to the mouth, the digestion of food, and the expulsion of waste. the cnidarians perform extracellular digestion in which the food is taken into the gastrovascular cavity, enzymes are secreted into the cavity, and the cells lining the cavity absorb nutrients. the gastrovascular cavity has only one opening that serves as both a mouth and an anus, which is termed an incomplete digestive system. cnidarian cells exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion between cells in the epidermis with water in the environment, and between cells in the gastrodermis with water in the gastrovascular cavity. the lack of a circulatory system to move dissolved gases limits the thickness of the body wall and necessitates a non-living mesoglea between the layers. there is no excretory system or organs, and nitrogenous wastes simply diffuse from the cells into the water outside the animal or in the gastrovascular cavity. there is also no circulatory system, so nutrients must move from the cells that absorb them in the lining of the gastrovascular cavity through the mesoglea to other cells. the phylum cnidaria contains about 10,000 described species divided into four classes: anthozoa, scyphozoa, cubozoa, and hydrozoa. the anthozoans, the sea anemones and corals, are all sessile species, whereas the scyphozoans (jellyfish) and cubozoans (box jellies) are swimming forms. the hydrozoans contain sessile forms and swimming colonial forms like the portuguese man o war. the class anthozoa includes all cnidarians that exhibit a polyp body plan only; in other words, there is no medusa stage within their life cycle. examples include sea anemones ([link]), sea pens, and corals, with an estimated number of 6,100 described species. sea anemones are usually brightly colored and can attain a size of 1.8 to 10 cm in diameter. these animals are usually cylindrical in shape and are attached to a substrate. a mouth opening is surrounded by tentacles bearing cnidocytes. the mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. the slit-like mouth opening and pharynx are lined by a groove called a siphonophore. the pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food, and may extend for up to two-thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity. this cavity is divided into several chambers by longitudinal septa called mesenteries. each mesentery consists of one ectodermal and one endodermal cell layer with the mesoglea sandwiched in between. mesenteries do not divide the gastrovascular cavity completely, and the smaller cavities coalesce at the pharyngeal opening. the adaptive benefit of the mesenteries appears to be an increase in surface area for absorption of nutrients and gas exchange. sea anemones feed on small fish and shrimp, usually by immobilizing their prey using the cnidocytes. some sea anemones establish a mutualistic relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crabs shell. in this relationship, the anemone gets food particles from prey caught by the crab, and the crab is protected from the predators by the stinging cells of the anemone. anemone fish, or clownfish, are able to live in the anemone since they are immune to the toxins contained within the nematocysts. anthozoans remain polypoid throughout their lives and can reproduce asexually by budding or fragmentation, or sexually by producing gametes. both gametes are produced by the polyp, which can fuse to give rise to a free-swimming planula larva. the larva settles on a suitable substratum and develops into a sessile polyp. class scyphozoa includes all the jellies and is exclusively a marine class of animals with about 200 known species. the defining characteristic of this class is that the medusa is the prominent stage in the life cycle, although there is a polyp stage present. members of this species range from 2 to 40 cm in length but the largest scyphozoan species, cyanea capillata, can reach a size of 2 m across. scyphozoans display a characteristic bell-like morphology ([link]). in the jellyfish, a mouth opening is present on the underside of the animal, surrounded by tentacles bearing nematocysts. scyphozoans live most of their life cycle as free-swimming, solitary carnivores. the mouth leads to the gastrovascular cavity, which may be sectioned into four interconnected sacs, called diverticuli. in some species, the digestive system may be further branched into radial canals. like the septa in anthozoans, the branched gastrovascular cells serve two functions: to increase the surface area for nutrient absorption and diffusion; thus, more cells are in direct contact with the nutrients in the gastrovascular cavity. in scyphozoans, nerve cells are scattered all over the body. neurons may even be present in clusters called rhopalia. these animals possess a ring of muscles lining the dome of the body, which provides the contractile force required to swim through water. scyphozoans are dioecious animals, that is, the sexes are separate. the gonads are formed from the gastrodermis and gametes are expelled through the mouth. planula larvae are formed by external fertilization; they settle on a substratum in a polypoid form known as scyphistoma. these forms may produce additional polyps by budding or may transform into the medusoid form. the life cycle ([link]) of these animals can be described as polymorphic, because they exhibit both a medusal and polypoid body plan at some point in their life cycle. this class includes jellies that have a box-shaped medusa, or a bell that is square in cross-section; hence, are colloquially known as box jellyfish. these species may achieve sizes of 1525 cm. cubozoans display overall morphological and anatomical characteristics that are similar to those of the scyphozoans. a prominent difference between the two classes is the arrangement of tentacles. this is the most venomous group of all the cnidarians ([link]). the cubozoans contain muscular pads called pedalia at the corners of the square bell canopy, with one or more tentacles attached to each pedalium. these animals are further classified into orders based on the presence of single or multiple tentacles per pedalium. in some cases, the digestive system may extend into the pedalia. nematocysts may be arranged in a spiral configuration along the tentacles; this arrangement helps to effectively subdue and capture prey. cubozoans exist in a polypoid form that develops from a planula larva. these polyps show limited mobility along the substratum and, like scyphozoans, may bud to form more polyps to colonize a habitat. polyp forms then transform into the medusoid forms. hydrozoa includes nearly 3,200 species; most are marine, although some freshwater species are known ([link]). animals in this class are polymorphs, and most exhibit both polypoid and medusoid forms in their lifecycle, although this is variable. the polyp form in these animals often shows a cylindrical morphology with a central gastrovascular cavity lined by the gastrodermis. the gastrodermis and epidermis have a simple layer of mesoglea sandwiched between them. a mouth opening, surrounded by tentacles, is present at the oral end of the animal. many hydrozoans form colonies that are composed of a branched colony of specialized polyps that share a gastrovascular cavity, such as in the colonial hydroid obelia. colonies may also be free-floating and contain medusoid and polypoid individuals in the colony as in physalia (the portuguese man o war) or velella (by-the-wind sailor). even other species are solitary polyps (hydra) or solitary medusae (gonionemus). the true characteristic shared by all of these diverse species is that their gonads for sexual reproduction are derived from epidermal tissue, whereas in all other cnidarians they are derived from gastrodermal tissue. cnidarians represent a more complex level of organization than porifera. they possess outer and inner tissue layers that sandwich a noncellular mesoglea. cnidarians possess a well-formed digestive system and carry out extracellular digestion. the cnidocyte is a specialized cell for delivering toxins to prey as well as warning off predators. cnidarians have separate sexes and have a lifecycle that involves morphologically distinct forms. these animals also show two distinct morphological formsmedusoid and polypoidat various stages in their lifecycle.","[('cubozoon', 'cubozoas', 'cubozoa'), ('invertebrate', 'invertebrates'), ('phylum cnidarium', 'phylum cnidarias', 'phylum cnidaria'), ('medusa', 'medusae'), ('anthozoon', 'anthozoas', 'anthozoa'), ('cnidarian', 'cnidarians'), ('cnidarium', 'cnidarias', 'cnidaria'), ('hydrozoon', 'hydrozoas', 'hydrozoa'), ('scyphozoon', 'scyphozoas', 'scyphozoa'), ('polyp', 'polyps'), ('coelenteron', 'coelenterons'), ('invertebratum', 'invertebratas', 'invertebrata'), ('cnidocyte', 'cnidocytes'), ('mesoglea', 'mesogleas'), ('nematocyst', 'nematocysts')]"
143,stax-bio,28,Invertebrates,3,m44665,Superphylum Lophotrochozoa,"animals belonging to superphylum lophotrochozoa are protostomes, in which the blastopore, or the point of involution of the ectoderm or outer germ layer, becomes the mouth opening to the alimentary canal. this is called protostomy or first mouth. in protostomy, solid groups of cells split from the endoderm or inner germ layer to form a central mesodermal layer of cells. this layer multiplies into a band and then splits internally to form the coelom; this protostomic coelom is hence termed schizocoelom. as lophotrochozoans, the organisms in this superphylum possess either a lophophore or trochophore larvae. the lophophores include groups that are united by the presence of the lophophore, a set of ciliated tentacles surrounding the mouth. lophophorata include the flatworms and several other phyla. these clades are upheld when rna sequences are compared. trochophore larvae are characterized by two bands of cilia around the body. the lophotrochozoans are triploblastic and possess an embryonic mesoderm sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm found in the diploblastic cnidarians. these phyla are also bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that a longitudinal section will divide them into right and left sides that are symmetrical. it also means the beginning of cephalization, the evolution of a concentration of nervous tissues and sensory organs in the head of the organism, which is where it first encounters its environment. the flatworms are acoelomate organisms that include many free-living and parasitic forms. most of the flatworms are classified in the superphylum lophotrochozoa, which also includes the mollusks and annelids. the platyhelminthes consist of two lineages: the catenulida and the rhabditophora. the catenulida, or ""chain worms"" is a small clade of just over 100 species. these worms typically reproduce asexually by budding. however, the offspring do not fully attach from the parents and, resemble a chain in appearance. all of the remaining flatworms discussed here are part of the rhabditophora. many flatworms are parasitic, including important parasites of humans. flatworms have three embryonic tissue layers that give rise to surfaces that cover tissues (from ectoderm), internal tissues (from mesoderm), and line the digestive system (from endoderm). the epidermal tissue is a single layer cells or a layer of fused cells (syncytium) that covers a layer of circular muscle above a layer of longitudinal muscle. the mesodermal tissues include mesenchymal cells that contain collagen and support secretory cells that secrete mucus and other materials at the surface. the flatworms are acoelomates, so their bodies are solid between the outer surface and the cavity of the digestive system. the free-living species of flatworms are predators or scavengers. parasitic forms feed on the tissues of their hosts. most flatworms, such as the planarian shown in [link], have a gastrovascular cavity rather than a complete digestive system. in such animals, the mouth is also used to expel waste materials from the digestive system. some species also have an anal opening. the gut may be a simple sac or highly branched. digestion is extracellular, with digested materials taken in to the cells of the gut lining by phagocytosis. one group, the cestodes, lacks a digestive system. flatworms have an excretory system with a network of tubules throughout the body with openings to the environment and nearby flame cells, whose cilia beat to direct waste fluids concentrated in the tubules out of the body. the system is responsible for the regulation of dissolved salts and the excretion of nitrogenous wastes. the nervous system consists of a pair of nerve cords running the length of the body with connections between them and a large ganglion or concentration of nerves at the anterior end of the worm, where there may also be a concentration of photosensory and chemosensory cells. there is neither a circulatory nor respiratory system, with gas and nutrient exchange dependent on diffusion and cell-cell junctions. this necessarily limits the thickness of the body in these organisms, constraining them to be flat worms. most flatworm species are monoecious, and fertilization is typically internal. asexual reproduction is common in some groups. platyhelminthes are traditionally divided into four classes: turbellaria, monogenea, trematoda, and cestoda ([link]). as discussed above, the relationships among members of these classes is being reassessed, with the turbellarians in particular now viewed as a paraphyletic group, a group that does not have a single common ancestor. the class turbellaria includes mainly free-living, marine species, although some species live in freshwater or moist terrestrial environments. the ventral epidermis of turbellarians is ciliated and facilitates their locomotion. some turbellarians are capable of remarkable feats of regeneration in which they may regrow the body, even from a small fragment. the monogeneans are ectoparasites, mostly of fish, with simple lifecycles that consist of a free-swimming larva that attaches to a fish to begin transformation to the parasitic adult form. the parasite has only one host and that host is usually only one species. the worms may produce enzymes that digest the host tissues or simply graze on surface mucus and skin particles. most monogeneans are hermaphroditic, but the male gametes develop first and so cross-fertilization is quite common. the trematodes, or flukes, are internal parasites of mollusks and many other groups, including humans. trematodes have complex lifecycles that involve a primary host in which sexual reproduction occurs, and one or more secondary hosts in which asexual reproduction occurs. the primary host is almost always a mollusk. trematodes are responsible for serious human diseases including schistosomiasis, a blood fluke. the disease infects an estimated 200 million people in the tropics, leading to organ damage and chronic symptoms like fatigue. infection occurs when the human enters the water and a larva, released from the primary snail host, locates and penetrates the skin. the parasite infects various organs in the body and feeds on red blood cells before reproducing. many of the eggs are released in feces and find their way into a waterway, where they are able to reinfect the primary snail host. the cestodes, or tapeworms, are also internal parasites, mainly of vertebrates ([link]). tapeworms live in the intestinal tract of the primary host and remain fixed using a sucker on the anterior end, or scolex, of the tapeworm body. the remaining body of the tapeworm is made up of a long series of units called proglottids, each of which may contain an excretory system with flame cells, but contain reproductive structures, both male and female. tapeworms do not possess a digestive system; instead, they absorb nutrients from the food matter passing them in the hosts intestine. proglottids are produced at the scolex and gradually migrate to the end of the tapeworm; at this point, they are mature and all structures except fertilized eggs have degenerated. most reproduction occurs by cross-fertilization. the proglottid detaches from the body of the worm and is released into the feces of the organism. the eggs are eaten by an intermediate host. the juvenile worm infects the intermediate host and takes up residence, usually in muscle tissue. when the muscle tissue is eaten by the primary host, the cycle is completed. there are several tapeworm parasites of humans that are transmitted by eating uncooked or poorly cooked pork, beef, and fish. the rotifers are a microscopic (about 100 m to 30 mm) group of mostly aquatic organisms that get their name from the corona, a rotating, wheel-like structure that is covered with cilia at their anterior end ([link]). although their taxonomy is currently in flux, one treatment places the rotifers in three classes: bdelloidea, monogononta, and seisonidea. the classification of the group is currently under revision, however, as more phylogenetic evidence becomes available. it is possible that the spiny headed worms currently in phylum acanthocephala will be incorporated into this group in the future. the body form of rotifers consists of a head (which contains the corona), a trunk (which contains the organs), and the foot. rotifers are typically free-swimming and truly planktonic organisms, but the toes or extensions of the foot can secrete a sticky material forming a holdfast to help them adhere to surfaces.  the head contains sensory organs in the form of a bi-lobed brain and small eyespots near the corona. the rotifers are filter feeders that will eat dead material, algae, and other microscopic living organisms, and are therefore very important components of aquatic food webs. rotifers obtain food that is directed toward the mouth by the current created from the movement of the corona. the food particles enter the mouth and travel to the mastax (pharynx with jaw-like structures). food then passes by digestive and salivary glands, and into the stomach, then onto the intestines. digestive and excretory wastes are collected in a cloacal bladder before being released out the anus. rotifers are pseudocoelomates commonly found in fresh water and some salt water environments throughout the world. [link] shows the anatomy of a rotifer belonging to class bdelloidea. about 2,200 species of rotifers have been identified. rotifers are dioecious organisms (having either male or female genitalia) and exhibit sexual dimorphism (males and females have different forms). many species are parthenogenic and exhibit haplodiploidy, a method of sex determination in which a fertilized egg develops into a female and an unfertilized egg develops into a male. in many dioecious species, males are short-lived and smaller with no digestive system and a single testis. females can produce eggs that are capable of dormancy for protection during harsh environmental conditions. the nemertea are colloquially known as ribbon worms. most species of phylum nemertea are marine, predominantly benthic or bottom dwellers, with an estimated 900 species known. however, nemertini have been recorded in freshwater and terrestrial habitats as well. most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on worms, clams, and crustaceans. some species are scavengers, and some nemertini species, like malacobdella grossa, have also evolved commensalistic relationships with some mollusks. some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. nemerteans have almost no predators and two species are sold as fish bait. ribbon worms vary in size from 1 cm to several meters. they show bilateral symmetry and remarkable contractile properties. because of their contractility, they can change their morphological presentation in response to environmental cues. animals in phylum nemertea show a flattened morphology, that is, they are flat from front to back, like a flattened tube. nemertea are soft and unsegmented animals ([link]). a unique characteristic of this phylum is the presence of a proboscis enclosed in a rhynchocoel. the proboscis serves to capture food and may be ornamented with barbs in some species. the rhynchocoel is a fluid-filled cavity that extends from the head to nearly two-thirds of the length of the gut in these animals ([link]). the proboscis may be extended or retracted by the retractor muscle attached to the wall of the rhynchocoel. watch this video to see a nemertean attack a polychaete with its proboscis.

 the nemertini show a very well-developed digestive system. a mouth opening that is ventral to the rhynchocoel leads into the foregut, followed by the intestine. the intestine is present in the form of diverticular pouches and ends in a rectum that opens via an anus. gonads are interspersed with the intestinal diverticular pouches and open outwards via genital pores. a circulatory system consists of a closed loop of a pair of lateral blood vessels. the circulatory system is derived from the coelomic cavity of the embryo. some animals may also have cross-connecting vessels in addition to lateral ones. although these are called blood vessels, since they are of coelomic origin, the circulatory fluid is colorless. some species bear hemoglobin as well as other yellow or green pigments. the blood vessels are connected to the rhynchocoel. the flow of fluid in these vessels is facilitated by the contraction of muscles in the body wall. a pair of protonephridia, or primitive kidneys, is present in these animals to facilitate osmoregulation. gaseous exchange occurs through the skin in the nemertini. nemertini have a ganglion or brain situated at the anterior end between the mouth and the foregut, surrounding the digestive system as well as the rhynchocoel. a ring of four nerve masses called ganglia composes the brain in these animals. paired longitudinal nerve cords emerge from the brain ganglia and extend to the posterior end. ocelli or eyespots are present in pairs, in multiples of two in the anterior portion of the body. it is speculated that the eyespots originate from neural tissue and not from the epidermis. animals in phylum nemertea show sexual dimorphism, although freshwater species may be hermaphroditic. eggs and sperm are released into the water, and fertilization occurs externally. the zygote then develops into a planuliform larva. in some nemertine species, a pilidium larva may develop inside the young worm, from a series of imaginal discs. this larval form, characteristically shaped like a deerstalker cap, devours tissues from the young worm for survival before metamorphosing into the adult-like morphology. phylum mollusca is the predominant phylum in marine environments. it is estimated that 23 percent of all known marine species are mollusks; there are over 75,000 described species, making them the second most diverse phylum of animals. the name mollusca signifies a soft body, since the earliest descriptions of mollusks came from observations of unshelled cuttlefish. mollusks are predominantly a marine group of animals; however, they are known to inhabit freshwater as well as terrestrial habitats. mollusks display a wide range of morphologies in each class and subclass, but share a few key characteristics, including a muscular foot, a visceral mass containing internal organs, and a mantle that may or may not secrete a shell of calcium carbonate ([link]). mollusks have a muscular foot, which is used for locomotion and anchorage, and varies in shape and function, depending on the type of mollusk under study. in shelled mollusks, this foot is usually the same size as the opening of the shell. the foot is a retractable as well as an extendable organ. the foot is the ventral-most organ, whereas the mantle is the limiting dorsal organ. mollusks are eucoelomate, but the coelomic cavity is restricted to a cavity around the heart in adult animals. the mantle cavity develops independently of the coelomic cavity. the visceral mass is present above the foot, in the visceral hump. this includes digestive, nervous, excretory, reproductive, and respiratory systems. mollusk species that are exclusively aquatic have gills for respiration, whereas some terrestrial species have lungs for respiration. additionally, a tongue-like organ called a radula, which bears chitinous tooth-like ornamentation, is present in many species, and serves to shred or scrape food. the mantle (also known as the pallium) is the dorsal epidermis in mollusks; shelled mollusks are specialized to secrete a chitinous and hard calcareous shell. most mollusks are dioecious animals and fertilization occurs externally, although this is not the case in terrestrial mollusks, such as snails and slugs, or in cephalopods. in some mollusks, the zygote hatches and undergoes two larval stagestrochophore and veligerbefore becoming a young adult; bivalves may exhibit a third larval stage, glochidia. phylum mollusca is a very diverse (85,000 species) group of mostly marine species. mollusks have a dramatic variety of form, ranging from large predatory squids and octopus, some of which show a high degree of intelligence, to grazing forms with elaborately sculpted and colored shells. this phylum can be segregated into seven classes: aplacophora, monoplacophora, polyplacophora, bivalvia, gastropoda, cephalopoda, and scaphopoda. class aplacophora (bearing no plates) includes worm-like animals primarily found in benthic marine habitats. these animals lack a calcareous shell but possess aragonite spicules on their epidermis. they have a rudimentary mantle cavity and lack eyes, tentacles, and nephridia (excretory organs). members of class monoplacophora (bearing one plate) posses a single, cap-like shell that encloses the body. the morphology of the shell and the underlying animal can vary from circular to ovate. a looped digestive system, multiple pairs of excretory organs, many gills, and a pair of gonads are present in these animals. the monoplacophorans were believed extinct and only known via fossil records until the discovery of neopilina galathaea in 1952. today, scientists have identified nearly two dozen extant species. animals in the class polyplacophora (bearing many plates) are commonly known as chitons and bear an armor-like eight-plated shell ([link]). these animals have a broad, ventral foot that is adapted for suction to rocks and other substrates, and a mantle that extends beyond the shell in the form of a girdle. calcareous spines may be present on the girdle to offer protection from predators. respiration is facilitated by ctenidia (gills) that are present ventrally. these animals possess a radula that is modified for scraping. the nervous system is rudimentary with only buccal or cheek ganglia present at the anterior end. eyespots are absent in these animals. a single pair of nephridia for excretion is present. class bivalvia (two shells) includes clams, oysters, mussels, scallops, and geoducks. members of this class are found in marine as well as freshwater habitats. as the name suggests, bivalves are enclosed in a pair of shells (valves are commonly called shells) that are hinged at the dorsal end by shell ligaments as well as shell teeth ([link]). the overall morphology is laterally flattened, and the head region is poorly developed. eyespots and statocysts may be absent in some species. since these animals are suspension feeders, a radula is absent in this class of mollusks. respiration is facilitated by a pair of ctenidia, whereas excretion and osmoregulation are brought about by a pair of nephridia. bivalves often possess a large mantle cavity. in some species, the posterior edges of the mantle may fuse to form two siphons that serve to take in and exude water. one of the functions of the mantle is to secrete the shell. some bivalves like oysters and mussels possess the unique ability to secrete and deposit a calcareous nacre or mother of pearl around foreign particles that may enter the mantle cavity. this property has been commercially exploited to produce pearls. animals in class gastropoda (stomach foot) include well-known mollusks like snails, slugs, conchs, sea hares, and sea butterflies. gastropoda includes shell-bearing species as well as species with a reduced shell. these animals are asymmetrical and usually present a coiled shell ([link]). shells may be planospiral (like a garden hose wound up), commonly seen in garden snails, or conispiral, (like a spiral staircase), commonly seen in marine conches. the visceral mass in the shelled species displays torsion around the perpendicular axis on the center of the foot, which is the key characteristic of this group, along with a foot that is modified for crawling ([link]). most gastropods bear a head with tentacles, eyes, and a style. a complex radula is used by the digestive system and aids in the ingestion of food. eyes may be absent in some gastropods species. the mantle cavity encloses the ctenidia as well as a pair of nephridia. can snail venom be used as a pharmacological painkiller?marine snails of the genus conus ([link]) attack prey with a venomous sting. the toxin released, known as conotoxin, is a peptide with internal disulfide linkages. conotoxins can bring about paralysis in humans, indicating that this toxin attacks neurological targets. some conotoxins have been shown to block neuronal ion channels. these findings have led researchers to study conotoxins for possible medical applications. conotoxins are an exciting area of potential pharmacological development, since these peptides may be possibly modified and used in specific medical conditions to inhibit the activity of specific neurons. for example, these toxins may be used to induce paralysis in muscles in specific health applications, similar to the use of botulinum toxin. since the entire spectrum of conotoxins, as well as their mechanisms of action, are not completely known, the study of their potential applications is still in its infancy. most research to date has focused on their use to treat neurological diseases. they have also shown some efficacy in relieving chronic pain, and the pain associated with conditions like sciatica and shingles. the study and use of biotoxinstoxins derived from living organismsare an excellent example of the application of biological science to modern medicine. class cephalopoda (head foot animals), include octopi, squids, cuttlefish, and nautilus. cephalopods are a class of shell-bearing animals as well as mollusks with a reduced shell. they display vivid coloration, typically seen in squids and octopi, which is used for camouflage. all animals in this class are carnivorous predators and have beak-like jaws at the anterior end. all cephalopods show the presence of a very well-developed nervous system along with eyes, as well as a closed circulatory system. the foot is lobed and developed into tentacles, and a funnel, which is used as their mode of locomotion. suckers are present on the tentacles in octopi and squid. ctenidia are enclosed in a large mantle cavity and are serviced by large blood vessels, each with its own heart associated with it; the mantle has siphonophores that facilitate exchange of water. locomotion in cephalopods is facilitated by ejecting a stream of water for propulsion. this is called jet propulsion. a pair of nephridia is present within the mantle cavity. sexual dimorphism is seen in this class of animals. members of a species mate, and the female then lays the eggs in a secluded and protected niche. females of some species care for the eggs for an extended period of time and may end up dying during that time period. cephalopods such as squids and octopi also produce sepia or a dark ink, which is squirted upon a predator to assist in a quick getaway. reproduction in cephalopods is different from other mollusks in that the egg hatches to produce a juvenile adult without undergoing the trochophore and veliger larval stages. in the shell-bearing nautilus spp., the spiral shell is multi-chambered. these chambers are filled with gas or water to regulate buoyancy. the shell structure in squids and cuttlefish is reduced and is present internally in the form of a squid pen and cuttlefish bone, respectively. examples are shown in [link]. members of class scaphopoda (boat feet) are known colloquially as tusk shells or tooth shells, as evident when examining dentalium, one of the few remaining scaphopod genera ([link]). scaphopods are usually buried in sand with the anterior opening exposed to water.  these animals bear a single conical shell, which has both ends open. the head is rudimentary and protrudes out of the posterior end of the shell. these animals do not possess eyes, but they have a radula, as well as a foot modified into tentacles with a bulbous end, known as captaculae. captaculae serve to catch and manipulate prey. ctenidia are absent in these animals. phylum annelida includes segmented worms. these animals are found in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater habitats, but a presence of water or humidity is a critical factor for their survival, especially in terrestrial habitats. the name of the phylum is derived from the latin word annellus, which means a small ring. animals in this phylum show parasitic and commensal symbioses with other species in their habitat. approximately 16,500 species have been described in phylum annelida. the phylum includes earthworms, polychaete worms, and leeches. annelids show protostomic development in embryonic stages and are often called segmented worms due to their key characteristic of metamerism, or true segmentation. annelids display bilateral symmetry and are worm-like in overall morphology. annelids have a segmented body plan wherein the internal and external morphological features are repeated in each body segment. metamerism allows animals to become bigger by adding compartments while making their movement more efficient.  this metamerism is thought to arise from identical teloblast cells in the embryonic stage, which give rise to identical mesodermal structures. the overall body can be divided into head, body, and pygidium (or tail). the clitellum is a reproductive structure that generates mucus that aids in sperm transfer and gives rise to a cocoon within which fertilization occurs; it appears as a fused band in the anterior third of the animal ([link]). the epidermis is protected by an acellular, external cuticle, but this is much thinner than the cuticle found in the ecdysozoans and does not require periodic shedding for growth. circular as well as longitudinal muscles are located interior to the epidermis. chitinous hairlike extensions, anchored in the epidermis and projecting from the cuticle, called setae/chaetae are present in every segment. annelids show the presence of a true coelom, derived from embryonic mesoderm and protostomy. hence, they are the most advanced worms. a well-developed and complete digestive system is present in earthworms (oligochaetes) with a mouth, muscular pharynx, esophagus, crop, and gizzard being present. the gizzard leads to the intestine and ends in an anal opening. a cross-sectional view of a body segment of an earthworm (a terrestrial type of annelid) is shown in [link]; each segment is limited by a membranous septum that divides the coelomic cavity into a series of compartments. annelids possess a closed circulatory system of dorsal and ventral blood vessels that run parallel to the alimentary canal as well as capillaries that service individual tissues. in addition, these vessels are connected by transverse loops in every segment. these animals lack a well-developed respiratory system, and gas exchange occurs across the moist body surface. excretion is facilitated by a pair of metanephridia (a type of primitive kidney that consists of a convoluted tubule and an open, ciliated funnel) that is present in every segment towards the ventral side. annelids show well-developed nervous systems with a nerve ring of fused ganglia present around the pharynx. the nerve cord is ventral in position and bears enlarged nodes or ganglia in each segment. annelids may be either monoecious with permanent gonads (as in earthworms and leeches) or dioecious with temporary or seasonal gonads that develop (as in polychaetes). however, cross-fertilization is preferred in hermaphroditic animals. these animals may also show simultaneous hermaphroditism and participate in simultaneous sperm exchange when they are aligned for copulation. phylum annelida contains the class polychaeta (the polychaetes) and the class oligochaeta (the earthworms, leeches and their relatives).  earthworms are the most abundant members of the class oligochaeta, distinguished by the presence of the clitellum as well as few, reduced chaetae (oligo- = few; -chaetae = hairs). the number and size of chaetae are greatly diminished in oligochaeta compared to the polychaetes (poly=many, chaetae = hairs). the many chetae of polychaetes are also arranged within fleshy, flat, paired appendages that protrude from each segment called parapodia, which may be specialized for different functions in the polychates. the subclass hirudinea includes leeches such as hirudo medicinalis and hemiclepsis marginata.  the class oligochaeta includes the subclass hirudinia and the subclass brachiobdella. a significant difference between leeches and other annelids is the development of suckers at the anterior and posterior ends and a lack of chaetae. additionally, the segmentation of the body wall may not correspond to the internal segmentation of the coelomic cavity. this adaptation possibly helps the leeches to elongate when they ingest copious quantities of blood from host vertebrates. the subclass brachiobdella includes species like branchiobdella balcanica sketi and branchiobdella astaci, worms that show similarity with leeches as well as oligochaetes. phylum annelida includes vermiform, segmented animals. segmentation is seen in internal anatomy as well, which is called metamerism. annelids are protostomes. these animals have well-developed neuronal and digestive systems. some species bear a specialized band of segments known as a clitellum. annelids show the presence numerous chitinous projections termed chaetae, and polychaetes possess parapodia. suckers are seen in order hirudinea. reproductive strategies include sexual dimorphism, hermaphroditism, and serial hermaphroditism. internal segmentation is absent in class hirudinea. flatworms are acoelomate, triploblastic animals. they lack circulatory and respiratory systems, and have a rudimentary excretory system. this digestive system is incomplete in most species. there are four traditional classes of flatworms, the largely free-living turbellarians, the ectoparasitic monogeneans, and the endoparasitic trematodes and cestodes. trematodes have complex lifecycles involving a molluscan secondary host and a primary host in which sexual reproduction takes place. cestodes, or tapeworms, infect the digestive systems of primary vertebrate hosts. the rotifers are microscopic, multicellular, mostly aquatic organisms that are currently under taxonomic revision. the group is characterized by the rotating, ciliated, wheel-like structure, the corona, on their head. the mastax or jawed pharynx is another structure unique to this group of organisms. the nemertini are the simplest eucoelomates. these ribbon-shaped animals bear a specialized proboscis enclosed within a rhynchocoel. the development of a closed circulatory system derived from the coelom is a significant difference seen in this species compared to other pseudocoelomate phyla. alimentary, nervous, and excretory systems are more developed in the nemertini than in less advanced phyla. embryonic development of nemertine worms proceeds via a planuliform larval stage. phylum mollusca is a large, marine group of invertebrates. mollusks show a variety of morphological variations within the phylum. this phylum is also distinct in that some members exhibit a calcareous shell as an external means of protection. some mollusks have evolved a reduced shell. mollusks are protostomes. the dorsal epidermis in mollusks is modified to form the mantle, which encloses the mantle cavity and visceral organs. this cavity is quite distinct from the coelomic cavity, which in the adult animal surrounds the heart. respiration is facilitated by gills known as ctenidia. a chitinous-toothed tongue called the radula is present in most mollusks. early development in some species occurs via two larval stages: trochophore and veliger. sexual dimorphism is the predominant sexual strategy in this phylum. mollusks can be divided into seven classes, each with distinct morphological characteristics.","[('superphylum lophotrochozoon', 'superphylum

144,stax-bio,28,Invertebrates,4,m44667,Superphylum Ecdysozoa,"
 the superphylum ecdysozoa contains an incredibly large number of species. this is because it contains two of the most diverse animal groups: phylum nematoda (the roundworms) and phylum arthropoda (the arthropods). the most prominant distinguising feature of ecdysozoans is their tough external covering called the cuticle. the cuticle provides a tough, but flexible exoskeleton tht protects these animals from  water loss, predators and other aspects of the external environment.  all members of this superphylum periodically molt, or shed their cuticle as they grow. after molting, they secrete a new cuticle that will last until their next growth phase. the process of molting and replacing the cuticle is called ecdysis, which is how the superphylum derived its name.
 the nematoda, like most other animal phyla, are triploblastic and possess an embryonic mesoderm that is sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm. they are also bilaterally symmetrical, meaning that a longitudinal section will divide them into right and left sides that are symmetrical. furthermore, the nematodes, or roundworms, possess a pseudocoelom and consist of both free-living and parasitic forms. it has been said that were all the non-nematode matter of the biosphere removed, there would remain a shadow of the former world in the form of nematodes.1 the arthropods, one of the most successful taxonomic groups on the planet, are coelomate organisms characterized by a hard exoskeleton and jointed appendages. both the nematodes and arthropods belong to the superphylum ecdysozoa that is believed to be a clade consisting of all evolutionary descendants from one common ancestor. the name derives from the word ecdysis, which refers to the shedding, or molting, of the exoskeleton. the phyla in this group have a hard cuticle that covers their bodies, which must be periodically shed and replaced for them to increase in size. phylum nematoda includes more than 28,000 species with an estimated 16,000 being parasitic in nature. the name nematoda is derived from the greek word nemos, which means thread and includes roundworms. nematodes are present in all habitats with a large number of individuals of each species present in each. the free-living nematode, caenorhabditis elegans has been extensively used as a model system in laboratories all over the world. in contrast with cnidarians, nematodes show a tubular morphology and circular cross-section. these animals are pseudocoelomates and show the presence of a complete digestive system with a distinct mouth and anus. this is in contrast with the cnidarians, where only one opening is present (an incomplete digestive system). the cuticle of nematodes is rich in collagen and a carbohydrate-protein polymer called chitin, and forms an external skeleton outside the epidermis. the cuticle also lines many of the organs internally, including the pharynx and rectum. the epidermis can be either a single layer of cells or a syncytium, which is a multinucleated cell formed from the fusion of uninucleated cells. the overall morphology of these worms is cylindrical, as seen in [link]. the head is radially symmetrical. a mouth opening is present at the anterior end with three or six lips as well as teeth in some species in the form of cuticle extensions. some nematodes may present other external modifications like rings, head shields, or warts. rings, however, do not reflect true internal body segmentation. the mouth leads to a muscular pharynx and intestine, which leads to a rectum and anal opening at the posterior end. the muscles of nematodes differ from those of most animals: they have a longitudinal layer only, which accounts for the whip-like motion of their movement. in nematodes, specialized excretory systems are not well developed. nitrogenous wastes may be lost by diffusion through the entire body or into the pseudocoelom (body cavity), where they are removed by specialized cells. regulation of water and salt content of the body is achieved by renette glands, present under the pharynx in marine nematodes. most nematodes possess four longitudinal nerve cords that run along the length of the body in dorsal, ventral, and lateral positions. the ventral nerve cord is better developed than the dorsal or lateral cords. all nerve cords fuse at the anterior end, around the pharynx, to form head ganglia or the brain of the worm (which take the form of a ring around the pharynx) as well as at the posterior end to form the tail ganglia. in c. elegans, the nervous system accounts for nearly one-third of the total number of cells in the animal. nematodes employ a variety of reproductive strategies that range from monoecious to dioecious to parthenogenic, depending upon the species under consideration. c. elegans is a monoecious species and shows development of ova contained in a uterus as well as sperm contained in the spermatheca. the uterus has an external opening known as the vulva. the female genital pore is near the middle of the body, whereas the males is at the tip. specialized structures at the tail of the male keep him in place while he deposits sperm with copulatory spicules. fertilization is internal, and embryonic development starts very soon after fertilization. the embryo is released from the vulva during the gastrulation stage. the embryonic development stage lasts for 14 hours; development then continues through four successive larval stages with ecdysis between each stagel1, l2, l3, and l4ultimately leading to the development of a young male or female adult worm. adverse environmental conditions like overcrowding and lack of food can result in the formation of an intermediate larval stage known as the dauer larva. c. elegans: the model system for linking developmental studies with genetics if biologists wanted to research how nicotine dependence develops in the body, how lipids are regulated, or observe the attractant or repellant properties of certain odors, they would clearly need to design three very different experiments. however, they might only need one object of study: c.  elegans. the nematode caenorhabditis elegans was brought into the focus of mainstream biological research by dr. sydney brenner. since 1963, dr. brenner and scientists worldwide have used this animal as a model system to study various physiological and developmental mechanisms. c. elegans is a free-living organism found in soil. it is easy to culture this organism on agar plates (10,000 worms/plate), it feeds on escherichia coli (another long-term resident of biological laboratories worldwide), and therefore, it can be readily grown and maintained in a laboratory. the biggest asset of this nematode is its transparency, which helps researchers to observe and monitor changes within the animal with ease. it is also a simple organism with fewer than 1,000 cells and a genome of 20,000 genes. it shows chromosomal organization of dna into five pairs of autosomes plus a pair of sex chromosomes, making it an ideal candidate to study genetics. since every cell can be visualized and identified, this organism is useful for studying cellular phenomena like cell-cell interactions, cell-fate determinations, cell division, apoptosis, and intracellular transport. another tremendous asset is the short life cycle of this worm ([link]). it takes only 3 days to achieve the egg to adult to daughter egg; therefore, tracking genetic changes is easier in this animal. the total life span of c.  elegans is 2 to 3 weeks; hence, age-related phenomena are easy to observe. another feature that makes c.  elegans an excellent experimental model system is that the position and number of the 959 cells present in adult hermaphrodites of this organism is constant. this feature is extremely significant when studying cell differentiation, cell-cell communication, and apoptosis. lastly, c.  elegans is also amenable to genetic manipulations using molecular methods, rounding off its usefulness as a model system. biologists worldwide have created information banks and groups dedicated to research using c. elegans. their findings have led, for example, to better understandings of cell communication during development, neuronal signaling and insight into lipid regulation (which is important in addressing health issues like the development of obesity and diabetes). in recent years, studies have enlightened the medical community with a better understanding of polycystic kidney disease. this simple organism has led biologists to complex and significant findings, growing the field of science in ways that touch the everyday world. a number of common parasitic nematodes serve as prime examples of parasitism. these animals exhibit complex lifecycles that involve multiple hosts, and they can have significant medical and veterinary impacts. humans may become infected by dracunculus medinensis, known as guinea worms, when they drink unfiltered water containing copepods ([link]). hookworms, such as ancyclostoma and necator, infest the intestines and feed on the blood of mammals, especially in dogs, cats, and humans. trichina worms (trichinella) are the causal organism of trichinosis in humans, often resulting from the consumption of undercooked pork; trichinella can infect other mammalian hosts as well. ascaris, a large intestinal roundworm, steals nutrition from its human host and may create physical blockage of the intestines. the filarial worms, such as dirofilaria and wuchereria, are commonly vectored by mosquitoes, which pass the infective agents among mammals through their blood-sucking activity. dirofilaria immitis, a blood-infective parasite, is the notorious dog heartworm species. wuchereria bancrofti infects the lymph nodes of humans, resulting in the non-lethal but deforming condition called elephantiasis, in which parts of the body become swelled to gigantic proportions due to obstruction of lymphatic drainage and inflammation of lymphatic tissues. the name arthropoda means jointed legs (in the greek, arthros means joint and podos means leg); it aptly describes the enormous number of invertebrates included in this phylum. arthropoda dominate the animal kingdom with an estimated 85 percent of known species included in this phylum and many arthropods yet undocumented. the principal characteristics of all the animals in this phylum are functional segmentation of the body and presence of jointed appendages. arthropods also show the presence of an exoskeleton made principally of chitin, which is a waterproof, tough polysaccharide. phylum arthropoda is the largest phylum in the animal world, and insects form the single largest class within this phylum. arthropods are eucoelomate, protostomic organisms. phylum arthropoda includes animals that have been successful in colonizing terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial habitats. this phylum is further classified into five subphyla: trilobitomorpha (trilobites, all extinct), hexapoda (insects and relatives), myriapoda (millipedes, centipedes, and relatives), crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, crayfish, isopods, barnacles, and some zooplankton), and chelicerata (horseshoe crabs, arachnids, scorpions, and daddy longlegs). trilobites are an extinct group of arthropods found chiefly in the pre-cambrian era that are probably most closely related to the chelicerata. these are identified based on fossil records ([link]). a unique feature of animals in the arthropod phylum is the presence of a segmented body and fusion of sets of segments that give rise to functional body regions called tagma. tagma may be in the form of a head, thorax, and abdomen, or a cephalothorax and abdomen, or a head and trunk. a central cavity, called the hemocoel (or blood cavity), is present, and the open circulatory system is regulated by a tubular or single-chambered heart. respiratory systems vary depending on the group of arthropod: insects and myriapods use a series of tubes (tracheae) that branch through the body, open to the outside through openings called spiracles, and perform gas exchange directly between the cells and air in the tracheae, whereas aquatic crustaceans utilize gills, terrestrial chelicerates employ book lungs, and aquatic chelicerates use book gills ([link]).  the book lungs of arachnids (scorpions, spiders, ticks and mites) contain a vertical stack of hemocoel wall tissue  that somewhat resembles the pages of a book. between each of the ""pages"" of tissue is an air space. this allows both sides of the tissue to be in contact with the air at all times, greatly increasing the efficiency of gas exchange. the gills of crustaceans are filamentous structures that exchange gases with the surrounding water. groups of arthropods also differ in the organs used for excretion, with crustaceans possessing green glands and insects using malpighian tubules, which work in conjunction with the hindgut to reabsorb water while ridding the body of nitrogenous waste. the cuticle is the covering of an arthropod. it is made up of two layers: the epicuticle, which is a thin, waxy water-resistant outer layer containing no chitin, and the layer beneath it, the chitinous procuticle. chitin is a tough, flexible polysaccharide. in order to grow, the arthropod must shed the exoskeleton during a process called ecdysis (to strip off); this is a cumbersome method of growth, and during this time, the animal is vulnerable to predation. the characteristic morphology of representative animals from each subphylum is described below. the name hexapoda denotes the presence of six legs (three pairs) in these animals as differentiated from the number of pairs present in other arthropods. hexapods are characterized by the presence of a head, thorax, and abdomen, constituting three tagma. the thorax bears the wings as well as six legs in three pairs. many of the common insects we encounter on a daily basisincluding ants, cockroaches, butterflies, and fliesare examples of hexapoda. amongst the hexapods, the insects ([link]) are the largest class in terms of species diversity as well as biomass in terrestrial habitats. typically, the head bears one pair of sensory antennae, mandibles as mouthparts, a pair of compound eyes, and some ocelli (simple eyes) along with numerous sensory hairs. the thorax bears three pairs of legs (one pair per segment) and two pairs of wings, with one pair each on the second and third thoracic segments. the abdomen usually has eleven segments and bears reproductive apertures. hexapoda includes insects that are winged (like fruit flies) and wingless (like fleas). subphylum myriapoda includes arthropods with numerous legs. although the name is hyperbolic in suggesting that myriad legs are present in these invertebrates, the number of legs may vary from 10 to 750. this subphylum includes 13,000 species; the most commonly found examples are millipedes and centipedes. all myriapods are terrestrial animals and prefer a humid environment. myriapods are typically found in moist soils, decaying biological material, and leaf litter. subphylum myriapoda is divided into four classes: chilopoda, symphyla, diplopoda, and pauropoda. centipedes like scutigera coleoptrata ([link]) are classified as chilopods. these animals bear one pair of legs per segment, mandibles as mouthparts, and are somewhat dorsoventrally flattened. the legs in the first segment are modified to form forcipules (poison claws) that deliver poison to prey like spiders and cockroaches, as these animals are all predatory. millipedes bear two pairs of legs per diplosegment, a feature that results from embryonic fusion of adjacent pairs of body segments, are usually rounder in cross-section, and are herbivores or detritivores. millipedes have visibly more numbers of legs as compared to centipedes, although they do not bear a thousand legs ([link]). crustaceans are the most dominant aquatic arthropods, since the total number of marine crustacean species stands at 67,000, but there are also freshwater and terrestrial crustacean species. krill, shrimp, lobsters, crabs, and crayfish are examples of crustaceans ([link]). terrestrial species like the wood lice (armadillidium spp.) (also called pill bugs, rolly pollies, potato bugs, or isopods) are also crustaceans, although the number of non-aquatic species in this subphylum is relatively low. crustaceans possess two pairs of antennae, mandibles as mouthparts, and biramous (two branched) appendages, which means that their legs are formed in two parts, as distinct from the uniramous (one branched) myriapods and hexapods ([link]). unlike that of the hexapoda, the head and thorax of most crustaceans is fused to form a cephalothorax ([link]), which is covered by a plate called the carapace, thus producing a body structure of two tagma. crustaceans have a chitinous exoskeleton that is shed by molting whenever the animal increases in size. the exoskeletons of many species are also infused with calcium carbonate, which makes them even stronger than in other arthropods. crustaceans have an open circulatory system where blood is pumped into the hemocoel by the dorsally located heart. hemocyanin and hemoglobin are the respiratory pigments present in these animals. most crustaceans are dioecious, which means that the sexes are separate. some species like barnacles may be hermaphrodites. serial hermaphroditism, where the gonad can switch from producing sperm to ova, may also be seen in some species. fertilized eggs may be held within the female of the species or may be released in the water. terrestrial crustaceans seek out damp spaces in their habitats to lay eggs. larval stagesnauplius and zoeaare seen in the early development of crustaceans. a cypris larva is also seen in the early development of barnacles ([link]). crustaceans possess a tripartite brain and two compound eyes. most crustaceans are carnivorous, but herbivorous and detritivorous species are also known. crustaceans may also be cannibalistic when extremely high populations of these organisms are present. this subphylum includes animals such as spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, and sea spiders. this subphylum is predominantly terrestrial, although some marine species also exist. an estimated 77,000 species are included in subphylum chelicerata. chelicerates are found in almost all habitats. the body of chelicerates may be divided into two parts: prosoma and opisthosoma, which are basically the equivalents of cephalothorax (usually smaller) and abdomen (usually larger). a head tagmum is not usually discernible. the phylum derives its name from the first pair of appendages: the chelicerae ([link]), which are specialized, claw-like or fang-like mouthparts. these animals do not possess antennae. the second pair of appendages is known as pedipalps. in some species, like sea spiders, an additional pair of appendages, called ovigers, is present between the chelicerae and pedipalps. chelicerae are mostly used for feeding, but in spiders, these are often modified into fangs that inject venom into their prey before feeding ([link]). members of this subphylum have an open circulatory system with a heart that pumps blood into the hemocoel. aquatic species have gills, whereas terrestrial species have either trachea or book lungs for gaseous exchange. most chelicerates ingest food using a preoral cavity formed by the chelicerae and pedipalps. some chelicerates may secrete digestive enzymes to pre-digest food before ingesting it. parasitic chelicerates like ticks and mites have evolved blood-sucking apparatuses. the nervous system in chelicerates consists of a brain and two ventral nerve cords. these animals use external fertilization as well as internal fertilization strategies for reproduction, depending upon the species and its habitat. parental care for the young ranges from absolutely none to relatively prolonged care. nematodes are pseudocoelomate animals akin to flatworms, yet display more advanced neuronal development, a complete digestive system, and a body cavity. this phylum includes free-living as well as parasitic organisms like caenorhabditis elegans and ascaris spp., respectively. they include dioeceous as well as hermaphroditic species. nematodes also possess an excretory system that is not quite well developed. embryonic development is external and proceeds via three larval stages. a peculiar feature of nematodes is the secretion of a collagenous/chitinous cuticle outside the body. arthropods represent the most successful phylum of animal on earth, in terms of the number of species as well as the number of individuals. these animals are characterized by a segmented body as well as the presence of jointed appendages. in the basic body plan, a pair of appendages is present per body segment. within the phylum, traditional classification is based on mouthparts, number of appendages, and modifications of appendages present. arthropods bear a chitinous exoskeleton. gills, trachea, and book lungs facilitate respiration. sexual dimorphism is seen in this phylum, and embryonic development includes multiple larval stages.","[('invertebrate', 'invertebrates'),

145,stax-bio,28,Invertebrates,5,m44681,Superphylum Deuterostomia,"the phyla echinodermata and chordata (the phylum in which humans are placed) both belong to the superphylum deuterostomia. recall that protostome and deuterostomes differ in certain aspects of their embryonic development, and they are named based on which opening of the digestive cavity develops first. the word deuterostome comes from the greek word meaning mouth second, indicating that the anus is the first to develop. there are a series of other developmental characteristics that differ between protostomes and deuterostomes, including the mode of formation of the coelom and the early cell division of the embryo. in deuterostomes, internal pockets of the endodermal lining called the archenteron fuse to form the coelom. the endodermal lining of the archenteron (or the primitive gut) forms membrane protrusions that bud off and become the mesodermal layer. these buds, known as coelomic pouches, fuse to form the coelomic cavity, as they eventually separate from the endodermal layer. the resultant coelom is termed an enterocoelom. the archenteron develops into the alimentary canal, and a mouth opening is formed by invagination of ectoderm at the pole opposite the blastopore of the gastrula. the blastopore forms the anus of the alimentary system in the juvenile and adult forms. the fates of embryonic cells in deuterostomes can be altered if they are experimentally moved to a different location in the embryo due to indeterminant cleavage in early embryogenesis. echinodermata are so named owing to their spiny skin (from the greek echinos meaning spiny and dermos meaning skin), and this phylum is a collection of about 7,000 described living species. echinodermata are exclusively marine organisms. sea stars ([link]), sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sand dollars, and brittle stars are all examples of echinoderms. to date, no freshwater or terrestrial echinoderms are known. adult echinoderms exhibit pentaradial symmetry and have a calcareous endoskeleton made of ossicles, although the early larval stages of all echinoderms have bilateral symmetry. the endoskeleton is developed by epidermal cells and may possess pigment cells, giving vivid colors to these animals, as well as cells laden with toxins. gonads are present in each arm. in echinoderms like sea stars, every arm bears two rows of tube feet on the oral side. these tube feet help in attachment to the substratum. these animals possess a true coelom that is modified into a unique circulatory system called a water vascular system. an interesting feature of these animals is their power to regenerate, even when over 75 percent of their body mass is lost. echinoderms possess a unique ambulacral or water vascular system, consisting of a central ring canal and radial canals that extend along each arm. water circulates through these structures and facilitates gaseous exchange as well as nutrition, predation, and locomotion. the water vascular system also projects from holes in the skeleton in the form of tube feet. these tube feet can expand or contract based on the volume of water present in the system of that arm. by using hydrostatic pressure, the animal can either protrude or retract the tube feet. water enters the madreporite on the aboral side of the echinoderm. from there, it passes into the stone canal, which moves water into the ring canal. the ring canal connects the radial canals (there are five in a pentaradial animal), and the radial canals move water into the ampullae, which have tube feet through which the water moves. by moving water through the unique water vascular system, the echinoderm can move and force open mollusk shells during feeding. the nervous system in these animals is a relatively simple structure with a nerve ring at the center and five radial nerves extending outward along the arms. structures analogous to a brain or derived from fusion of ganglia are not present in these animals. podocytes, cells specialized for ultrafiltration of bodily fluids, are present near the center of echinoderms. these podocytes are connected by an internal system of canals to an opening called the madreporite. echinoderms are sexually dimorphic and release their eggs and sperm cells into water; fertilization is external. in some species, the larvae divide asexually and multiply before they reach sexual maturity. echinoderms may also reproduce asexually, as well as regenerate body parts lost in trauma. this phylum is divided into five extant classes: asteroidea (sea stars), ophiuroidea (brittle stars),echinoidea (sea urchins and sand dollars),crinoidea (sea lilies or feather stars), andholothuroidea (sea cucumbers) ([link]). the most well-known echinoderms are members of class asteroidea, or sea stars. they come in a large variety of shapes, colors, and sizes, with more than 1,800 species known so far. the key characteristic of sea stars that distinguishes them from other echinoderm classes includes thick arms (ambulacra) that extend from a central disk where organs penetrate into the arms. sea stars use their tube feet not only for gripping surfaces but also for grasping prey. sea stars have two stomachs, one of which can protrude through their mouths and secrete digestive juices into or onto prey, even before ingestion. this process can essentially liquefy the prey and make digestion easier. brittle stars belong to the class ophiuroidea. unlike sea stars, which have plump arms, brittle stars have long, thin arms that are sharply demarcated from the central disk. brittle stars move by lashing out their arms or wrapping them around objects and pulling themselves forward. sea urchins and sand dollars are examples of echinoidea. these echinoderms do not have arms, but are hemispherical or flattened with five rows of tube feet that help them in slow movement; tube feet are extruded through pores of a continuous internal shell called a test. sea lilies and feather stars are examples of crinoidea. both of these species are suspension feeders. sea cucumbers of class holothuroidea are extended in the oral-aboral axis and have five rows of tube feet. these are the only echinoderms that demonstrate functional bilateral symmetry as adults, because the uniquely extended oral-aboral axis compels the animal to lie horizontally rather than stand vertically. animals in the phylum chordata share four key features that appear at some stage of their development: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. in some groups, some of these traits are present only during embryonic development. in addition to containing vertebrate classes, the phylum chordata contains two clades of invertebrates: urochordata (tunicates) and cephalochordata (lancelets). most tunicates live on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders. lancelets are suspension feeders that feed on phytoplankton and other microorganisms. echinoderms are deuterostomic marine organisms. this phylum of animals bears a calcareous endoskeleton composed of ossicles. these animals also have spiny skin. echinoderms possess water-based circulatory systems. a pore termed the madreporite is the point of entry and exit for water into the water vascular system. osmoregulation is carried out by specialized cells known as podocytes. the characteristic features of chordata are a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. chordata contains two clades of invertebrates: urochordata (tunicates) and cephalochordata (lancelets), together with the vertebrates in vertebrata. most tunicates live on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders. lancelets are suspension feeders that feed on phytoplankton and other microorganisms.","[('ambulacral system', 'ambulacral systems'), ('invertebrate', 'invertebrates'), ('echinoderm nervous system', 'echinoderm nervous systems'), ('echinoderm reproduction', 'echinoderm reproductions'), ('echinoderm excretory system', 'echinoderm excretory systems', 'echinoderms excretory system', 'echinoderms excretory systems'), ('echinoderm anatomy', 'echinoderm anatomies'), ('echinoderm', 'echinoderms'), ('echinodermatum', 'echinodermatas', 'echinodermata'), ('invertebratum', 'invertebratas', 'invertebrata'), ('madreporite', 'madreporites'), ('phylum echinodermatum', 'phylum echinodermatas', 'phylum echinodermata'), ('echinoderm morphology', 'echinoderm morphologies')]"
146,stax-bio,29,Vertebrates,0,m44684,Introduction,"vertebrates are among the most recognizable organisms of the animal kingdom. more than 62,000 vertebrate species have been identified. the vertebrate species now living represent only a small portion of the vertebrates that have existed. the best-known extinct vertebrates are the dinosaurs, a unique group of reptiles, which reached sizes not seen before or after in terrestrial animals. they were the dominant terrestrial animals for 150 million years, until they died out in a mass extinction near the end of the cretaceous period. although it is not known with certainty what caused their extinction, a great deal is known about the anatomy of the dinosaurs, given the preservation of skeletal elements in the fossil record. currently, a number of vertebrate species face extinction primarily due to habitat loss and pollution. according to the international union for the conservation of nature, more than 6,000 vertebrate species are classified as threatened. amphibians and mammals are the classes with the greatest percentage of threatened species, with 29 percent of all amphibians and 21 percent of all mammals classified as threatened. attempts are being made around the world to prevent the extinction of threatened species. for example, the biodiversity action plan is an international program, ratified by 188 countries, which is designed to protect species and habitats.","[('amniote evolution', 'amniote evolutions'), ('synapsid', 'synapsids'), ('jawless fish', 'jawless fish'), ('sebaceous gland', 'sebaceous glands'),

147,stax-bio,29,Vertebrates,1,m44685,Chordates,"vertebrates are members of the kingdom animalia and the phylum chordata ([link]). recall that animals that possess bilateral symmetry can be divided into two groupsprotostomes and deuterostomesbased on their patterns of embryonic development. the deuterostomes, whose name translates as second mouth, consist of two phyla: chordata and echinodermata. echinoderms are invertebrate marine animals that have pentaradial symmetry and a spiny body covering, a group that includes sea stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. the most conspicuous and familiar members of chordata are vertebrates, but this phylum also includes two groups of invertebrate chordates. animals in the phylum chordata share four key features that appear at some stage during their development: a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail ([link]). in some groups, some of these are present only during embryonic development. the chordates are named for the notochord, which is a flexible, rod-shaped structure that is found in the embryonic stage of all chordates and in the adult stage of some chordate species. it is located between the digestive tube and the nerve cord, and provides skeletal support through the length of the body. in some chordates, the notochord acts as the primary axial support of the body throughout the animals lifetime. in vertebrates, the notochord is present during embryonic development, at which time it induces the development of the neural tube and serves as a support for the developing embryonic body. the notochord, however, is not found in the postnatal stage of vertebrates; at this point, it has been replaced by the vertebral column (that is, the spine). the dorsal hollow nerve cord derives from ectoderm that rolls into a hollow tube during development. in chordates, it is located dorsal to the notochord. in contrast, other animal phyla are characterized by solid nerve cords that are located either ventrally or laterally. the nerve cord found in most chordate embryos develops into the brain and spinal cord, which compose the central nervous system. pharyngeal slits are openings in the pharynx (the region just posterior to the mouth) that extend to the outside environment. in organisms that live in aquatic environments, pharyngeal slits allow for the exit of water that enters the mouth during feeding. some invertebrate chordates use the pharyngeal slits to filter food out of the water that enters the mouth. in vertebrate fishes, the pharyngeal slits are modified into gill supports, and in jawed fishes, into jaw supports. in tetrapods, the slits are modified into components of the ear and tonsils. tetrapod literally means four-footed, which refers to the phylogenetic history of various groups that evolved accordingly, even though some now possess fewer than two pairs of walking appendages. tetrapods include amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. the post-anal tail is a posterior elongation of the body, extending beyond the anus. the tail contains skeletal elements and muscles, which provide a source of locomotion in aquatic species, such as fishes. in some terrestrial vertebrates, the tail also helps with balance, courting, and signaling when danger is near. in humans, the post-anal tail is vestigial, that is, reduced in size and nonfunctional. click for a video discussing the evolution of chordates and five characteristics that they share.
 chordata also contains two clades of invertebrates: urochordata and cephalochordata. members of these groups also possess the four distinctive features of chordates at some point during their development. members of urochordata are also known as tunicates ([link]). the name tunicate derives from the cellulose-like carbohydrate material, called the tunic, which covers the outer body of tunicates. although adult tunicates are classified as chordates, they do not have a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, or a post-anal tail, although they do have pharyngeal slits. the larval form, however, possesses all four structures. most tunicates are hermaphrodites. tunicate larvae hatch from eggs inside the adult tunicates body. after hatching, a tunicate larva swims for a few days until it finds a suitable surface on which it can attach, usually in a dark or shaded location. it then attaches via the head to the surface and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form, at which point the notochord, nerve cord, and tail disappear. most tunicates live a sessile existence on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders. the primary foods of tunicates are plankton and detritus. seawater enters the tunicates body through its incurrent siphon. suspended material is filtered out of this water by a mucous net (pharyngeal slits) and is passed into the intestine via the action of cilia. the anus empties into the excurrent siphon, which expels wastes and water. tunicates are found in shallow ocean waters around the world. members of cephalochordata possess a notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail in the adult stage ([link]). the notochord extends into the head, which gives the subphylum its name. extinct members of this subphylum include pikaia, which is the oldest known cephalochordate. pikaia fossils were recovered from the burgess shales of canada and dated to the middle of the cambrian age, making them more than 500 million years old. extant members of cephalochordata are the lancelets, named for their blade-like shape. lancelets are only a few centimeters long and are usually found buried in sand at the bottom of warm temperate and tropical seas. like tunicates, they are suspension feeders. a cranium is a bony, cartilaginous, or fibrous structure surrounding the brain, jaw, and facial bones ([link]). most bilaterally symmetrical animals have a head; of these, those that have a cranium compose the clade craniata. craniata includes the hagfishes (myxini), which have a cranium but lack a backbone, and all of the organisms called vertebrates. vertebrates are members of the clade vertebrata. vertebrates display the four characteristic features of the chordates; however, members of this group also share derived characteristics that distinguish them from invertebrate chordates. vertebrata is named for the vertebral column, composed of vertebrae, a series of separate bones joined together as a backbone ([link]). in adult vertebrates, the vertebral column replaces the notochord, which is only seen in the embryonic stage. based on molecular analysis, vertebrates appear to be more closely related to lancelets (cephalochordates) than to tunicates (urochordates) among the invertebrate chordates. this evidence suggests that the cephalochordates diverged from urochordata and the vertebrates subsequently diverged from the cephalochordates. this hypothesis is further supported by the discovery of a fossil in china from the genus haikouella. this organism seems to be an intermediate form between cephalochordates and vertebrates. the haikouella fossils are about 530 million years old and appear similar to modern lancelets. these organisms had a brain and eyes, as do vertebrates, but lack the skull found in craniates.1 this evidence suggests that vertebrates arose during the cambrian explosion. recall that the cambrian explosion is the name given to a relatively brief span of time during the cambrian period during which many animal groups appeared and rapidly diversified. most modern animal phyla originated during the cambrian explosion. vertebrates are the largest group of chordates, with more than 62,000 living species. vertebrates are grouped based on anatomical and physiological traits. more than one classification and naming scheme is used for these animals. here we will consider the traditional groups agnatha, chondrichthyes, osteichthyes, amphibia, reptilia, aves, and mammalia, which constitute classes in the subphylum vertebrata. many modern authors classify birds within reptilia, which correctly reflects their evolutionary heritage. we consider them separately only for convenience. further, we will consider hagfishes and lampreys together as jawless fishes, the agnathans, although emerging classification schemes separate them into chordate jawless fishes (the hagfishes) and vertebrate jawless fishes (the lampreys). animals that possess jaws are known as gnathostomes, which means jawed mouth. gnathostomes include fishes and tetrapodsamphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. tetrapods can be further divided into two groups: amphibians and amniotes. amniotes are animals whose eggs are adapted for terrestrial living, and this group includes mammals, reptiles, and birds. amniotic embryos, developing in either an externally shed egg or an egg carried by the female, are provided with a water-retaining environment and are protected by amniotic membranes. the characteristic features of chordata are a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail. chordata contains two clades of invertebrates: urochordata (tunicates) and cephalochordata (lancelets), together with the vertebrates in vertebrata. most tunicates live on the ocean floor and are suspension feeders. lancelets are suspension feeders that feed on phytoplankton and other microorganisms. vertebrata is named for the vertebral column, which is a feature of almost all members of this clade.","[('tunicate', 'tunicates'), ('lancelet', 'lancelets'), ('cranium', 'crania'), ('craniatum', 'craniatas', 'craniata'), ('vertebratum', 'vertebratas', 'vertebrata'), ('tetrapod', 'tetrapods'), ('vertebrate', 'vertebratess', 'vertebrates'), ('chordate', 'chordates'), ('pharyngeal slit', 'pharyngeal slitss', 'pharyngeal slits'), ('cephalochordatum', 'cephalochordatas', 'cephalochordata'), ('post-anal tail', 'post-anal tails'), ('amniote', 'amniotes'), ('dorsal hollow nerve cord', 'dorsal hollow nerve cords', 'dorsal hollow nerves cord', 'dorsal hollow nerves cords', 'dorsals hollow nerve cord', 'dorsals hollow nerve cords', 'dorsals hollow nerves cord', 'dorsals hollow nerves cords'), ('notochord', 'notochords'), ('vertebrate', 'vertebrates'), ('urochordatum', 'urochordatas', 'urochordata'), ('vertebral column', 'vertebral columns'), ('craniate', 'craniates'), ('chordatum', 'chordatas', 'chordata')]"
148,stax-bio,29,Vertebrates,2,m44687,Fishes,"modern fishes include an estimated 31,000 species. fishes were the earliest vertebrates, with jawless species being the earliest and jawed species evolving later. they are active feeders, rather than sessile, suspension feeders. jawless fishesthe hagfishes and lampreyshave a distinct cranium and complex sense organs including eyes, distinguishing them from the invertebrate chordates. jawless fishes are craniates that represent an ancient vertebrate lineage that arose over one half-billion years ago. in the past, the hagfishes and lampreys were classified together as agnathans. today, hagfishes and lampreys are recognized as separate clades, primarily because lampreys are true vertebrates, whereas hagfishes are not. a defining feature is the lack of paired lateral appendages (fins). some of the earliest jawless fishes were the ostracoderms (which translates to shell-skin). ostracoderms were vertebrate fishes encased in bony armor, unlike present-day jawless fishes, which lack bone in their scales. the clade myxini includes at least 20 species of hagfishes. hagfishes are eel-like scavengers that live on the ocean floor and feed on dead invertebrates, other fishes, and marine mammals ([link]). hagfishes are entirely marine and are found in oceans around the world, except for the polar regions. a unique feature of these animals is the slime glands beneath the skin that release mucus through surface pores. this mucus allows the hagfish to escape from the grip of predators. hagfish can also twist their bodies in a knot to feed and sometimes eat carcasses from the inside out. the skeleton of a hagfish is composed of cartilage, which includes a cartilaginous notochord that runs the length of the body. this notochord provides support to the hagfishs body. hagfishes do not replace the notochord with a vertebral column during development, as do true vertebrates. the clade petromyzontidae includes approximately 3540 or more species of lampreys. lampreys are similar to hagfishes in size and shape; however, lampreys possess some vertebral elements. lampreys lack paired appendages and bone, as do the hagfishes. as adults, lampreys are characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. many species have a parasitic stage of their life cycle during which they are ectoparasites of fishes ([link]). lampreys live primarily in coastal and fresh waters, and have a worldwide distribution, except for in the tropics and polar regions. some species are marine, but all species spawn in fresh water. eggs are fertilized externally, and the larvae distinctly differ from the adult form, spending 3 to 15 years as suspension feeders. once they attain sexual maturity, the adults reproduce and die within days. lampreys possess a notochord as adults; however, this notochord is surrounded by a cartilaginous structure called an arcualia, which may resemble an evolutionarily early form of the vertebral column. gnathostomes or jaw-mouths are vertebrates that possess jaws. one of the most significant developments in early vertebrate evolution was the development of the jaw, which is a hinged structure attached to the cranium that allows an animal to grasp and tear its food. the evolution of jaws allowed early gnathostomes to exploit food resources that were unavailable to jawless fishes. early gnathostomes also possessed two sets of paired fins, allowing the fishes to maneuver accurately. pectoral fins are typically located on the anterior body, and pelvic fins on the posterior. evolution of the jaw and paired fins permitted gnathostomes to expand from the sedentary suspension feeding of jawless fishes to become mobile predators. the ability of gnathostomes to exploit new nutrient sources likely is one reason that they replaced most jawless fishes during the devonian period. two early groups of gnathostomes were the acanthodians and placoderms ([link]), which arose in the late silurian period and are now extinct. most modern fishes are gnathostomes that belong to the clades chondrichthyes and osteichthyes. the clade chondrichthyes is diverse, consisting of sharks ([link]), rays, and skates, together with sawfishes and a few dozen species of fishes called chimaeras, or ghost sharks. chondrichthyes are jawed fishes that possess paired fins and a skeleton made of cartilage. this clade arose approximately 370 million years ago in the early or middle devonian. they are thought to be descended from the placoderms, which had skeletons made of bone; thus, the cartilaginous skeleton of chondrichthyes is a later development. parts of shark skeleton are strengthened by granules of calcium carbonate, but this is not the same as bone. most cartilaginous fishes live in marine habitats, with a few species living in fresh water for a part or all of their lives. most sharks are carnivores that feed on live prey, either swallowing it whole or using their jaws and teeth to tear it into smaller pieces. shark teeth likely evolved from the jagged scales that cover their skin, called placoid scales. some species of sharks and rays are suspension feeders that feed on plankton. sharks have well-developed sense organs that aid them in locating prey, including a keen sense of smell and electroreception, with the latter perhaps the most sensitive of any animal. organs called ampullae of lorenzini allow sharks to detect the electromagnetic fields that are produced by all living things, including their prey. electroreception has only been observed in aquatic or amphibious animals. sharks, together with most fishes and aquatic and larval amphibians, also have a sense organ called the lateral line, which is used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water, and is often considered homologous to hearing in terrestrial vertebrates. the lateral line is visible as a darker stripe that runs along the length of a fishs body. sharks reproduce sexually, and eggs are fertilized internally. most species are ovoviviparous: the fertilized egg is retained in the oviduct of the mothers body and the embryo is nourished by the egg yolk. the eggs hatch in the uterus, and young are born alive and fully functional. some species of sharks are oviparous: they lay eggs that hatch outside of the mothers body. embryos are protected by a shark egg case or mermaids purse ([link]) that has the consistency of leather. the shark egg case has tentacles that snag in seaweed and give the newborn shark cover.  a few species of sharks are viviparous: the young develop within the mothers body and she gives live birth. rays and skates comprise more than 500 species and are closely related to sharks. they can be distinguished from sharks by their flattened bodies, pectoral fins that are enlarged and fused to the head, and gill slits on their ventral surface ([link]). like sharks, rays and skates have a cartilaginous skeleton. most species are marine and live on the sea floor, with nearly a worldwide distribution. members of the clade osteichthyes, also called bony fishes, are characterized by a bony skeleton. the vast majority of present-day fishes belong to this group, which consists of approximately 30,000 species, making it the largest class of vertebrates in existence today. nearly all bony fishes have an ossified skeleton with specialized bone cells (osteocytes) that produce and maintain a calcium phosphate matrix. this characteristic has only reversed in a few groups of osteichthyes, such as sturgeons and paddlefish, which have primarily cartilaginous skeletons. the skin of bony fishes is often covered by overlapping scales, and glands in the skin secrete mucus that reduces drag when swimming and aids the fish in osmoregulation. like sharks, bony fishes have a lateral line system that detects vibrations in water. all bony fishes use gills to breathe. water is drawn over gills that are located in chambers covered and ventilated by a protective, muscular flap called the operculum. many bony fishes also have a swim bladder, a gas-filled organ that helps to control the buoyancy of the fish. bony fishes are further divided into two extant clades: actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) and sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes). actinopterygii, the ray-finned fishes, include many familiar fishestuna, bass, trout, and salmon ([link]a), among others. ray-finned fishes are named for their fins that are webs of skin supported by bony spines called rays. in contrast, the fins of sarcopterygii are fleshy and lobed, supported by bone ([link]b). living members of this clade include the less-familiar lungfishes and coelacanths. the earliest vertebrates that diverged from the invertebrate chordates were the jawless fishes. fishes with jaws (gnathostomes) evolved later. jaws allowed early gnathostomes to exploit new food sources. agnathans include the hagfishes and lampreys. hagfishes are eel-like scavengers that feed on dead invertebrates and other fishes. lampreys are characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth, and most species are parasitic on other fishes. gnathostomes include the cartilaginous fishes and the bony fishes, as well as all other tetrapods. cartilaginous fishes include sharks, rays, skates, and ghost sharks. most cartilaginous fishes live in marine habitats, with a few species living in fresh water for part or all of their lives. the vast majority of present-day fishes belong to the clade osteichthyes, which consists of approximately 30,000 species. bony fishes can be divided into two clades: actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes, virtually all extant species) and sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes, comprising fewer than 10 extant species but which are the ancestors of tetrapods).","[('hagfish', 'hagfish'), ('fish', 'fishess', 'fishes'), ('myxini', 'myxinis'), ('ostracoderm', 'ostracoderms'), ('lateral line', 'lateral lines'),

149,stax-bio,29,Vertebrates,3,m44688,Amphibians,"amphibians are vertebrate tetrapods. amphibia includes frogs, salamanders, and caecilians. the term amphibian loosely translates from the greek as dual life, which is a reference to the metamorphosis that many frogs and salamanders undergo and their mixture of aquatic and terrestrial environments in their life cycle. amphibians evolved during the devonian period and were the earliest terrestrial tetrapods. watch this series of five animal planet videos on tetrapod evolution:  as tetrapods, most amphibians are characterized by four well-developed limbs. some species of salamanders and all caecilians are functionally limbless; their limbs are vestigial. an important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist, permeable skin that is achieved via mucus glands that keep the skin moist; thus, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the environment can take place through it (cutaneous respiration). additional characteristics of amphibians include pedicellate teethteeth in which the root and crown are calcified, separated by a zone of noncalcified tissueand a papilla amphibiorum and papilla basilaris, structures of the inner ear that are sensitive to frequencies below and above 10,00 hertz, respectively. amphibians also have an auricular operculum, which is an extra bone in the ear that transmits sounds to the inner ear. all extant adult amphibians are carnivorous, and some terrestrial amphibians have a sticky tongue that is used to capture prey. the fossil record provides evidence of the first tetrapods: now-extinct amphibian species dating to nearly 400 million years ago. evolution of tetrapods from fishes represented a significant change in body plan from one suited to organisms that respired and swam in water, to organisms that breathed air and moved onto land; these changes occurred over a span of 50 million years during the devonian period. one of the earliest known tetrapods is from the genus acanthostega. acanthostega was aquatic; fossils show that it had gills similar to fishes. however, it also had four limbs, with the skeletal structure of limbs found in present-day tetrapods, including amphibians. therefore, it is thought that acanthostega lived in shallow waters and was an intermediate form between lobe-finned fishes and early, fully terrestrial tetrapods. what preceded acanthostega? in 2006, researchers published news of their discovery of a fossil of a tetrapod-like fish, tiktaalik roseae, which seems to be an intermediate form between fishes having fins and tetrapods having limbs ([link]). tiktaalik likely lived in a shallow water environment about 375 million years ago.1 the early tetrapods that moved onto land had access to new nutrient sources and relatively few predators. this led to the widespread distribution of tetrapods during the early carboniferous period, a period sometimes called the age of the amphibians. amphibia comprises an estimated 6,770 extant species that inhabit tropical and temperate regions around the world. amphibians can be divided into three clades: urodela (tailed-ones), the salamanders; anura (tail-less ones), the frogs; and apoda (legless ones), the caecilians. salamanders are amphibians that belong to the order urodela. living salamanders ([link]) include approximately 620 species, some of which are aquatic, other terrestrial, and some that live on land only as adults. adult salamanders usually have a generalized tetrapod body plan with four limbs and a tail. they move by bending their bodies from side to side, called lateral undulation, in a fish-like manner while walking their arms and legs fore and aft. it is thought that their gait is similar to that used by early tetrapods. respiration differs among different species. the majority of salamanders are lungless, and respiration occurs through the skin or through external gills. some terrestrial salamanders have primitive lungs; a few species have both gills and lungs. unlike frogs, virtually all salamanders rely on internal fertilization of the eggs. the only male amphibians that possess copulatory structures are the caecilians, so fertilization among salamanders typically involves an elaborate and often prolonged courtship. such a courtship allows the successful transfer of sperm from male to female via a spermatophore. development in many of the most highly evolved salamanders, which are fully terrestrial, occurs during a prolonged egg stage, with the eggs guarded by the mother. during this time, the gilled larval stage is found only within the egg capsule, with the gills being resorbed, and metamorphosis being completed, before hatching. hatchlings thus resemble tiny adults. frogs are amphibians that belong to the order anura ([link]). anurans are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates, with approximately 5,965 species that occur on all of the continents except antarctica. anurans have a body plan that is more specialized for movement. adult frogs use their hind limbs to jump on land. frogs have a number of modifications that allow them to avoid predators, including skin that acts as camouflage. many species of frogs and salamanders also release defensive chemicals from glands in the skin that are poisonous to predators. frog eggs are fertilized externally, and like other amphibians, frogs generally lay their eggs in moist environments. a moist environment is required as eggs lack a shell and thus dehydrate quickly in dry environments. frogs demonstrate a great diversity of parental behaviors, with some species laying many eggs and exhibiting little parental care, to species that carry eggs and tadpoles on their hind legs or backs. the life cycle of frogs, as other amphibians, consists of two distinct stages: the larval stage followed by metamorphosis to an adult stage. the larval stage of a frog, the tadpole, is often a filter-feeding herbivore. tadpoles usually have gills, a lateral line system, long-finned tails, and lack limbs. at the end of the tadpole stage, frogs undergo metamorphosis into the adult form ([link]). during this stage, the gills, tail, and lateral line system disappear, and four limbs develop. the jaws become larger and are suited for carnivorous feeding, and the digestive system transforms into the typical short gut of a predator. an eardrum and air-breathing lungs also develop. these changes during metamorphosis allow the larvae to move onto land in the adult stage. an estimated 185 species comprise caecilians, a group of amphibians that belong to the order apoda. although they are vertebrates, a complete lack of limbs leads to their resemblance to earthworms in appearance. they are adapted for a soil-burrowing or aquatic lifestyle, and they are nearly blind. these animals are found in the tropics of south america, africa, and southern asia. they have vestigial limbs, evidence that they evolved from a legged ancestor. the paleozoic era and the evolution of vertebrates
the climate and geography of earth was vastly different during the paleozoic era, when vertebrates arose, as compared to today. the paleozoic spanned from approximately 542 to 251 million years ago. the landmasses on earth were very different from those of today. laurentia and gondwana were continents located near the equator that subsumed much of the current day landmasses in a different configuration ([link]). at this time, sea levels were very high, probably at a level that hasnt been reached since. as the paleozoic progressed, glaciations created a cool global climate, but conditions warmed near the end of the first half of the paleozoic. during the latter half of the paleozoic, the landmasses began moving together, with the initial formation of a large northern block called laurasia. this contained parts of what is now north america, along with greenland, parts of europe, and siberia. eventually, a single supercontinent, called pangaea, was formed, starting in the latter third of the paleozoic. glaciations then began to affect pangaeas climate, affecting the distribution of vertebrate life. during the early paleozoic, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was much greater than it is today. this may have begun to change later, as land plants became more common. as the roots of land plants began to infiltrate rock and soil began to form, carbon dioxide was drawn out of the atmosphere and became trapped in the rock. this reduced the levels of carbon dioxide and increased the levels of oxygen in the atmosphere, so that by the end of the paleozoic, atmospheric conditions were similar to those of today. as plants became more common through the latter half of the paleozoic, microclimates began to emerge and ecosystems began to change. as plants and ecosystems continued to grow and become more complex, vertebrates moved from the water to land. the presence of shoreline vegetation may have contributed to the movement of vertebrates onto land. one hypothesis suggests that the fins of aquatic vertebrates were used to maneuver through this vegetation, providing a precursor to the movement of fins on land and the development of limbs. the late paleozoic was a time of diversification of vertebrates, as amniotes emerged and became two different lines that gave rise, on one hand, to mammals, and, on the other hand, to reptiles and birds. many marine vertebrates became extinct near the end of the devonian period, which ended about 360 million years ago, and both marine and terrestrial vertebrates were decimated by a mass extinction in the early permian period about 250 million years ago. as tetrapods, most amphibians are characterized by four well-developed limbs, although some species of salamanders and all caecilians are limbless. the most important characteristic of extant amphibians is a moist, permeable skin used for cutaneous respiration. the fossil record provides evidence of amphibian species, now extinct, that arose over 400 million years ago as the first tetrapods. amphibia can be divided into three clades: salamanders (urodela), frogs (anura), and caecilians (apoda). the life cycle of frogs, like the majority of amphibians, consists of two distinct stages: the larval stage and metamorphosis to an adult stage. some species in all orders bypass a free-living larval stage.","[('apoda', 'apodas'), ('amphibian evolution', 'amphibian evolutions'), ('vertebratum', 'vertebratas', 'vertebrata'), ('acanthostega', 'acanthostegas'), ('vertebrate', 'vertebrates'), ('cutaneous respiration', 'cutaneous respirations'), ('vertebrate', 'vertebratess', 'vertebrates'), ('frog', 'frogs'), ('anura', 'anuras'), ('tadpole', 'tadpoles'), ('urodela', 'urodelas'), ('salamander', 'salamanders'), ('caecilian', 'caecilians'), ('amphibian', 'amphibians')]"
150,stax-bio,29,Vertebrates,4,m44689,Reptiles,"the amniotes reptiles, birds, and mammalsare distinguished from amphibians by their terrestrially adapted egg, which is protected by amniotic membranes. the evolution of amniotic membranes meant that the embryos of amniotes were provided with their own aquatic environment, which led to less dependence on water for development and thus allowed the amniotes to branch out into drier environments. this was a significant development that distinguished them from amphibians, which were restricted to moist environments due their shell-less eggs. although the shells of various amniotic species vary significantly, they all allow retention of water. the shells of bird eggs are composed of calcium carbonate and are hard, but fragile. the shells of reptile eggs are leathery and require a moist environment. most mammals do not lay eggs (except for monotremes). instead, the embryo grows within the mothers body; however, even with this internal gestation, amniotic membranes are still present. the amniotic egg is the key characteristic of amniotes. in amniotes that lay eggs, the shell of the egg provides protection for the developing embryo while being permeable enough to allow for the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. the albumin, or egg white, provides the embryo with water and protein, whereas the fattier egg yolk is the energy supply for the embryo, as is the case with the eggs of many other animals, such as amphibians. however, the eggs of amniotes contain three additional extra-embryonic membranes: the chorion, amnion, and allantois ([link]). extra-embryonic membranes are membranes present in amniotic eggs that are not a part of the body of the developing embryo. while the inner amniotic membrane surrounds the embryo itself, the chorion surrounds the embryo and yolk sac. the chorion facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the embryo and the eggs external environment. the amnion protects the embryo from mechanical shock and supports hydration. the allantois stores nitrogenous wastes produced by the embryo and also facilitates respiration. in mammals, membranes that are homologous to the extra-embryonic membranes in eggs are present in the placenta. additional derived characteristics of amniotes include waterproof skin, due to the presence of lipids, and costal (rib) ventilation of the lungs. the first amniotes evolved from amphibian ancestors approximately 340 million years ago during the carboniferous period. the early amniotes diverged into two main lines soon after the first amniotes arose. the initial split was into synapsids and sauropsids. synapsids include all mammals, including extinct mammalian species. synapsids also include therapsids, which were mammal-like reptiles from which mammals evolved. sauropsids include reptiles and birds, and can be further divided into anapsids and diapsids. the key differences between the synapsids, anapsids, and diapsids are the structures of the skull and the number of temporal fenestrae behind each eye ([link]). temporal fenestrae are post-orbital openings in the skull that allow muscles to expand and lengthen. anapsids have no temporal fenestrae, synapsids have one, and diapsids have two. anapsids include extinct organisms and may, based on anatomy, include turtles. however, this is still controversial, and turtles are sometimes classified as diapsids based on molecular evidence. the diapsids include birds and all other living and extinct reptiles. the diapsids diverged into two groups, the archosauromorpha (ancient lizard form) and the lepidosauromorpha (scaly lizard form) during the mesozoic period ([link]). the lepidosaurs include modern lizards, snakes, and tuataras. the archosaurs include modern crocodiles and alligators, and the extinct pterosaurs (winged lizard) and dinosaurs (terrible lizard). clade dinosauria includes birds, which evolved from a branch of dinosaurs. in the past, the most common division of amniotes has been into the classes mammalia, reptilia, and aves. birds are descended, however, from dinosaurs, so this classical scheme results in groups that are not true clades. we will consider birds as a group distinct from reptiles for the purpose of this discussion with the understanding that this does not completely reflect phylogenetic history and relationships. reptiles are tetrapods. limbless reptilessnakes and other squamateshave vestigial limbs and, like caecilians, are classified as tetrapods because they are descended from four-limbed ancestors. reptiles lay eggs enclosed in shells on land. even aquatic reptiles return to the land to lay eggs. they usually reproduce sexually with internal fertilization. some species display ovoviviparity, with the eggs remaining in the mothers body until they are ready to hatch. other species are viviparous, with the offspring born alive. one of the key adaptations that permitted reptiles to live on land was the development of their scaly skin, containing the protein keratin and waxy lipids, which reduced water loss from the skin. this occlusive skin means that reptiles cannot use their skin for respiration, like amphibians, and thus all breathe with lungs. reptiles are ectotherms, animals whose main source of body heat comes from the environment. this is in contrast to endotherms, which use heat produced by metabolism to regulate body temperature. in addition to being ectothermic, reptiles are categorized as poikilotherms, or animals whose body temperatures vary rather than remain stable. reptiles have behavioral adaptations to help regulate body temperature, such as basking in sunny places to warm up and finding shady spots or going underground to cool down. the advantage of ectothermy is that metabolic energy from food is not required to heat the body; therefore, reptiles can survive on about 10 percent of the calories required by a similarly sized endotherm.  in cold weather, some reptiles such as the garter snake brumate. brumation is similar to hibernation in that the animal becomes less active and can go for long periods without eating, but differs from hibernation in that brumating reptiles are not asleep or living off fat reserves. rather, their metabolism is slowed in response to cold temperatures, and the animal is very sluggish. reptiles originated approximately 300 million years ago during the carboniferous period. one of the oldest known amniotes is casineria, which had both amphibian and reptilian characteristics. one of the earliest undisputed reptiles was hylonomus. soon after the first amniotes appeared, they diverged into three groupssynapsids, anapsids, and diapsidsduring the permian period. the permian period also saw a second major divergence of diapsid reptiles into archosaurs (predecessors of crocodilians and dinosaurs) and lepidosaurs (predecessors of snakes and lizards). these groups remained inconspicuous until the triassic period, when the archosaurs became the dominant terrestrial group due to the extinction of large-bodied anapsids and synapsids during the permian-triassic extinction. about 250 million years ago, archosaurs radiated into the dinosaurs and the pterosaurs. although they are sometimes mistakenly called dinosaurs, the pterosaurs were distinct from true dinosaurs ([link]). pterosaurs had a number of adaptations that allowed for flight, including hollow bones (birds also exhibit hollow bones, a case of convergent evolution). their wings were formed by membranes of skin that attached to the long, fourth finger of each arm and extended along the body to the legs. the dinosaurs were a diverse group of terrestrial reptiles with more than 1,000 species identified to date. paleontologists continue to discover new species of dinosaurs. some dinosaurs were quadrupeds ([link]); others were bipeds. some were carnivorous, whereas others were herbivorous. dinosaurs laid eggs, and a number of nests containing fossilized eggs have been found. it is not known whether dinosaurs were endotherms or ectotherms. however, given that modern birds are endothermic, the dinosaurs that served as ancestors to birds likely were endothermic as well. some fossil evidence exists for dinosaurian parental care, and comparative biology supports this hypothesis since the archosaur birds and crocodilians display parental care. dinosaurs dominated the mesozoic era, which was known as the age of reptiles. the dominance of dinosaurs lasted until the end of the cretaceous, the last period of the mesozoic era. the cretaceous-tertiary extinction resulted in the loss of most of the large-bodied animals of the mesozoic era. birds are the only living descendants of one of the major clades of dinosaurs. class reptilia includes many diverse species that are classified into four living clades. these are the 25 species of crocodilia, 2 species of sphenodontia, approximately 9,200 squamata species, and the testudines, with about 325 species. crocodilia (small lizard) arose with a distinct lineage by the middle triassic; extant species include alligators, crocodiles, and caimans. crocodilians ([link]) live throughout the tropics and subtropics of africa, south america, southern florida, asia, and australia. they are found in freshwater, saltwater, and brackish habitats, such as rivers and lakes, and spend most of their time in water. some species are able to move on land due to their semi-erect posture. sphenodontia (wedge tooth) arose in the mesozoic era and includes only one living genus, tuatara, comprising two species that are found in new zealand ([link]). tuataras measure up to 80 centimeters and weigh about 1 kilogram. although quite lizard-like in gross appearance, several unique features of the skull and jaws clearly define them and distinguish the group from the squamates. squamata (scaly) arose in the late permian, and extant species include lizards and snakes. both are found on all continents except antarctica. lizards and snakes are most closely related to tuataras, both groups having evolved from a lepidosaurian ancestor. squamata is the largest extant clade of reptiles ([link]). most lizards differ from snakes by having four limbs, although these have been variously lost or significantly reduced in at least 60 lineages. snakes lack eyelids and external ears, which are present in lizards. lizard species range in size from chameleons and geckos, which are a few centimeters in length, to the komodo dragon, which is about 3 meters in length. most lizards are carnivorous, but some large species, such as iguanas, are herbivores. snakes are thought to have descended from either burrowing lizards or aquatic lizards over 100 million years ago ([link]). snakes comprise about 3,000 species and are found on every continent except antarctica. they range in size from 10 centimeter-long thread snakes to 10 meter-long pythons and anacondas. all snakes are carnivorous and eat small animals, birds, eggs, fish, and insects. the snake body form is so specialized that, in its general morphology, a snake is a snake. their specializations all point to snakes having evolved to feed on relatively large prey (even though some current species have reversed this trend). although variations exist, most snakes have a skull that is very flexible, involving eight rotational joints. they also differ from other squamates by having mandibles (lower jaws) without either bony or ligamentous attachment anteriorly. having this connection via skin and muscle allows for great expansion of the gape and independent motion of the two sidesboth advantages in swallowing big items. turtles are members of the clade testudines (having a shell) ([link]). turtles are characterized by a bony or cartilaginous shell. the shell consists of the ventral surface called the plastron and the dorsal surface called the carapace, which develops from the ribs. the plastron is made of scutes or plates; the scutes can be used to differentiate species of turtles. the two clades of turtles are most easily recognized by how they retract their necks. the dominant group, which includes all north american species, retracts its neck in a vertical s-curve. turtles in the less speciose clade retract the neck with a horizontal curve. turtles arose approximately 200 million years ago, predating crocodiles, lizards, and snakes. similar to other reptiles, turtles are ectotherms. they lay eggs on land, although many species live in or near water. none exhibit parental care. turtles range in size from the speckled padloper tortoise at 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) to the leatherback sea turtle at 200 centimeters (over 6 feet). the term turtle is sometimes used to describe only those species of testudines that live in the sea, with the terms tortoise and terrapin used to refer to species that live on land and in fresh water, respectively. the amniotes are distinguished from amphibians by the presence of a terrestrially adapted egg protected by amniotic membranes. the amniotes include reptiles, birds, and mammals. the early amniotes diverged into two main lines soon after the first amniotes arose. the initial split was into synapsids (mammals) and sauropsids. sauropsids can be further divided into anapsids (turtles) and diapsids (birds and reptiles). reptiles are tetrapods either having four limbs or descending from such. limbless reptiles (snakes) are classified as tetrapods, as they are descended from four-limbed organisms. one of the key adaptations that permitted reptiles to live on land was the development of scaly skin containing the protein keratin, which prevented water loss from the skin. reptilia includes four living clades: crocodilia (crocodiles and alligators), sphenodontia (tuataras), squamata (lizards and snakes), and testudines (turtles).","[('amniote evolution', 'amniote evolutions'), ('amnion', 'amnions'), ('sphenodontium', 'sphenodontias', 'sphenodontia'), ('allantoi', 'allantois'), ('reptile', 'reptiles'), ('brumation', 'brumations'), ('crocodilium', 'crocodilias', 'crocodilia'), ('sauropsid', 'sauropsids'), ('amniote', 'amniotes'), ('vertebratum', 'vertebratas', 'vertebrata'), ('archosaur', 'archosaurs'), ('hylonomu', 'hylonomuss', 'hylonomus'), ('vertebrate', 'vertebrates'), ('vertebrate', 'vertebratess', 'vertebrates'), ('casinerium', 'casinerias', 'casineria'), ('temporal fenestra', 'temporal fenestraes', 'temporal fenestrae'), ('reptile characteristic', 'reptile characteristicss', 'reptile characteristics'), ('lepidosaur', 'lepidosaurs'), ('chorion', 'chorions'), ('squamatum', 'squamatas', 'squamata'), ('pterosaur', 'pterosaurs'), ('testudine', 'testudiness', 'testudines'), ('anapsid', 'anapsids'), ('synapsid', 'synapsids')]"
151,stax-bio,29,Vertebrates,5,m44694,Birds,"the most obvious characteristic that sets birds apart from other modern vertebrates is the presence of feathers, which are modified scales. while vertebrates like bats fly without feathers, birds rely on feathers and wings, along with other modifications of body structure and physiology, for flight. birds are endothermic, and because they fly, they require large amounts of energy, necessitating a high metabolic rate. like mammals, which are also endothermic, birds have an insulating covering that keeps heat in the body: feathers. specialized feathers called down feathers are especially insulating, trapping air in spaces between each feather to decrease the rate of heat loss. certain parts of a birds body are covered in down feathers, and the base of other feathers have a downy portion, whereas newly hatched birds are covered in down. feathers not only act as insulation but also allow for flight, enabling the lift and thrust necessary to become airborne. the feathers on a wing are flexible, so the collective feathers move and separate as air moves through them, reducing the drag on the wing. flight feathers are asymmetrical, which affects airflow over them and provides some of the lifting and thrusting force required for flight ([link]). two types of flight feathers are found on the wings, primary feathers and secondary feathers. primary feathers are located at the tip of the wing and provide thrust. secondary feathers are located closer to the body, attach to the forearm portion of the wing and provide lift. contour feathers are the feathers found on the body, and they help reduce drag produced by wind resistance during flight. they create a smooth, aerodynamic surface so that air moves smoothly over the birds body, allowing for efficient flight. flapping of the entire wing occurs primarily through the actions of the chest muscles, the pectoralis and the supracoracoideus. these muscles are highly developed in birds and account for a higher percentage of body mass than in most mammals. these attach to a blade-shaped keel, like that of a boat, located on the sternum. the sternum of birds is larger than that of other vertebrates, which accommodates the large muscles required to generate enough upward force to generate lift with the flapping of the wings. another skeletal modification found in most birds is the fusion of the two clavicles (collarbones), forming the furcula or wishbone. the furcula is flexible enough to bend and provide support to the shoulder girdle during flapping. an important requirement of flight is a low body weight. as body weight increases, the muscle output required for flying increases. the largest living bird is the ostrich, and while it is much smaller than the largest mammals, it is flightless. for birds that do fly, reduction in body weight makes flight easier. several modifications are found in birds to reduce body weight, including pneumatization of bones. pneumatic bones are bones that are hollow, rather than filled with tissue ([link]). they contain air spaces that are sometimes connected to air sacs, and they have struts of bone to provide structural reinforcement. pneumatic bones are not found in all birds, and they are more extensive in large birds than in small birds. not all bones of the skeleton are pneumatic, although the skulls of almost all birds are. other modifications that reduce weight include the lack of a urinary bladder. birds possess a cloaca, a structure that allows water to be reabsorbed from waste back into the bloodstream. uric acid is not expelled as a liquid but is concentrated into urate salts, which are expelled along with fecal matter. in this way, water is not held in the urinary bladder, which would increase body weight. most bird species only possess one ovary rather than two, further reducing body mass. the air sacs that extend into bones to form pneumatic bones also join with the lungs and function in respiration. unlike mammalian lungs in which air flows in two directions, as it is breathed in and out, airflow through bird lungs travels in one direction ([link]). air sacs allow for this unidirectional airflow, which also creates a cross-current exchange system with the blood. in a cross-current or counter-current system, the air flows in one direction and the blood flows in the opposite direction, creating a very efficient means of gas exchange. the evolutionary history of birds is still somewhat unclear. due to the fragility of bird bones, they do not fossilize as well as other vertebrates. birds are diapsids, meaning they have two fenestrations or openings in their skulls. birds belong to a group of diapsids called the archosaurs, which also includes crocodiles and dinosaurs. it is commonly accepted that birds evolved from dinosaurs. dinosaurs (including birds) are further subdivided into two groups, the saurischia (lizard like) and the ornithischia (bird like). despite the names of these groups, it was not the bird-like dinosaurs that gave rise to modern birds. rather, saurischia diverged into two groups: one included the long-necked herbivorous dinosaurs, such as apatosaurus. the second group, bipedal predators called theropods, includes birds. this course of evolution is suggested by similarities between theropod fossils and birds, specifically in the structure of the hip and wrist bones, as well as the presence of the wishbone, formed by the fusing of the clavicles. one important fossil of an animal intermediate to dinosaurs and birds is archaeopteryx, which is from the jurassic period ([link]). archaeopteryx is important in establishing the relationship between birds and dinosaurs, because it is an intermediate fossil, meaning it has characteristics of both dinosaurs and birds. some scientists propose classifying it as a bird, but others prefer to classify it as a dinosaur. the fossilized skeleton of archaeopteryx looks like that of a dinosaur, and it had teeth whereas birds do not, but it also had feathers modified for flight, a trait associated only with birds among modern animals. fossils of older feathered dinosaurs exist, but the feathers do not have the characteristics of flight feathers. it is still unclear exactly how flight evolved in birds. two main theories exist, the arboreal (tree) hypothesis and the terrestrial (land) hypothesis. the arboreal hypothesis posits that tree-dwelling precursors to modern birds jumped from branch to branch using their feathers for gliding before becoming fully capable of flapping flight. in contrast to this, the terrestrial hypothesis holds that running was the stimulus for flight, as wings could be used to improve running and then became used for flapping flight. like the question of how flight evolved, the question of how endothermy evolved in birds still is unanswered. feathers provide insulation, but this is only beneficial if body heat is being produced internally. similarly, internal heat production is only viable if insulation is present to retain that heat. it has been suggested that one or the otherfeathers or endothermyevolved in response to some other selective pressure. during the cretaceous period, a group known as the enantiornithes was the dominant bird type ([link]). enantiornithes means opposite birds, which refers to the fact that certain bones of the feet are joined differently than the way the bones are joined in modern birds. these birds formed an evolutionary line separate from modern birds, and they did not survive past the cretaceous. along with the enantiornithes, ornithurae birds (the evolutionary line that includes modern birds) were also present in the cretaceous. after the extinction of enantiornithes, modern birds became the dominant bird, with a large radiation occurring during the cenozoic era. referred to as neornithes (new birds), modern birds are now classified into two groups, the paleognathae (old jaw) or ratites, a group of flightless birds including ostriches, emus, rheas, and kiwis, and the neognathae (new jaw), which includes all other birds. veterinarian
veterinarians treat diseases, disorders, and injuries in animals, primarily vertebrates. they treat pets, livestock, and animals in zoos and laboratories. veterinarians usually treat dogs and cats, but also treat birds, reptiles, rabbits, and other animals that are kept as pets. veterinarians that work with farms and ranches treat pigs, goats, cows, sheep, and horses. veterinarians are required to complete a degree in veterinary medicine, which includes taking courses in animal physiology, anatomy, microbiology, and pathology, among many other courses. the physiology and biochemistry of different vertebrate species differ greatly. veterinarians are also trained to perform surgery on many different vertebrate species, which requires an understanding of the vastly different anatomies of various species. for example, the stomach of ruminants like cows has four compartments versus one compartment for non-ruminants. birds also have unique anatomical adaptations that allow for flight. some veterinarians conduct research in academic settings, broadening our knowledge of animals and medical science. one area of research involves understanding the transmission of animal diseases to humans, called zoonotic diseases. for example, one area of great concern is the transmission of the avian flu virus to humans. one type of avian flu virus, h5n1, is a highly pathogenic strain that has been spreading in birds in asia, europe, africa, and the middle east. although the virus does not cross over easily to humans, there have been cases of bird-to-human transmission. more research is needed to understand how this virus can cross the species barrier and how its spread can be prevented. birds are endothermic, meaning they produce their own body heat and regulate their internal temperature independently of the external temperature. feathers not only act as insulation but also allow for flight, providing lift with secondary feathers and thrust with primary feathers. pneumatic bones are bones that are hollow rather than filled with tissue, containing air spaces that are sometimes connected to air sacs. airflow through bird lungs travels in one direction, creating a cross-current exchange with the blood. birds are diapsids and belong to a group called the archosaurs. birds are thought to have evolved from theropod dinosaurs. the oldest known fossil of a bird is that of archaeopteryx, which is from the jurassic period. modern birds are now classified into two groups, paleognathae and neognathae.","[('secondary feather', 'secondary feathers'), ('bird evolution', 'bird evolutions'), ('paleognatha', 'paleognathaes', 'paleognathae'), ('furcula', 'furculas'), ('bird', 'birds'), ('veterinarian', 'veterinarians'), ('pneumatic bone', 'pneumatic bones'), ('flight feather', 'flight feathers'), ('vertebratum', 'vertebratas', 'vertebrata'), ('archaeopteryx', 'archaeopteryxes'), ('therapod', 'therapods'), ('vertebrate', 'vertebratess', 'vertebrates'), ('down feather', 'down feathers'), ('primary feather', 'primary feathers'), ('neornith', 'neorniths'), ('vertebrate', 'vertebrates'), ('enantiornithe', 'enantiornithess', 'enantiornithes'), ('contmy feather', 'contmy feathers'), ('neognatha', 'neognathaes', 'neognathae')]"
152,stax-bio,29,Vertebrates,6,m44692,Mammals,"mammals are vertebrates that possess hair and mammary glands. several other characteristics are distinctive to mammals, including certain features of the jaw, skeleton, integument, and internal anatomy. modern mammals belong to three clades: monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians (or placental mammals). the presence of hair is one of the most obvious signs of a mammal. although it is not very extensive on certain species, such as whales, hair has many important functions for mammals. mammals are endothermic, and hair provides insulation to retain heat generated by metabolic work. hair traps a layer of air close to the body, retaining heat. along with insulation, hair can serve as a sensory mechanism via specialized hairs called vibrissae, better known as whiskers. these attach to nerves that transmit information about sensation, which is particularly useful to nocturnal or burrowing mammals. hair can also provide protective coloration or be part of social signaling, such as when an animals hair stands on end. mammalian integument, or skin, includes secretory glands with various functions. sebaceous glands produce a lipid mixture called sebum that is secreted onto the hair and skin for water resistance and lubrication. sebaceous glands are located over most of the body. eccrine glands produce sweat, or perspiration, which is mainly composed of water. in most mammals, eccrine glands are limited to certain areas of the body, and some mammals do not possess them at all. however, in primates, especially humans, sweat figures prominently in thermoregulation, regulating the body through evaporative cooling. sweat glands are located over most of the body surface in primates. apocrine glands, or scent glands, secrete substances that are used for chemical communication, such as in skunks. mammary glands produce milk that is used to feed newborns. while male monotremes and eutherians possess mammary glands, male marsupials do not. mammary glands likely are modified sebaceous or eccrine glands, but their evolutionary origin is not entirely clear. the skeletal system of mammals possesses many unique features. the lower jaw of mammals consists of only one bone, the dentary. the jaws of other vertebrates are composed of more than one bone. in mammals, the dentary bone joins the skull at the squamosal bone, while in other vertebrates, the quadrate bone of the jaw joins with the articular bone of the skull. these bones are present in mammals, but they have been modified to function in hearing and form bones in the middle ear ([link]). other vertebrates possess only one middle ear bone, the stapes. mammals have three: the malleus, incus, and stapes. the malleus originated from the articular bone, whereas the incus originated from the quadrate bone. this arrangement of jaw and ear bones aids in distinguishing fossil mammals from fossils of other synapsids. the adductor muscle that closes the jaw is composed of two muscles in mammals: the temporalis and the masseter. these allow side-to-side movement of the jaw, making chewing possible, which is unique to mammals. most mammals have heterodont teeth, meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth. most mammals are diphyodonts, meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: deciduous or baby teeth, and permanent teeth. other vertebrates are polyphyodonts, that is, their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life. mammals, like birds, possess a four-chambered heart. mammals also have a specialized group of cardiac fibers located in the walls of their right atrium called the sinoatrial node, or pacemaker, which determines the rate at which the heart beats. mammalian erythrocytes (red blood cells) do not have nuclei, whereas the erythrocytes of other vertebrates are nucleated. the kidneys of mammals have a portion of the nephron called the loop of henle or nephritic loop, which allows mammals to produce urine with a high concentration of solutes, higher than that of the blood. mammals lack a renal portal system, which is a system of veins that moves blood from the hind or lower limbs and region of the tail to the kidneys. renal portal systems are present in all other vertebrates except jawless fishes. a urinary bladder is present in all mammals. mammalian brains have certain characteristics that differ from other vertebrates. in some, but not all mammals, the cerebral cortex, the outermost part of the cerebrum, is highly folded, allowing for a greater surface area than is possible with a smooth cortex. the optic lobes, located in the midbrain, are divided into two parts in mammals, whereas other vertebrates possess a single, undivided lobe. eutherian mammals also possess a specialized structure that links the two cerebral hemispheres, called the corpus callosum. mammals are synapsids, meaning they have a single opening in the skull. they are the only living synapsids, as earlier forms became extinct by the jurassic period. the early non-mammalian synapsids can be divided into two groups, the pelycosaurs and the therapsids. within the therapsids, a group called the cynodonts are thought to be the ancestors of mammals ([link]). a key characteristic of synapsids is endothermy, rather than the ectothermy seen in most other vertebrates. the increased metabolic rate required to internally modify body temperature went hand in hand with changes to certain skeletal structures. the later synapsids, which had more evolved characteristics unique to mammals, possess cheeks for holding food and heterodont teeth, which are specialized for chewing, mechanically breaking down food to speed digestion and releasing the energy needed to produce heat. chewing also requires the ability to chew and breathe at the same time, which is facilitated by the presence of a secondary palate. a secondary palate separates the area of the mouth where chewing occurs from the area above where respiration occurs, allowing breathing to proceed uninterrupted during chewing. a secondary palate is not found in pelycosaurs but is present in cynodonts and mammals. the jawbone also shows changes from early synapsids to later ones. the zygomatic arch, or cheekbone, is present in mammals and advanced therapsids such as cynodonts, but is not present in pelycosaurs. the presence of the zygomatic arch suggests the presence of the masseter muscle, which closes the jaw and functions in chewing. in the appendicular skeleton, the shoulder girdle of therian mammals is modified from that of other vertebrates in that it does not possess a procoracoid bone or an interclavicle, and the scapula is the dominant bone. mammals evolved from therapsids in the late triassic period, as the earliest known mammal fossils are from the early jurassic period, some 205 million years ago. early mammals were small, about the size of a small rodent. mammals first began to diversify in the mesozoic era, from the jurassic to the cretaceous periods, although most of these mammals were extinct by the end of the mesozoic. during the cretaceous period, another radiation of mammals began and continued through the cenozoic era, about 65 million years ago. the eutherians, or placental mammals, and the marsupials together comprise the clade of therian mammals. monotremes, or metatherians, form their sister clade. there are three living species of monotremes: the platypus and two species of echidnas, or spiny anteaters. the leathery-beaked platypus belongs to the family ornithorhynchidae (bird beak), whereas echidnas belong to the family tachyglossidae (sticky tongue) ([link]). the platypus and one species of echidna are found in australia, and the other species of echidna is found in new guinea. monotremes are unique among mammals as they lay eggs, rather than giving birth to live young. the shells of their eggs are not like the hard shells of birds, but are a leathery shell, similar to the shells of reptile eggs. monotremes have no teeth. marsupials are found primarily in australia, though the opossum is found in north america. australian marsupials include the kangaroo, koala, bandicoot, tasmanian devil ([link]), and several other species. most species of marsupials possess a pouch in which the very premature young reside after birth, receiving milk and continuing to develop. marsupials differ from eutherians in that there is a less complex placental connection: the young are born at an extremely early age and latch onto the nipple within the pouch. eutherians are the most widespread of the mammals, occurring throughout the world. there are 18 to 20 orders of placental mammals. some examples are insectivora, the insect eaters; edentata, the toothless anteaters; rodentia, the rodents; cetacea, the aquatic mammals including whales; carnivora, carnivorous mammals including dogs, cats, and bears; and primates, which includes humans. eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals because all species possess a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother, allowing for gas, fluid, and nutrient exchange. while other mammals possess a less complex placenta or briefly have a placenta, all eutherians possess a complex placenta during gestation. mammals in general are vertebrates that possess hair and mammary glands. the mammalian integument includes various secretory glands, including sebaceous glands, eccrine glands, apocrine glands, and mammary glands. mammals are synapsids, meaning that they have a single opening in the skull. a key characteristic of synapsids is endothermy rather than the ectothermy seen in other vertebrates. mammals probably evolved from therapsids in the late triassic period, as the earliest known mammal fossils are from the early jurassic period. there are three groups of mammals living today: monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians. monotremes are unique among mammals as they lay eggs, rather than giving birth to young. eutherian mammals are sometimes called placental mammals, because all species possess a complex placenta that connects a fetus to the mother, allowing for gas, fluid, and nutrient exchange.","[('heterodont', 'heterodonts'), ('ornithorhynchida', 'ornithorhynchidaes',

153,stax-bio,29,Vertebrates,7,m44696,The Evolution of Primates,"order primates of class mammalia includes lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans. non-human primates live primarily in the tropical or subtropical regions of south america, africa, and asia. they range in size from the mouse lemur at 30 grams (1 ounce) to the mountain gorilla at 200 kilograms (441 pounds). the characteristics and evolution of primates is of particular interest to us as it allows us to understand the evolution of our own species. all primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees, as they all descended from tree-dwellers. this arboreal heritage of primates has resulted in hands and feet that are adapted for brachiation, or climbing and swinging through trees. these adaptations include, but are not limited to: 1) a rotating shoulder joint, 2) a big toe that is widely separated from the other toes and thumbs, which are widely separated from fingers (except humans), which allow for gripping branches, 3) stereoscopic vision, two overlapping fields of vision from the eyes, which allows for the perception of depth and gauging distance. other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of most other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one offspring per pregnancy, and a trend toward holding the body upright. order primates is divided into two groups: prosimians and anthropoids. prosimians include the bush babies of africa, the lemurs of madagascar, and the lorises, pottos, and tarsiers of southeast asia. anthropoids include monkeys, apes, and humans. in general, prosimians tend to be nocturnal (in contrast to diurnal anthropoids) and exhibit a smaller size and smaller brain than anthropoids. the first primate-like mammals are referred to as proto-primates. they were roughly similar to squirrels and tree shrews in size and appearance. the existing fossil evidence (mostly from north africa) is very fragmented. these proto-primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil evidence becomes available. the oldest known primate-like mammals with a relatively robust fossil record is plesiadapis (although some researchers do not agree that plesiadapis was a proto-primate). fossils of this primate have been dated to approximately 55 million years ago. plesiadapiforms were proto-primates that had some features of the teeth and skeleton in common with true primates. they were found in north america and europe in the cenozoic and went extinct by the end of the eocene. the first true primates were found in north america, europe, asia, and africa in the eocene epoch. these early primates resembled present-day prosimians such as lemurs. evolutionary changes continued in these early primates, with larger brains and eyes, and smaller muzzles being the trend. by the end of the eocene epoch, many of the early prosimian species went extinct due either to cooler temperatures or competition from the first monkeys. anthropoid monkeys evolved from prosimians during the oligocene epoch. by 40 million years ago, evidence indicates that monkeys were present in the new world (south america) and the old world (africa and asia). new world monkeys are also called platyrrhinia reference to their broad noses ([link]). old world monkeys are called catarrhinia reference to their narrow noses. there is still quite a bit of uncertainty about the origins of the new world monkeys. at the time the platyrrhines arose, the continents of south american and africa had drifted apart. therefore, it is thought that monkeys arose in the old world and reached the new world either by drifting on log rafts or by crossing land bridges. due to this reproductive isolation, new world monkeys and old world monkeys underwent separate adaptive radiations over millions of years. the new world monkeys are all arboreal, whereas old world monkeys include arboreal and ground-dwelling species. apes evolved from the catarrhines in africa midway through the cenozoic, approximately 25 million years ago. apes are generally larger than monkeys and they do not possess a tail. all apes are capable of moving through trees, although many species spend most their time on the ground. apes are more intelligent than monkeys, and they have relatively larger brains proportionate to body size. the apes are divided into two groups. the lesser apes comprise the family hylobatidae, including gibbons and siamangs. the great apes include the genera pan (chimpanzees and bonobos) ([link]a), gorilla (gorillas), pongo (orangutans), and homo (humans) ([link]b). the very arboreal gibbons are smaller than the great apes; they have low sexual dimorphism (that is, the sexes are not markedly different in size); and they have relatively longer arms used for swinging through trees. the family hominidae of order primates includes the hominoids: the great apes ([link]). evidence from the fossil record and from a comparison of human and chimpanzee dna suggests that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common hominoid ancestor approximately 6 million years ago. several species evolved from the evolutionary branch that includes humans, although our species is the only surviving member. the term hominin is used to refer to those species that evolved after this split of the primate line, thereby designating species that are more closely related to humans than to chimpanzees. hominins were predominantly bipedal and include those groups that likely gave rise to our speciesincluding australopithecus, homo habilis, and homo erectusand those non-ancestral groups that can be considered cousins of modern humans, such as neanderthals. determining the true lines of descent in hominins is difficult. in years past, when relatively few hominin fossils had been recovered, some scientists believed that considering them in order, from oldest to youngest, would demonstrate the course of evolution from early hominins to modern humans. in the past several years, however, many new fossils have been found, and it is clear that there was often more than one species alive at any one time and that many of the fossils found (and species named) represent hominin species that died out and are not ancestral to modern humans. three species of very early hominids have made news in the past few years. the oldest of these, sahelanthropus tchadensis, has been dated to nearly 7 million years ago. there is a single specimen of this genus, a skull that was a surface find in chad. the fossil, informally called toumai, is a mosaic of primitive and evolved characteristics, and it is unclear how this fossil fits with the picture given by molecular data, namely that the line leading to modern humans and modern chimpanzees apparently bifurcated about 6 million years ago. it is not thought at this time that this species was an ancestor of modern humans. a second, younger species, orrorin tugenensis, is also a relatively recent discovery, found in 2000. there are several specimens of orrorin. it is not known whether orrorin was a human ancestor, but this possibility has not been ruled out. some features of orrorin are more similar to those of modern humans than are the australopiths, although orrorin is much older. a third genus, ardipithecus, was discovered in the 1990s, and the scientists who discovered the first fossil found that some other scientists did not believe the organism to be a biped (thus, it would not be considered a hominid). in the intervening years, several more specimens of ardipithecus, classified as two different species, demonstrated that the organism was bipedal. again, the status of this genus as a human ancestor is uncertain. australopithecus (southern ape) is a genus of hominin that evolved in eastern africa approximately 4 million years ago and went extinct about 2 million years ago. this genus is of particular interest to us as it is thought that our genus, genus homo, evolved from a common ancestor shared with australopithecus about 2 million years ago (after likely passing through some transitional states). australopithecus had a number of characteristics that were more similar to the great apes than to modern humans. for example, sexual dimorphism was more exaggerated than in modern humans. males were up to 50 percent larger than females, a ratio that is similar to that seen in modern gorillas and orangutans. in contrast, modern human males are approximately 15 to 20 percent larger than females. the brain size of australopithecus relative to its body mass was also smaller than modern humans and more similar to that seen in the great apes. a key feature that australopithecus had in common with modern humans was bipedalism, although it is likely that australopithecus also spent time in trees. hominin footprints, similar to those of modern humans, were found in laetoli, tanzania and dated to 3.6 million years ago. they showed that hominins at the time of australopithecus were walking upright. there were a number of australopithecus species, which are often referred to as australopiths. australopithecus anamensis lived about 4.2 million years ago. more is known about another early species, australopithecus afarensis, which lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. this species demonstrates a trend in human evolution: the reduction of the dentition and jaw in size. a. afarensis ([link]) had smaller canines and molars compared to apes, but these were larger than those of modern humans. its brain size was 380450 cubic centimeters, approximately the size of a modern chimpanzee brain. it also had prognathic jaws, which is a relatively longer jaw than that of modern humans. in the mid-1970s, the fossil of an adult female a. afarensis was found in the afar region of ethiopia and dated to 3.24 million years ago ([link]). the fossil, which is informally called lucy, is significant because it was the most complete australopith fossil found, with 40 percent of the skeleton recovered. australopithecus africanus lived between 2 and 3 million years ago. it had a slender build and was bipedal, but had robust arm bones and, like other early hominids, may have spent significant time in trees. its brain was larger than that of a. afarensis at 500 cubic centimeters, which is slightly less than one-third the size of modern human brains. two other species, australopithecus bahrelghazali and australopithecus garhi, have been added to the roster of australopiths in recent years. the australopiths had a relatively slender build and teeth that were suited for soft food. in the past several years, fossils of hominids of a different body type have been found and dated to approximately 2.5 million years ago. these hominids, of the genus paranthropus, were muscular, stood 1.3-1.4 meters tall, and had large grinding teeth. their molars showed heavy wear, suggesting that they had a coarse and fibrous vegetarian diet as opposed to the partially carnivorous diet of the australopiths. paranthropus includes paranthropus robustus of south africa, and paranthropus aethiopicus and paranthropus boisei of east africa. the hominids in this genus went extinct more than 1 million years ago and are not thought to be ancestral to modern humans, but rather members of an evolutionary branch on the hominin tree that left no descendants. the human genus, homo, first appeared between 2.5 and 3 million years ago. for many years, fossils of a species called h. habilis were the oldest examples in the genus homo, but in 2010, a new species called homo gautengensis was discovered and may be older. compared to a. africanus, h. habilis had a number of features more similar to modern humans. h. habilis had a jaw that was less prognathic than the australopiths and a larger brain, at 600750 cubic centimeters. however, h. habilis retained some features of older hominin species, such as long arms. the name h. habilis means handy man, which is a reference to the stone tools that have been found with its remains. watch this video about smithsonian paleontologist briana pobiner explaining the link between hominin eating of meat and evolutionary trends.

 h. erectus appeared approximately 1.8 million years ago ([link]). it is believed to have originated in east africa and was the first hominin species to migrate out of africa. fossils of h. erectus have been found in india, china, java, and europe, and were known in the past as java man or peking man. h. erectus had a number of features that were more similar to modern humans than those of h. habilis. h. erectus was larger in size than earlier hominins, reaching heights up to 1.85 meters and weighing up to 65 kilograms, which are sizes similar to those of modern humans. its degree of sexual dimorphism was less than earlier species, with males being 20 to 30 percent larger than females, which is close to the size difference seen in our species. h. erectus had a larger brain than earlier species at 7751,100 cubic centimeters, which compares to the 1,1301,260 cubic centimeters seen in modern human brains. h. erectus also had a nose with downward-facing nostrils similar to modern humans, rather than the forward facing nostrils found in other primates. longer, downward-facing nostrils allow for the warming of cold air before it enters the lungs and may have been an adaptation to colder climates. artifacts found with fossils of h. erectus suggest that it was the first hominin to use fire, hunt, and have a home base. h. erectus is generally thought to have lived until about 50,000 years ago. a number of species, sometimes called archaic homo sapiens, apparently evolved from h. erectus starting about 500,000 years ago. these species include homo heidelbergensis, homo rhodesiensis, and homo neanderthalensis. these archaic h. sapiens had a brain size similar to that of modern humans, averaging 1,2001,400 cubic centimeters. they differed from modern humans by having a thick skull, a prominent brow ridge, and a receding chin. some of these species survived until 30,00010,000 years ago, overlapping with modern humans ([link]). there is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or homo sapiens sapiens. as discussed earlier, h. erectus migrated out of africa and into asia and europe in the first major wave of migration about 1.5 million years ago. it is thought that modern humans arose in africa from h. erectus and migrated out of africa about 100,000 years ago in a second major migration wave. then, modern humans replaced h. erectus species that had migrated into asia and europe in the first wave. this evolutionary timeline is supported by molecular evidence. one approach to studying the origins of modern humans is to examine mitochondrial dna (mtdna) from populations around the world. because a fetus develops from an egg containing its mothers mitochondria (which have their own, non-nuclear dna), mtdna is passed entirely through the maternal line. mutations in mtdna can now be used to estimate the timeline of genetic divergence. the resulting evidence suggests that all modern humans have mtdna inherited from a common ancestor that lived in africa about 160,000 years ago. another approach to the molecular understanding of human evolution is to examine the y chromosome, which is passed from father to son. this evidence suggests that all men today inherited a y chromosome from a male that lived in africa about 140,000 years ago. all primate species possess adaptations for climbing trees, as they all probably descended from tree-dwellers, although not all species are arboreal. other characteristics of primates are brains that are larger than those of other mammals, claws that have been modified into flattened nails, typically only one young per pregnancy, stereoscopic vision, and a trend toward holding the body upright. primates are divided into two groups: prosimians and anthropoids. monkeys evolved from prosimians during the oligocene epoch. apes evolved from catarrhines in africa during the miocene epoch. apes are divided into the lesser apes and the greater apes. hominins include those groups that gave rise to our species, such as australopithecus and h. erectus, and those groups that can be considered cousins of humans, such as neanderthals. fossil evidence shows that hominins at the time of australopithecus were walking upright, the first evidence of bipedal hominins. a number of species, sometimes called archaic h. sapiens, evolved from h. erectus approximately 500,000 years ago. there is considerable debate about the origins of anatomically modern humans or h. sapiens sapiens.","[('primate evolution', 'primate evolutions'), ('cararrhini',

154,stax-bio,30,Plant Form and Physiology,0,m44698,Introduction,"plants are as essential to human existence as land, water, and air. without plants, our day-to-day lives would be impossible because without oxygen from photosynthesis, aerobic life cannot be sustained. from providing food and shelter to serving as a source of medicines, oils, perfumes, and industrial products, plants provide humans with numerous valuable resources. when you think of plants, most of the organisms that come to mind are vascular plants. these plants have tissues that conduct food and water, and they have seeds. seed plants are divided into gymnosperms and angiosperms. gymnosperms include the needle-leaved conifersspruce, fir, and pineas well as less familiar plants, such as ginkgos and cycads. their seeds are not enclosed by a fleshy fruit. angiosperms, also called flowering plants, constitute the majority of seed plants. they include broadleaved trees (such as maple, oak, and elm), vegetables (such as potatoes, lettuce, and carrots), grasses, and plants known for the beauty of their flowers (roses, irises, and daffodils, for example). while individual plant species are unique, all share a common structure: a plant body consisting of stems, roots, and leaves. they all transport water, minerals, and  sugars produced through photosynthesis through the plant body in a similar manner. all plant species also respond to environmental factors, such as light, gravity, competition, temperature, and predation.","[('leaf', 'leavess', 'leaves'), ('plant form', 'plant forms'), ('megapascal',

155,stax-bio,30,Plant Form and Physiology,1,m44700,The Plant Body,"like animals, plants contain cells with organelles in which specific metabolic activities take place. unlike animals, however, plants use energy from sunlight to form sugars during photosynthesis. in addition, plant cells have cell walls, plastids, and a large central vacuole: structures that are not found in animal cells. each of these cellular structures plays a specific role in plant structure and function. in plants, just as in animals, similar cells working together form a tissue. when different types of tissues work together to perform a unique function, they form an organ; organs working together form organ systems. vascular plants have two distinct organ systems: a shoot system, and a root system. the shoot system consists of two portions: the vegetative (non-reproductive) parts of the plant, such as the leaves and the stems, and the reproductive parts of the plant, which include flowers and fruits. the shoot system generally grows above ground, where it absorbs the light needed for photosynthesis. the root system, which supports the plants and absorbs water and minerals, is usually underground. [link] shows the organ systems of a typical plant. plants are multicellular eukaryotes with tissue systems made of various cell types that carry out specific functions. plant tissue systems fall into one of two general types: meristematic tissue, and permanent (or non-meristematic) tissue. cells of the meristematic tissue are found in meristems, which are plant regions of continuous cell division and growth. meristematic tissue cells are either undifferentiated or incompletely differentiated, and they continue to divide and contribute to the growth of the plant. in contrast, permanent tissue consists of plant cells that are no longer actively dividing. meristematic tissues consist of three types, based on their location in the plant. apical meristems contain meristematic tissue located at the tips of stems and roots, which enable a plant to extend in length. lateral meristems facilitate growth in thickness or girth in a maturing plant. intercalary meristems occur only in monocots, at the bases of leaf blades and at nodes (the areas where leaves attach to a stem). this tissue enables the monocot leaf blade to increase in length from the leaf base; for example, it allows lawn grass leaves to elongate even after repeated mowing. meristems produce cells that quickly differentiate, or specialize, and become permanent tissue. such cells take on specific roles and lose their ability to divide further. they differentiate into three main types: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue. dermal tissue covers and protects the plant, and vascular tissue transports water, minerals, and sugars to different parts of the plant. ground tissue serves as a site for photosynthesis, provides a supporting matrix for the vascular tissue, and helps to store water and sugars. secondary tissues are either simple (composed of similar cell types) or complex (composed of different cell types). dermal tissue, for example, is a simple tissue that covers the outer surface of the plant and controls gas exchange. vascular tissue is an example of a complex tissue, and is made of two specialized conducting tissues: xylem and phloem. xylem tissue transports water and nutrients from the roots to different parts of the plant, and includes three different cell types: vessel elements and tracheids (both of which conduct water), and xylem parenchyma. phloem tissue, which transports organic compounds from the site of photosynthesis to other parts of the plant, consists of four different cell types: sieve cells (which conduct photosynthates), companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. unlike xylem conducting cells, phloem conducting cells are alive at maturity. the xylem and phloem always lie adjacent to each other ([link]). in stems, the xylem and the phloem form a structure called a vascular bundle; in roots, this is termed the vascular stele or vascular cylinder. a vascular plant consists of two organ systems: the shoot system and the root system. the shoot system includes the aboveground vegetative portions (stems and leaves) and reproductive parts (flowers and fruits). the root system supports the plant and is usually underground. a plant is composed of two main types of tissue: meristematic tissue and permanent tissue. meristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells found in root and shoot tips. as growth occurs, meristematic tissue differentiates into permanent tissue, which is categorized as either simple or complex. simple tissues are made up of similar cell types; examples include dermal tissue and ground tissue. dermal tissue provides the outer covering of the plant. ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis; it also supports vascular tissue and may store water and sugars. complex tissues are made up of different cell types. vascular tissue, for example, is made up of xylem and phloem cells.","[('ground tissue', 'ground tissues'), ('meristematic tissue', 'meristematic tissues'), ('complex plant tissue', 'complex plant tissues', 'complex plants tissue', 'complex plants tissues'), ('plant form', 'plant forms'), ('vascular tissue', 'vascular tissues'), ('simple plant tissue', 'simple plant tissues', 'simple plants tissue', 'simple plants tissues'), ('plant organ', 'plant organss', 'plant organs'), ('plant physiology', 'plant physiologies'), ('plant organ system', 'plant organ systems', 'plant organs system', 'plant organs systems'), ('lateral meristem', 'lateral meristems'), ('plant body', 'plant bodies'), ('permanent tissue', 'permanent tissues'), ('plant', 'plantss', 'plants'), ('vascular bundle', 'vascular bundles'), ('apical meristem', 'apical meristems'), ('root system', 'root systems'), ('dermal tissue', 'dermal tissues'), ('plant anatomy', 'plant anatomies'), ('shoot system', 'shoot systems'), ('intercalary meristem', 'intercalary meristems'), ('meristem', 'meristems')]"
156,stax-bio,30,Plant Form and Physiology,2,m44702,Stems,"stems are a part of the shoot system of a plant. they may range in length from a few millimeters to hundreds of meters, and also vary in diameter, depending on the plant type. stems are usually above ground, although the stems of some plants, such as the potato, also grow underground. stems may be herbaceous (soft) or woody in nature. their main function is to provide support to the plant, holding leaves, flowers and buds; in some cases, stems also store food for the plant. a stem may be unbranched, like that of a palm tree, or it may be highly branched, like that of a magnolia tree. the stem of the plant connects the roots to the leaves, helping to transport absorbed water and minerals to different parts of the plant. it also helps to transport the products of photosynthesis, namely sugars, from the leaves to the rest of the plant. plant stems, whether above or below ground, are characterized by the presence of nodes and internodes ([link]). nodes are points of attachment for leaves, aerial roots, and flowers. the stem region between two nodes is called an internode. the stalk that extends from the stem to the base of the leaf is the petiole. an axillary bud is usually found in the axilthe area between the base of a leaf and the stemwhere it can give rise to a branch or a flower. the apex (tip) of the shoot contains the apical meristem within the apical bud. the stem and other plant organs arise from the ground tissue, and are primarily made up of simple tissues formed from three types of cells: parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells. parenchyma cells are the most common plant cells ([link]). they are found in the stem, the root, the inside of the leaf, and the pulp of the fruit. parenchyma cells are responsible for metabolic functions, such as photosynthesis, and they help repair and heal wounds. some parenchyma cells also store starch. collenchyma cells are elongated cells with unevenly thickened walls ([link]). they provide structural support, mainly to the stem and leaves. these cells are alive at maturity and are usually found below the epidermis. the strings of a celery stalk are an example of collenchyma cells. sclerenchyma cells also provide support to the plant, but unlike collenchyma cells, many of them are dead at maturity. there are two types of sclerenchyma cells: fibers and sclereids. both types have secondary cell walls that are thickened with deposits of lignin, an organic compound that is a key component of wood. fibers are long, slender cells; sclereids are smaller-sized. sclereids give pears their gritty texture. humans use sclerenchyma fibers to make linen and rope ([link]). like the rest of the plant, the stem has three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue. each is distinguished by characteristic cell types that perform specific tasks necessary for the plants growth and survival. the dermal tissue of the stem consists primarily of epidermis, a single layer of cells covering and protecting the underlying tissue. woody plants have a tough, waterproof outer layer of cork cells commonly known as bark, which further protects the plant from damage. epidermal cells are the most numerous and least differentiated of the cells in the epidermis. the epidermis of a leaf also contains openings known as stomata, through which the exchange of gases takes place ([link]). two cells, known as guard cells, surround each leaf stoma, controlling its opening and closing and thus regulating the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water vapor. trichomes are hair-like structures on the epidermal surface. they help to reduce transpiration (the loss of water by aboveground plant parts), increase solar reflectance, and store compounds that defend the leaves against predation by herbivores. the xylem and phloem that make up the vascular tissue of the stem are arranged in distinct strands called vascular bundles, which run up and down the length of the stem. when the stem is viewed in cross section, the vascular bundles of dicot stems are arranged in a ring. in plants with stems that live for more than one year, the individual bundles grow together and produce the characteristic growth rings. in monocot stems, the vascular bundles are randomly scattered throughout the ground tissue ([link]). xylem tissue has three types of cells: xylem parenchyma, tracheids, and vessel elements. the latter two types conduct water and are dead at maturity. tracheids are xylem cells with thick secondary cell walls that are lignified. water moves from one tracheid to another through regions on the side walls known as pits, where secondary walls are absent. vessel elements are xylem cells with thinner walls; they are shorter than tracheids. each vessel element is connected to the next by means of a perforation plate at the end walls of the element. water moves through the perforation plates to travel up the plant. phloem tissue is composed of sieve-tube cells, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers. a series of sieve-tube cells (also called sieve-tube elements) are arranged end to end to make up a long sieve tube, which transports organic substances such as sugars and amino acids. the sugars flow from one sieve-tube cell to the next through perforated sieve plates, which are found at the end junctions between two cells. although still alive at maturity, the nucleus and other cell components of the sieve-tube cells have disintegrated. companion cells are found alongside the sieve-tube cells, providing them with metabolic support. the companion cells contain more ribosomes and mitochondria than the sieve-tube cells, which lack some cellular organelles. ground tissue is mostly made up of parenchyma cells, but may also contain collenchyma and sclerenchyma cells that help support the stem. the ground tissue towards the interior of the vascular tissue in a stem or root is known as pith, while the layer of tissue between the vascular tissue and the epidermis is known as the cortex. growth in plants occurs as the stems and roots lengthen. some plants, especially those that are woody, also increase in thickness during their life span. the increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth, and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem. secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant, and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem. [link] shows the areas of primary and secondary growth in a plant. herbaceous plants mostly undergo primary growth, with hardly any secondary growth or increase in thickness. secondary growth or wood is noticeable in woody plants; it occurs in some dicots, but occurs very rarely in monocots. some plant parts, such as stems and roots, continue to grow throughout a plants life: a phenomenon called indeterminate growth. other plant parts, such as leaves and flowers, exhibit determinate growth, which ceases when a plant part reaches a particular size. most primary growth occurs at the apices, or tips, of stems and roots. primary growth is a result of rapidly dividing cells in the apical meristems at the shoot tip and root tip. subsequent cell elongation also contributes to primary growth. the growth of shoots and roots during primary growth enables plants to continuously seek water (roots) or sunlight (shoots). the influence of the apical bud on overall plant growth is known as apical dominance, which diminishes the growth of axillary buds that form along the sides of branches and stems. most coniferous trees exhibit strong apical dominance, thus producing the typical conical christmas tree shape. if the apical bud is removed, then the axillary buds will start forming lateral branches. gardeners make use of this fact when they prune plants by cutting off the tops of branches, thus encouraging the axillary buds to grow out, giving the plant a bushy shape. the increase in stem thickness that results from secondary growth is due to the activity of the lateral meristems, which are lacking in herbaceous plants. lateral meristems include the vascular cambium and, in woody plants, the cork cambium (see [link]). the vascular cambium is located just outside the primary xylem and to the interior of the primary phloem. the cells of the vascular cambium divide and form secondary xylem (tracheids and vessel elements) to the inside, and secondary phloem (sieve elements and companion cells) to the outside. the thickening of the stem that occurs in secondary growth is due to the formation of secondary phloem and secondary xylem by the vascular cambium, plus the action of cork cambium, which forms the tough outermost layer of the stem. the cells of the secondary xylem contain lignin, which provides hardiness and strength. in woody plants, cork cambium is the outermost lateral meristem. it produces cork cells (bark) containing a waxy substance known as suberin that can repel water. the bark protects the plant against physical damage and helps reduce water loss. the cork cambium also produces a layer of cells known as phelloderm, which grows inward from the cambium. the cork cambium, cork cells, and phelloderm are collectively termed the periderm. the periderm substitutes for the epidermis in mature plants. in some plants, the periderm has many openings, known as lenticels, which allow the interior cells to exchange gases with the outside atmosphere ([link]). this supplies oxygen to the living and metabolically active cells of the cortex, xylem and phloem. the activity of the vascular cambium gives rise to annual growth rings. during the spring growing season, cells of the secondary xylem have a large internal diameter and their primary cell walls are not extensively thickened. this is known as early wood, or spring wood. during the fall season, the secondary xylem develops thickened cell walls, forming late wood, or autumn wood, which is denser than early wood. this alternation of early and late wood is due largely to a seasonal decrease in the number of vessel elements and a seasonal increase in the number of tracheids. it results in the formation of an annual ring, which can be seen as a circular ring in the cross section of the stem ([link]). an examination of the number of annual rings and their nature (such as their size and cell wall thickness) can reveal the age of the tree and the prevailing climatic conditions during each season. some plant species have modified stems that are especially suited to a particular habitat and environment ([link]). a rhizome is a modified stem that grows horizontally underground and has nodes and internodes. vertical shoots may arise from the buds on the rhizome of some plants, such as ginger and ferns. corms are similar to rhizomes, except they are more rounded and fleshy (such as in gladiolus). corms contain stored food that enables some plants to survive the winter. stolons are stems that run almost parallel to the ground, or just below the surface, and can give rise to new plants at the nodes. runners are a type of stolon that runs above the ground and produces new clone plants at nodes at varying intervals: strawberries are an example. tubers are modified stems that may store starch, as seen in the potato (solanum sp.). tubers arise as swollen ends of stolons, and contain many adventitious or unusual buds (familiar to us as the eyes on potatoes). a bulb, which functions as an underground storage unit, is a modification of a stem that has the appearance of enlarged fleshy leaves emerging from the stem or surrounding the base of the stem, as seen in the iris. some aerial modifications of stems are tendrils and thorns ([link]). tendrils are slender, twining strands that enable a plant (like a vine or pumpkin) to seek support by climbing on other surfaces. thorns are modified branches appearing as sharp outgrowths that protect the plant; common examples include roses, osage orange and devils walking stick. the stem of a plant bears the leaves, flowers, and fruits. stems are characterized by the presence of nodes (the points of attachment for leaves or branches) and internodes (regions between nodes). plant organs are made up of simple and complex tissues. the stem has three tissue systems: dermal, vascular, and ground tissue. dermal tissue is the outer covering of the plant. it contains epidermal cells, stomata, guard cells, and trichomes. vascular tissue is made up of xylem and phloem tissues and conducts water, minerals, and photosynthetic products. ground tissue is responsible for photosynthesis and support and is composed of parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells. primary growth occurs at the tips of roots and shoots, causing an increase in length. woody plants may also exhibit secondary growth, or increase in thickness. in woody plants, especially trees, annual rings may form as growth slows at the end of each season. some plant species have modified stems that help to store food, propagate new plants, or discourage predators. rhizomes, corms, stolons, runners, tubers, bulbs, tendrils, and thorns are examples of modified stems.","[('plant form', 'plant forms'), ('internode', 'internodes'),

157,stax-bio,30,Plant Form and Physiology,3,m44704,Roots,"the roots of seed plants have three major functions: anchoring the plant to the soil, absorbing water and minerals and transporting them upwards, and storing the products of photosynthesis. some roots are modified to absorb moisture and exchange gases. most roots are underground. some plants, however, also have adventitious roots, which emerge above the ground from the shoot. root systems are mainly of two types ([link]). dicots have a tap root system, while monocots have a fibrous root system. a tap root system has a main root that grows down vertically, and from which many smaller lateral roots arise. dandelions are a good example; their tap roots usually break off when trying to pull these weeds, and they can regrow another shoot from the remaining root). a tap root system penetrates deep into the soil. in contrast, a fibrous root system is located closer to the soil surface, and forms a dense network of roots that also helps prevent soil erosion (lawn grasses are a good example, as are wheat, rice, and corn). some plants have a combination of tap roots and fibrous roots. plants that grow in dry areas often have deep root systems, whereas plants growing in areas with abundant water are likely to have shallower root systems. root growth begins with seed germination. when the plant embryo emerges from the seed, the radicle of the embryo forms the root system. the tip of the root is protected by the root cap, a structure exclusive to roots and unlike any other plant structure. the root cap is continuously replaced because it gets damaged easily as the root pushes through soil. the root tip can be divided into three zones: a zone of cell division, a zone of elongation, and a zone of maturation and differentiation ([link]). the zone of cell division is closest to the root tip; it is made up of the actively dividing cells of the root meristem. the zone of elongation is where the newly formed cells increase in length, thereby lengthening the root. beginning at the first root hair is the zone of cell maturation where the root cells begin to differentiate into special cell types. all three zones are in the first centimeter or so of the root tip. the root has an outer layer of cells called the epidermis, which surrounds areas of ground tissue and vascular tissue. the epidermis provides protection and helps in absorption. root hairs, which are extensions of root epidermal cells, increase the surface area of the root, greatly contributing to the absorption of water and minerals. inside the root, the ground tissue forms two regions: the cortex and the pith ([link]). compared to stems, roots have lots of cortex and little pith. both regions include cells that store photosynthetic products. the cortex is between the epidermis and the vascular tissue, whereas the pith lies between the vascular tissue and the center of the root. the vascular tissue in the root is arranged in the inner portion of the root, which is called the stele ([link]). a layer of cells known as the endodermis separates the stele from the ground tissue in the outer portion of the root. the endodermis is exclusive to roots, and serves as a checkpoint for materials entering the roots vascular system. a waxy substance called suberin is present on the walls of the endodermal cells. this waxy region, known as the casparian strip, forces water and solutes to cross the plasma membranes of endodermal cells instead of slipping between the cells. this ensures that only materials required by the root pass through the endodermis, while toxic substances and pathogens are generally excluded. the outermost cell layer of the roots vascular tissue is the pericycle, an area that can give rise to lateral roots. in dicot roots, the xylem and phloem of the stele are arranged alternately in an x shape, whereas in monocot roots, the vascular tissue is arranged in a ring around the pith. root structures may be modified for specific purposes. for example, some roots are bulbous and store starch. aerial roots and prop roots are two forms of aboveground roots that provide additional support to anchor the plant. tap roots, such as carrots, turnips, and beets, are examples of roots that are modified for food storage ([link]). epiphytic roots enable a plant to grow on another plant. for example, the epiphytic roots of orchids develop a spongy tissue to absorb moisture. the banyan tree (ficus sp.) begins as an epiphyte, germinating in the branches of a host tree; aerial roots develop from the branches and eventually reach the ground, providing additional support ([link]). in screwpine (pandanus sp.), a palm-like tree that grows in sandy tropical soils, aboveground prop roots develop from the nodes to provide additional support. roots help to anchor a plant, absorb water and minerals, and serve as storage sites for food. taproots and fibrous roots are the two main types of root systems. in a taproot system, a main root grows vertically downward with a few lateral roots. fibrous root systems arise at the base of the stem, where a cluster of roots forms a dense network that is shallower than a taproot. the growing root tip is protected by a root cap. the root tip has three main zones: a zone of cell division (cells are actively dividing), a zone of elongation (cells increase in length), and a zone of maturation (cells differentiate to form different kinds of cells). root vascular tissue conducts water, minerals, and sugars. in some habitats, the roots of certain plants may be modified to form aerial roots or epiphytic roots.","[('tap root', 'tap roots'), ('modified root', 'modified roots'), ('plant form', 'plant forms'), ('root structure', 'root structures'), ('root', 'rootss', 'roots'), ('adventitious root', 'adventitious roots'), ('root zone', 'root zones'), ('stele', 'steles'), ('fibrous root', 'fibrous roots'), ('root anatomy', 'root anatomies'), ('root cap', 'root caps'), ('endodermi', 'endodermiss', 'endodermis'), ('root growth', 'root growths'), ('plant', 'plantss', 'plants'), ('casparian strip', 'casparian strips'), ('plant physiology', 'plant physiologies'), ('root modification', 'root modifications'), ('root hair', 'root hairs'), ('root system', 'root systems'), ('pericycle', 'pericycles'), ('root', 'roots')]"
158,stax-bio,30,Plant Form and Physiology,4,m44706,Leaves,"leaves are the main sites for photosynthesis: the process by which plants synthesize food. most leaves are usually green, due to the presence of chlorophyll in the leaf cells. however, some leaves may have different colors, caused by other plant pigments that mask the green chlorophyll. the thickness, shape, and size of leaves are adapted to the environment. each variation helps a plant species maximize its chances of survival in a particular habitat. usually, the leaves of plants growing in tropical rainforests have larger surface areas than those of plants growing in deserts or very cold conditions, which are likely to have a smaller surface area to minimize water loss. each leaf typically has a leaf blade called the lamina, which is also the widest part of the leaf. some leaves are attached to the plant stem by a petiole. leaves that do not have a petiole and are directly attached to the plant stem are called sessile leaves. small green appendages usually found at the base of the petiole are known as stipules. most leaves have a midrib, which travels the length of the leaf and branches to each side to produce veins of vascular tissue. the edge of the leaf is called the margin. [link] shows the structure of a typical eudicot leaf. within each leaf, the vascular tissue forms veins. the arrangement of veins in a leaf is called the venation pattern. monocots and dicots differ in their patterns of venation ([link]). monocots have parallel venation; the veins run in straight lines across the length of the leaf without converging at a point. in dicots, however, the veins of the leaf have a net-like appearance, forming a pattern known as reticulate venation. one extant plant, the ginkgo biloba, has dichotomous venation where the veins fork. the arrangement of leaves on a stem is known as phyllotaxy. the number and placement of a plants leaves will vary depending on the species, with each species exhibiting a characteristic leaf arrangement. leaves are classified as either alternate, spiral, or opposite. plants that have only one leaf per node have leaves that are said to be either alternatemeaning the leaves alternate on each side of the stem in a flat planeor spiral, meaning the leaves are arrayed in a spiral along the stem. in an opposite leaf arrangement, two leaves arise at the same point, with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch. if there are three or more leaves connected at a node, the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled. leaves may be simple or compound ([link]). in a simple leaf, the blade is either completely undividedas in the banana leafor it has lobes, but the separation does not reach the midrib, as in the maple leaf. in a compound leaf, the leaf blade is completely divided, forming leaflets, as in the locust tree. each leaflet may have its own stalk, but is attached to the rachis. a palmately compound leaf resembles the palm of a hand, with leaflets radiating outwards from one point examples include the leaves of poison ivy, the buckeye tree, or the familiar houseplant schefflera sp. (common name umbrella plant). pinnately compound leaves take their name from their feather-like appearance; the leaflets are arranged along the midrib, as in rose leaves (rosa sp.), or the leaves of hickory, pecan, ash, or walnut trees. the outermost layer of the leaf is the epidermis; it is present on both sides of the leaf and is called the upper and lower epidermis, respectively. botanists call the upper side the adaxial surface (or adaxis) and the lower side the abaxial surface (or abaxis). the epidermis helps in the regulation of gas exchange. it contains stomata ([link]): openings through which the exchange of gases takes place. two guard cells surround each stoma, regulating its opening and closing. the epidermis is usually one cell layer thick; however, in plants that grow in very hot or very cold conditions, the epidermis may be several layers thick to protect against excessive water loss from transpiration. a waxy layer known as the cuticle covers the leaves of all plant species. the cuticle reduces the rate of water loss from the leaf surface. other leaves may have small hairs (trichomes) on the leaf surface. trichomes help to deter herbivory by restricting insect movements, or by storing toxic or bad-tasting compounds; they can also reduce the rate of transpiration by blocking air flow across the leaf surface ([link]). below the epidermis of dicot leaves are layers of cells known as the mesophyll, or middle leaf. the mesophyll of most leaves typically contains two arrangements of parenchyma cells: the palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma ([link]). the palisade parenchyma (also called the palisade mesophyll) has column-shaped, tightly packed cells, and may be present in one, two, or three layers. below the palisade parenchyma are loosely arranged cells of an irregular shape. these are the cells of the spongy parenchyma (or spongy mesophyll). the air space found between the spongy parenchyma cells allows gaseous exchange between the leaf and the outside atmosphere through the stomata. in aquatic plants, the intercellular spaces in the spongy parenchyma help the leaf float. both layers of the mesophyll contain many chloroplasts. guard cells are the only epidermal cells to contain chloroplasts. like the stem, the leaf contains vascular bundles composed of xylem and phloem ([link]). the xylem consists of tracheids and vessels, which transport water and minerals to the leaves. the phloem transports the photosynthetic products from the leaf to the other parts of the plant. a single vascular bundle, no matter how large or small, always contains both xylem and phloem tissues. coniferous plant species that thrive in cold environments, like spruce, fir, and pine, have leaves that are reduced in size and needle-like in appearance. these needle-like leaves have sunken stomata and a smaller surface area: two attributes that aid in reducing water loss. in hot climates, plants such as cacti have leaves that are reduced to spines, which in combination with their succulent stems, help to conserve water. many aquatic plants have leaves with wide lamina that can float on the surface of the water, and a thick waxy cuticle on the leaf surface that repels water. plant adaptations in resource-deficient environmentsroots, stems, and leaves are structured to ensure that a plant can obtain the required sunlight, water, soil nutrients, and oxygen resources. some remarkable adaptations have evolved to enable plant species to thrive in less than ideal habitats, where one or more of these resources is in short supply. in tropical rainforests, light is often scarce, since many trees and plants grow close together and block much of the sunlight from reaching the forest floor. many tropical plant species have exceptionally broad leaves to maximize the capture of sunlight. other species are epiphytes: plants that grow on other plants that serve as a physical support. such plants are able to grow high up in the canopy atop the branches of other trees, where sunlight is more plentiful. epiphytes live on rain and minerals collected in the branches and leaves of the supporting plant. bromeliads (members of the pineapple family), ferns, and orchids are examples of tropical epiphytes ([link]). many epiphytes have specialized tissues that enable them to efficiently capture and store water. some plants have special adaptations that help them to survive in nutrient-poor environments. carnivorous plants, such as the venus flytrap and the pitcher plant ([link]), grow in bogs where the soil is low in nitrogen. in these plants, leaves are modified to capture insects. the insect-capturing leaves may have evolved to provide these plants with a supplementary source of much-needed nitrogen. many swamp plants have adaptations that enable them to thrive in wet areas, where their roots grow submerged underwater. in these aquatic areas, the soil is unstable and little oxygen is available to reach the roots. trees such as mangroves (rhizophora sp.) growing in coastal waters produce aboveground roots that help support the tree ([link]). some species of mangroves, as well as cypress trees, have pneumatophores: upward-growing roots containing pores and pockets of tissue specialized for gas exchange. wild rice is an aquatic plant with large air spaces in the root cortex. the air-filled tissuecalled aerenchymaprovides a path for oxygen to diffuse down to the root tips, which are embedded in oxygen-poor bottom sediments. watch venus flytraps: jaws of death, an extraordinary bbc close-up of the venus flytrap in action.

 leaves are the main site of photosynthesis. a typical leaf consists of a lamina (the broad part of the leaf, also called the blade) and a petiole (the stalk that attaches the leaf to a stem). the arrangement of leaves on a stem, known as phyllotaxy, enables maximum exposure to sunlight. each plant species has a characteristic leaf arrangement and form. the pattern of leaf arrangement may be alternate, opposite, or spiral, while leaf form may be simple or compound. leaf tissue consists of the epidermis, which forms the outermost cell layer, and mesophyll and vascular tissue, which make up the inner portion of the leaf. in some plant species, leaf form is modified to form structures such as tendrils, spines, bud scales, and needles.","[('leaf', 'leavess', 'leaves'), ('plant form', 'plant forms'), ('leaf form', 'leaf forms'), ('leaf structure', 'leaf structures'), ('lamina', 'laminas'), ('pinnately compound leaf', 'pinnately compound leaves', 'pinnately compounds leaf', 'pinnately compounds leaves'), ('venation', 'venations'), ('plant physiology', 'plant physiologies'), ('plant adaptation', 'plant adaptations'), ('stipule', 'stipules'), ('plant', 'plantss', 'plants'), ('phyllotaxy', 'phyllotaxies'), ('mesophyll', 'mesophylls'), ('cuticle', 'cuticles'), ('leaf', 'leaves'), ('leaf function', 'leaf functions'), ('compound leaf', 'compound leaves'), ('sessile', 'sessiles'), ('simple leaf', 'simple leaves'), ('leaf adaptation', 'leaf adaptations'), ('whorled', 'whorleds'), ('palmately compound leaf', 'palmately compound leaves', 'palmately compounds leaf', 'palmately compounds leaves'), ('leaf anatomy', 'leaf anatomies'), ('rachi', 'rachiss', 'rachis'), ('petiole', 'petioles'), ('leaf arrangement', 'leaf arrangements')]"
159,stax-bio,30,Plant Form and Physiology,5,m44708,Transport of Water and Solutes in Plants,"the structure of plant roots, stems, and leaves facilitates the transport of water, nutrients, and photosynthates throughout the plant. the phloem and xylem are the main tissues responsible for this movement. water potential, evapotranspiration, and stomatal regulation influence how water and nutrients are transported in plants. to understand how these processes work, we must first understand the energetics of water potential. plants are phenomenal hydraulic engineers. using only the basic laws of physics and the simple manipulation of potential energy, plants can move water to the top of a 116-meter-tall tree ([link]a). plants can also use hydraulics to generate enough force to split rocks and buckle sidewalks ([link]b). plants achieve this because of water potential. water potential is a measure of the potential energy in water. plant physiologists are not interested in the energy in any one particular aqueous system, but are very interested in water movement between two systems. in practical terms, therefore, water potential is the difference in potential energy between a given water sample and pure water (at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature). water potential is denoted by the greek letter  (psi) and is expressed in units of pressure (pressure is a form of energy) called megapascals (mpa). the potential of pure water (wpure h2o) is, by convenience of definition, designated a value of zero (even though pure water contains plenty of potential energy, that energy is ignored). water potential values for the water in a plant root, stem, or leaf are therefore expressed relative to wpure h2o. the water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and factors called matrix effects. water potential can be broken down into its individual components using the following equation: where s, p, g, and m refer to the solute, pressure, gravity, and matric potentials, respectively. system can refer to the water potential of the soil water (soil), root water (root), stem water (stem), leaf water (leaf) or the water in the atmosphere (atmosphere): whichever aqueous system is under consideration. as the individual components change, they raise or lower the total water potential of a system. when this happens, water moves to equilibrate, moving from the system or compartment with a higher water potential to the system or compartment with a lower water potential. this brings the difference in water potential between the two systems () back to zero ( = 0). therefore, for water to move through the plant from the soil to the air (a process called transpiration), soil must be > root > stem > leaf > atmosphere. water only moves in response to , not in response to the individual components. however, because the individual components influence the total system, by manipulating the individual components (especially s), a plant can control water movement. solute potential (s), also called osmotic potential, is negative in a plant cell and zero in distilled water. typical values for cell cytoplasm are 0.5 to 1.0 mpa. solutes reduce water potential (resulting in a negative w) by consuming some of the potential energy available in the water. solute molecules can dissolve in water because water molecules can bind to them via hydrogen bonds; a hydrophobic molecule like oil, which cannot bind to water, cannot go into solution. the energy in the hydrogen bonds between solute molecules and water is no longer available to do work in the system because it is tied up in the bond. in other words, the amount of available potential energy is reduced when solutes are added to an aqueous system. thus, s decreases with increasing solute concentration. because s is one of the four components of system or total, a decrease in s will cause a decrease in total. the internal water potential of a plant cell is more negative than pure water because of the cytoplasms high solute content ([link]). because of this difference in water potential water will move from the soil into a plants root cells via the process of osmosis. this is why solute potential is sometimes called osmotic potential. plant cells can metabolically manipulate s (and by extension, total) by adding or removing solute molecules. therefore, plants have control over total via their ability to exert metabolic control over s. pressure potential (p), also called turgor potential, may be positive or negative ([link]). because pressure is an expression of energy, the higher the pressure, the more potential energy in a system, and vice versa. therefore, a positive p (compression) increases total, and a negative p (tension) decreases total. positive pressure inside cells is contained by the cell wall, producing turgor pressure. pressure potentials are typically around 0.60.8 mpa, but can reach as high as 1.5 mpa in a well-watered plant. a p of 1.5 mpa equates to 210 pounds per square inch (1.5 mpa x 140 lb in-2 mpa-1 = 210 lb/in-2). as a comparison, most automobile tires are kept at a pressure of 3034 psi. an example of the effect of turgor pressure is the wilting of leaves and their restoration after the plant has been watered ([link]). water is lost from the leaves via transpiration (approaching p = 0 mpa at the wilting point) and restored by uptake via the roots. a plant can manipulate p via its ability to manipulate s and by the process of osmosis. if a plant cell increases the cytoplasmic solute concentration, s will decline, total will decline, the  between the cell and the surrounding tissue will decline, water will move into the cell by osmosis, and p will increase. p is also under indirect plant control via the opening and closing of stomata. stomatal openings allow water to evaporate from the leaf, reducing p and total of the leaf and increasing ii between the water in the leaf and the petiole, thereby allowing water to flow from the petiole into the leaf. gravity potential (g) is always negative to zero in a plant with no height. it always removes or consumes potential energy from the system. the force of gravity pulls water downwards to the soil, reducing the total amount of potential energy in the water in the plant (total). the taller the plant, the taller the water column, and the more influential g becomes. on a cellular scale and in short plants, this effect is negligible and easily ignored. however, over the height of a tall tree like a giant coastal redwood, the gravitational pull of 0.1 mpa m-1 is equivalent to an extra 1 mpa of resistance that must be overcome for water to reach the leaves of the tallest trees. plants are unable to manipulate g. matric potential (m) is always negative to zero. in a dry system, it can be as low as 2 mpa in a dry seed, and it is zero in a water-saturated system. the binding of water to a matrix always removes or consumes potential energy from the system. m is similar to solute potential because it involves tying up the energy in an aqueous system by forming hydrogen bonds between the water and some other component. however, in solute potential, the other components are soluble, hydrophilic solute molecules, whereas in m, the other components are insoluble, hydrophilic molecules of the plant cell wall. every plant cell has a cellulosic cell wall and the cellulose in the cell walls is hydrophilic, producing a matrix for adhesion of water: hence the name matric potential. m is very large (negative) in dry tissues such as seeds or drought-affected soils. however, it quickly goes to zero as the seed takes up water or the soil hydrates. m cannot be manipulated by the plant and is typically ignored in well-watered roots, stems, and leaves. solutes, pressure, gravity, and matric potential are all important for the transport of water in plants. water moves from an area of higher total water potential (higher gibbs free energy) to an area of lower total water potential. gibbs free energy is the energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work. this is expressed as . transpiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface. it is the main driver of water movement in the xylem. transpiration is caused by the evaporation of water at the leafatmosphere interface; it creates negative pressure (tension) equivalent to 2 mpa at the leaf surface. this value varies greatly depending on the vapor pressure deficit, which can be negligible at high relative humidity (rh) and substantial at low rh. water from the roots is pulled up by this tension. at night, when stomata shut and transpiration stops, the water is held in the stem and leaf by the adhesion of water to the cell walls of the xylem vessels and tracheids, and the cohesion of water molecules to each other. this is called the cohesiontension theory of sap ascent. inside the leaf at the cellular level, water on the surface of mesophyll cells saturates the cellulose microfibrils of the primary cell wall. the leaf contains many large intercellular air spaces for the exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide, which is required for photosynthesis. the wet cell wall is exposed to this leaf internal air space, and the water on the surface of the cells evaporates into the air spaces, decreasing the thin film on the surface of the mesophyll cells. this decrease creates a greater tension on the water in the mesophyll cells ([link]), thereby increasing the pull on the water in the xylem vessels. the xylem vessels and tracheids are structurally adapted to cope with large changes in pressure. rings in the vessels maintain their tubular shape, much like the rings on a vacuum cleaner hose keep the hose open while it is under pressure. small perforations between vessel elements reduce the number and size of gas bubbles that can form via a process called cavitation. the formation of gas bubbles in xylem interrupts the continuous stream of water from the base to the top of the plant, causing a break termed an embolism in the flow of xylem sap. the taller the tree, the greater the tension forces needed to pull water, and the more cavitation events. in larger trees, the resulting embolisms can plug xylem vessels, making them non-functional. transpirationthe loss of water vapor to the atmosphere through stomatais a passive process, meaning that metabolic energy in the form of atp is not required for water movement. the energy driving transpiration is the difference in energy between the water in the soil and the water in the atmosphere. however, transpiration is tightly controlled. the atmosphere to which the leaf is exposed drives transpiration, but also causes massive water loss from the plant. up to 90 percent of the water taken up by roots may be lost through transpiration. leaves are covered by a waxy cuticle on the outer surface that prevents the loss of water. regulation of transpiration, therefore, is achieved primarily through the opening and closing of stomata on the leaf surface. stomata are surrounded by two specialized cells called guard cells, which open and close in response to environmental cues such as light intensity and quality, leaf water status, and carbon dioxide concentrations. stomata must open to allow air containing carbon dioxide and oxygen to diffuse into the leaf for photosynthesis and respiration. when stomata are open, however, water vapor is lost to the external environment, increasing the rate of transpiration. therefore, plants must maintain a balance between efficient photosynthesis and water loss. plants have evolved over time to adapt to their local environment and reduce transpiration([link]). desert plant (xerophytes) and plants that grow on other plants (epiphytes) have limited access to water. such plants usually have a much thicker waxy cuticle than those growing in more moderate, well-watered environments (mesophytes). aquatic plants (hydrophytes) also have their own set of anatomical and morphological leaf adaptations. xerophytes and epiphytes often have a thick covering of trichomes or of stomata that are sunken below the leafs surface. trichomes are specialized hair-like epidermal cells that secrete oils and substances. these adaptations impede air flow across the stomatal pore and reduce transpiration. multiple epidermal layers are also commonly found in these types of plants. plants need an energy source to grow. in seeds and bulbs, food is stored in polymers (such as starch) that are converted by metabolic processes into sucrose for newly developing plants. once green shoots and leaves are growing, plants are able to produce their own food by photosynthesizing. the products of photosynthesis are called photosynthates, which are usually in the form of simple sugars such as sucrose. structures that produce photosynthates for the growing plant are referred to as sources. sugars produced in sources, such as leaves, need to be delivered to growing parts of the plant via the phloem in a process called translocation. the points of sugar delivery, such as roots, young shoots, and developing seeds, are called sinks. seeds, tubers, and bulbs can be either a source or a sink, depending on the plants stage of development and the season. the products from the source are usually translocated to the nearest sink through the phloem. for example, the highest leaves will send photosynthates upward to the growing shoot tip, whereas lower leaves will direct photosynthates downward to the roots. intermediate leaves will send products in both directions, unlike the flow in the xylem, which is always unidirectional (soil to leaf to atmosphere). the pattern of photosynthate flow changes as the plant grows and develops. photosynthates are directed primarily to the roots early on, to shoots and leaves during vegetative growth, and to seeds and fruits during reproductive development. they are also directed to tubers for storage. photosynthates, such as sucrose, are produced in the mesophyll cells of photosynthesizing leaves. from there they are translocated through the phloem to where they are used or stored. mesophyll cells are connected by cytoplasmic channels called plasmodesmata. photosynthates move through these channels to reach phloem sieve-tube elements (stes) in the vascular bundles. from the mesophyll cells, the photosynthates are loaded into the phloem stes. the sucrose is actively transported against its concentration gradient (a process requiring atp) into the phloem cells using the electrochemical potential of the proton gradient. this is coupled to the uptake of sucrose with a carrier protein called the sucrose-h+ symporter. phloem stes have reduced cytoplasmic contents, and are connected by a sieve plate with pores that allow for pressure-driven bulk flow, or translocation, of phloem sap. companion cells are associated with stes. they assist with metabolic activities and produce energy for the stes ([link]). once in the phloem, the photosynthates are translocated to the closest sink. phloem sap is an aqueous solution that contains up to 30 percent sugar, minerals, amino acids, and plant growth regulators. the high percentage of sugar decreases s, which decreases the total water potential and causes water to move by osmosis from the adjacent xylem into the phloem tubes, thereby increasing pressure. this increase in total water potential causes the bulk flow of phloem from source to sink ([link]). sucrose concentration in the sink cells is lower than in the phloem stes because the sink sucrose has been metabolized for growth, or converted to starch for storage or other polymers, such as cellulose, for structural integrity. unloading at the sink end of the phloem tube occurs by either diffusion or active transport of sucrose molecules from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration. water diffuses from the phloem by osmosis and is then transpired or recycled via the xylem back into the phloem sap. water potential () is a measure of the difference in potential energy between a water sample and pure water. the water potential in plant solutions is influenced by solute concentration, pressure, gravity, and matric potential. water potential and transpiration influence how water is transported through the xylem in plants. these processes are regulated by stomatal opening and closing. photosynthates (mainly sucrose) move from sources to sinks through the plants phloem. sucrose is actively loaded into the sieve-tube elements of the phloem. the increased solute concentration causes water to move by osmosis from the xylem into the phloem. the positive pressure that is produced pushes water and solutes down the pressure gradient. the sucrose is unloaded into the sink, and the water returns to the xylem vessels.","[('water potential', 'water potentials'), ('transpiration', 'transpirations'), ('plant form', 'plant forms'), ('water transport', 'water

160,stax-bio,30,Plant Form and Physiology,6,m44711,Plant Sensory Systems and Responses,"animals can respond to environmental factors by moving to a new location. plants, however, are rooted in place and must respond to the surrounding environmental factors. plants have sophisticated systems to detect and respond to light, gravity, temperature, and physical touch. receptors sense environmental factors and relay the information to effector systemsoften through intermediate chemical messengersto bring about plant responses. plants have a number of sophisticated uses for light that go far beyond their ability to photosynthesize low-molecular-weight sugars using only carbon dioxide, light, and water. photomorphogenesis is the growth and development of plants in response to light. it allows plants to optimize their use of light and space. photoperiodism is the ability to use light to track time. plants can tell the time of day and time of year by sensing and using various wavelengths of sunlight. phototropism is a directional response that allows plants to grow towards, or even away from, light. the sensing of light in the environment is important to plants; it can be crucial for competition and survival. the response of plants to light is mediated by different photoreceptors, which are comprised of a protein covalently bonded to a light-absorbing pigment called a chromophore. together, the two are called a chromoprotein. the red/far-red and violet-blue regions of the visible light spectrum trigger structural development in plants. sensory photoreceptors absorb light in these particular regions of the visible light spectrum because of the quality of light available in the daylight spectrum. in terrestrial habitats, light absorption by chlorophylls peaks in the blue and red regions of the spectrum. as light filters through the canopy and the blue and red wavelengths are absorbed, the spectrum shifts to the far-red end, shifting the plant community to those plants better adapted to respond to far-red light. blue-light receptors allow plants to gauge the direction and abundance of sunlight, which is rich in bluegreen emissions. water absorbs red light, which makes the detection of blue light essential for algae and aquatic plants. the phytochromes are a family of chromoproteins with a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore, similar to the ringed tetrapyrrole light-absorbing head group of chlorophyll. phytochromes have two photo-interconvertible forms: pr and pfr. pr absorbs red light (~667nm) and is immediately converted to pfr. pfr absorbs far-red light (~730nm) and is quickly converted back to pr. absorption of red or far-red light causes a massive change to the shape of the chromophore, altering the conformation and activity of the phytochrome protein to which it is bound. pfr is the physiologically active form of the protein; therefore, exposure to red light yields physiological activity. exposure to far-red light inhibits phytochrome activity. together, the two forms represent the phytochrome system ([link]). the phytochrome system acts as a biological light switch. it monitors the level, intensity, duration, and color of environmental light. the effect of red light is reversible by immediately shining far-red light on the sample, which converts the chromoprotein to the inactive pr form. additionally, pfr can slowly revert to pr in the dark, or break down over time. in all instances, the physiological response induced by red light is reversed. the active form of phytochrome (pfr) can directly activate other molecules in the cytoplasm, or it can be trafficked to the nucleus, where it directly activates or represses specific gene expression. once the phytochrome system evolved, plants adapted it to serve a variety of needs. unfiltered, full sunlight contains much more red light than far-red light. because chlorophyll absorbs strongly in the red region of the visible spectrum, but not in the far-red region, any plant in the shade of another plant on the forest floor will be exposed to red-depleted, far-red-enriched light. the preponderance of far-red light converts phytochrome in the shaded leaves to the pr (inactive) form, slowing growth. the nearest non-shaded (or even less-shaded) areas on the forest floor have more red light; leaves exposed to these areas sense the red light, which activates the pfr form and induces growth. in short, plant shoots use the phytochrome system to grow away from shade and towards light. because competition for light is so fierce in a dense plant community, the evolutionary advantages of the phytochrome system are obvious. in seeds, the phytochrome system is not used to determine direction and quality of light (shaded versus unshaded). instead, is it used merely to determine if there is any light at all. this is especially important in species with very small seeds, such as lettuce. because of their size, lettuce seeds have few food reserves. their seedlings cannot grow for long before they run out of fuel. if they germinated even a centimeter under the soil surface, the seedling would never make it into the sunlight and would die. in the dark, phytochrome is in the pr (inactive form) and the seed will not germinate; it will only germinate if exposed to light at the surface of the soil. upon exposure to light, pr is converted to pfr and germination proceeds. plants also use the phytochrome system to sense the change of season. photoperiodism is a biological response to the timing and duration of day and night. it controls flowering, setting of winter buds, and vegetative growth. detection of seasonal changes is crucial to plant survival. although temperature and light intensity influence plant growth, they are not reliable indicators of season because they may vary from one year to the next. day length is a better indicator of the time of year. as stated above, unfiltered sunlight is rich in red light but deficient in far-red light. therefore, at dawn, all the phytochrome molecules in a leaf quickly convert to the active pfr form, and remain in that form until sunset. in the dark, the pfr form takes hours to slowly revert back to the pr form. if the night is long (as in winter), all of the pfr form reverts. if the night is short (as in summer), a considerable amount of pfr may remain at sunrise. by sensing the pr/pfr ratio at dawn, a plant can determine the length of the day/night cycle. in addition, leaves retain that information for several days, allowing a comparison between the length of the previous night and the preceding several nights. shorter nights indicate springtime to the plant; when the nights become longer, autumn is approaching. this information, along with sensing temperature and water availability, allows plants to determine the time of the year and adjust their physiology accordingly. short-day (long-night) plants use this information to flower in the late summer and early fall, when nights exceed a critical length (often eight or fewer hours). long-day (short-night) plants flower during the spring, when darkness is less than a critical length (often eight to 15 hours). not all plants use the phytochrome system in this way. flowering in day-neutral plants is not regulated by daylength. horticulturalistthe word horticulturist comes from the latin words for garden (hortus) and culture (cultura). this career has been revolutionized by progress made in the understanding of plant responses to environmental stimuli. growers of crops, fruit, vegetables, and flowers were previously constrained by having to time their sowing and harvesting according to the season. now, horticulturists can manipulate plants to increase leaf, flower, or fruit production by understanding how environmental factors affect plant growth and development. greenhouse management is an essential component of a horticulturists education. to lengthen the night, plants are covered with a blackout shade cloth. long-day plants are irradiated with red light in winter to promote early flowering. for example, fluorescent (cool white) light high in blue wavelengths encourages leafy growth and is excellent for starting seedlings. incandescent lamps (standard light bulbs) are rich in red light, and promote flowering in some plants. the timing of fruit ripening can be increased or delayed by applying plant hormones. recently, considerable progress has been made in the development of plant breeds that are suited to different climates and resistant to pests and transportation damage. both crop yield and quality have increased as a result of practical applications of the knowledge of plant responses to external stimuli and hormones. horticulturists find employment in private and governmental laboratories, greenhouses, botanical gardens, and in the production or research fields. they improve crops by applying their knowledge of genetics and plant physiology. to prepare for a horticulture career, students take classes in botany, plant physiology, plant pathology, landscape design, and plant breeding. to complement these traditional courses, horticulture majors add studies in economics, business, computer science, and communications. phototropismthe directional bending of a plant toward or away from a light sourceis a response to blue wavelengths of light. positive phototropism is growth towards a light source ([link]), while negative phototropism (also called skototropism) is growth away from light. the aptly-named phototropins are protein-based receptors responsible for mediating the phototropic response. like all plant photoreceptors, phototropins consist of a protein portion and a light-absorbing portion, called the chromophore. in phototropins, the chromophore is a covalently-bound molecule of flavin; hence, phototropins belong to a class of proteins called flavoproteins. other responses under the control of phototropins are leaf opening and closing, chloroplast movement, and the opening of stomata. however, of all responses controlled by phototropins, phototropism has been studied the longest and is the best understood. in their 1880 treatise the power of movements in plants, charles darwin and his son francis first described phototropism as the bending of seedlings toward light. darwin observed that light was perceived by the tip of the plant (the apical meristem), but that the response (bending) took place in a different part of the plant. they concluded that the signal had to travel from the apical meristem to the base of the plant. in 1913, peter boysen-jensen demonstrated that a chemical signal produced in the plant tip was responsible for the bending at the base. he cut off the tip of a seedling, covered the cut section with a layer of gelatin, and then replaced the tip. the seedling bent toward the light when illuminated. however, when impermeable mica flakes were inserted between the tip and the cut base, the seedling did not bend. a refinement of the experiment showed that the signal traveled on the shaded side of the seedling. when the mica plate was inserted on the illuminated side, the plant did bend towards the light. therefore, the chemical signal was a growth stimulant because the phototropic response involved faster cell elongation on the shaded side than on the illuminated side. we now know that as light passes through a plant stem, it is diffracted and generates phototropin activation across the stem. most activation occurs on the lit side, causing the plant hormone indole acetic acid (iaa) to accumulate on the shaded side. stem cells elongate under influence of iaa. cryptochromes are another class of blue-light absorbing photoreceptors that also contain a flavin-based chromophore.  cryptochromes set the plants 24-hour activity cycle, also know as its circadian rhythem, using blue light cues. there is some evidence that cryptochromes work together with phototropins to mediate the phototropic response. whether or not they germinate in the light or in total darkness, shoots usually sprout up from the ground, and roots grow downward into the ground. a plant laid on its side in the dark will send shoots upward when given enough time. gravitropism ensures that roots grow into the soil and that shoots grow toward sunlight. growth of the shoot apical tip upward is called negative gravitropism, whereas growth of the roots downward is called positive gravitropism. amyloplasts (also known as statoliths) are specialized plastids that contain starch granules and settle downward in response to gravity. amyloplasts are found in shoots and in specialized cells of the root cap. when a plant is tilted, the statoliths drop to the new bottom cell wall. a few hours later, the shoot or root will show growth in the new vertical direction. the mechanism that mediates gravitropism is reasonably well understood. when amyloplasts settle to the bottom of the gravity-sensing cells in the root or shoot, they physically contact the endoplasmic reticulum (er), causing the release of calcium ions from inside the er. this calcium signaling in the cells causes polar transport of the plant hormone iaa to the bottom of the cell. in roots, a high concentration of iaa inhibits cell elongation. the effect slows growth on the lower side of the root, while cells develop normally on the upper side. iaa has the opposite effect in shoots, where a higher concentration at the lower side of the shoot stimulates cell expansion, causing the shoot to grow up. after the shoot or root begin to grow vertically, the amyloplasts return to their normal position. other hypothesesinvolving the entire cell in the gravitropism effecthave been proposed to explain why some mutants that lack amyloplasts may still exhibit a weak gravitropic response. a plants sensory response to external stimuli relies on chemical messengers (hormones). plant hormones affect all aspects of plant life, from flowering to fruit setting and maturation, and from phototropism to leaf fall. potentially every cell in a plant can produce plant hormones. they can act in their cell of origin or be transported to other portions of the plant body, with many plant responses involving the synergistic or antagonistic interaction of two or more hormones. in contrast, animal hormones are produced in specific glands and transported to a distant site for action, and they act alone. plant hormones are a group of unrelated chemical substances that affect plant morphogenesis. five major plant hormones are traditionally described: auxins (particularly iaa), cytokinins, gibberellins, ethylene, and abscisic acid. in addition, other nutrients and environmental conditions can be characterized as growth factors. the term auxin is derived from the greek word auxein, which means ""to grow."" auxins are the main hormones responsible for cell elongation in phototropism and gravitropism. they also control the differentiation of meristem into vascular tissue, and promote leaf development and arrangement. while many synthetic auxins are used as herbicides, iaa is the only naturally occurring auxin that shows physiological activity. apical dominancethe inhibition of lateral bud formationis triggered by auxins produced in the apical meristem. flowering, fruit setting and ripening, and inhibition of abscission (leaf falling) are other plant responses under the direct or indirect control of auxins. auxins also act as a relay for the effects of the blue light and red/far-red responses. commercial use of auxins is widespread in plant nurseries and for crop production. iaa is used as a rooting hormone to promote growth of adventitious roots on cuttings and detached leaves. applying synthetic auxins to tomato plants in greenhouses promotes normal fruit development. outdoor application of auxin promotes synchronization of fruit setting and dropping to coordinate the harvesting season. fruits such as seedless cucumbers can be induced to set fruit by treating unfertilized plant flowers with auxins. the effect of cytokinins was first reported when it was found that adding the liquid endosperm of coconuts to developing plant embryos in culture stimulated their growth. the stimulating growth factor was found to be cytokinin, a hormone that promotes cytokinesis (cell division). almost 200 naturally occurring or synthetic cytokinins are known to date. cytokinins are most abundant in growing tissues, such as roots, embryos, and fruits, where cell division is occurring. cytokinins are known to delay senescence in leaf tissues, promote mitosis, and stimulate differentiation of the meristem in shoots and roots. many effects on plant development are under the influence of cytokinins, either in conjunction with auxin or another hormone. for example, apical dominance seems to result from a balance between auxins that inhibit lateral buds, and cytokinins that promote bushier growth. gibberellins (gas) are a group of about 125 closely related plant hormones that stimulate shoot elongation, seed germination, and fruit and flower maturation. gas are synthesized in the root and stem apical meristems, young leaves, and seed embryos. in urban areas, ga antagonists are sometimes applied to trees under power lines to control growth and reduce the frequency of pruning. gas break dormancy (a state of inhibited growth and development) in the seeds of plants that require exposure to cold or light to germinate. abscisic acid is a strong antagonist of ga action. other effects of gas include gender expression, seedless fruit development, and the delay of senescence in leaves and fruit. seedless grapes are obtained through standard breeding methods and contain inconspicuous seeds that fail to develop. because gas are produced by the seeds, and because fruit development and stem elongation are under ga control, these varieties of grapes would normally produce small fruit in compact clusters. maturing grapes are routinely treated with ga to promote larger fruit size, as well as looser bunches (longer stems), which reduces the instance of mildew infection ([link]). the plant hormone abscisic acid (aba) was first discovered as the agent that causes the abscission or dropping of cotton bolls. however, more recent studies indicate that aba plays only a minor role in the abscission process. aba accumulates as a response to stressful environmental conditions, such as dehydration, cold temperatures, or shortened day lengths. its activity counters many of the growth-promoting effects of gas and auxins. aba inhibits stem elongation and induces dormancy in lateral buds. aba induces dormancy in seeds by blocking germination and promoting the synthesis of storage proteins. plants adapted to temperate climates require a long period of cold temperature before seeds germinate. this mechanism protects young plants from sprouting too early during unseasonably warm weather in winter. as the hormone gradually breaks down over winter, the seed is released from dormancy and germinates when conditions are favorable in spring. another effect of aba is to promote the development of winter buds; it mediates the conversion of the apical meristem into a dormant bud. low soil moisture causes an increase in aba, which causes stomata to close, reducing water loss in winter buds. ethylene is associated with fruit ripening, flower wilting, and leaf fall. ethylene is unusual because it is a volatile gas (c2h4). hundreds of years ago, when gas street lamps were installed in city streets, trees that grew close to lamp posts developed twisted, thickened trunks and shed their leaves earlier than expected. these effects were caused by ethylene volatilizing from the lamps. aging tissues (especially senescing leaves) and nodes of stems produce ethylene. the best-known effect of the hormone, however, is the promotion of fruit ripening. ethylene stimulates the conversion of starch and acids to sugars. some people store unripe fruit, such as avocadoes, in a sealed paper bag to accelerate ripening; the gas released by the first fruit to mature will speed up the maturation of the remaining fruit. ethylene also triggers leaf and fruit abscission, flower fading and dropping, and promotes germination in some cereals and sprouting of bulbs and potatoes. ethylene is widely used in agriculture. commercial fruit growers control the timing of fruit ripening with application of the gas. horticulturalists inhibit leaf dropping in ornamental plants by removing ethylene from greenhouses using fans and ventilation. recent research has discovered a number of compounds that also influence plant development. their roles are less understood than the effects of the major hormones described so far. jasmonates play a major role in defense responses to herbivory. their levels increase when a plant is wounded by a predator, resulting in an increase in toxic secondary metabolites. they contribute to the production of volatile compounds that attract natural enemies of predators. for example, chewing of tomato plants by caterpillars leads to an increase in jasmonic acid levels, which in turn triggers the release of volatile compounds that attract predators of the pest. oligosaccharins also play a role in plant defense against bacterial and fungal infections. they act locally at the site of injury, and can also be transported to other tissues. strigolactones promote seed germination in some species and inhibit lateral apical development in the absence of auxins. strigolactones also play a role in the establishment of mycorrhizae, a mutualistic association of plant roots and fungi. brassinosteroids are important to many developmental and physiological processes. signals between these compounds and other hormones, notably auxin and gas, amplifies their physiological effect. apical dominance, seed germination, gravitropism, and resistance to freezing are all positively influenced by hormones. root growth and fruit dropping are inhibited by steroids. the shoot of a pea plant winds around a trellis, while a tree grows on an angle in response to strong prevailing winds. these are examples of how plants respond to touch or wind. the movement of a plant subjected to constant directional pressure is called thigmotropism, from the greek words thigma meaning touch, and tropism implying direction. tendrils are one example of this. the meristematic region of tendrils is very touch sensitive; light touch will evoke a quick coiling response. cells in contact with a support surface contract, whereas cells on the opposite side of the support expand ([link]). application of jasmonic acid is sufficient to trigger tendril coiling without a mechanical stimulus. a thigmonastic response is a touch response independent of the direction of stimulus [link]. in the venus flytrap, two modified leaves are joined at a hinge and lined with thin fork-like tines along the outer edges. tiny hairs are located inside the trap. when an insect brushes against these trigger hairs, touching two or more of them in succession, the leaves close quickly, trapping the prey. glands on the leaf surface secrete enzymes that slowly digest the insect. the released nutrients are absorbed by the leaves, which reopen for the next meal. thigmomorphogenesis is a slow developmental change in the shape of a plant subjected to continuous mechanical stress. when trees bend in the wind, for example, growth is usually stunted and the trunk thickens. strengthening tissue, especially xylem, is produced to add stiffness to resist the winds force. researchers hypothesize that mechanical strain induces growth and differentiation to strengthen the tissues. ethylene and jasmonate are likely involved in thigmomorphogenesis. plants face two types of enemies: herbivores and pathogens. herbivores both large and small use plants as food, and actively chew them. pathogens are agents of disease. these infectious microorganisms, such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes, live off of the plant and damage its tissues. plants have developed a variety of strategies to discourage or kill attackers. the first line of defense in plants is an intact and impenetrable barrier. bark and the waxy cuticle can protect against predators. other adaptations against herbivory include thorns, which are modified branches, and spines, which are modified leaves. they discourage animals by causing physical damage and inducing rashes and allergic reactions. a plants exterior protection can be compromised by mechanical damage, which may provide an entry point for pathogens. if the first line of defense is breached, the plant must resort to a different set of defense mechanisms, such as toxins and enzymes. secondary metabolites are compounds that are not directly derived from photosynthesis and are not necessary for respiration or plant growth and development. many metabolites are toxic, and can even be lethal to animals that ingest them. some metabolites are alkaloids, which discourage predators with noxious odors (such as the volatile oils of mint and sage) or repellent tastes (like the bitterness of quinine). other alkaloids affect herbivores by causing either excessive stimulation (caffeine is one example) or the lethargy associated with opioids. some compounds become toxic after ingestion; for instance, glycol cyanide in the cassava root releases cyanide only upon ingestion by the herbivore. mechanical wounding and predator attacks activate defense and protection mechanisms both in the damaged tissue and at sites farther from the injury location. some defense reactions occur within minutes: others over several hours. the infected and surrounding cells may die, thereby stopping the spread of infection. long-distance signaling elicits a systemic response aimed at deterring the predator. as tissue is damaged, jasmonates may promote the synthesis of compounds that are toxic to predators. jasmonates also elicit the synthesis of volatile compounds that attract parasitoids, which are insects that spend their developing stages in or on another insect, and eventually kill their host. the plant may activate abscission of injured tissue if it is damaged beyond repair. plants respond to light by changes in morphology and activity. irradiation by red light converts the photoreceptor phytochrome to its far-red light-absorbing formpfr. this form controls germination and flowering in response to length of day, as well as triggers photosynthesis in dormant plants or those that just emerged from the soil. blue-light receptors, cryptochromes, and phototropins are responsible for phototropism. amyloplasts, which contain heavy starch granules, sense gravity. shoots exhibit negative gravitropism, whereas roots exhibit positive gravitropism. plant hormonesnaturally occurring compounds synthesized in small amountscan act both in the cells that produce them and in distant tissues and organs. auxins are responsible for apical dominance, root growth, directional growth toward light, and many other growth responses. cytokinins stimulate cell division and counter apical dominance in shoots. gibberellins inhibit dormancy of seeds and promote stem growth. abscisic acid induces dormancy in seeds and buds, and protects plants from excessive water loss by promoting stomatal closure. ethylene gas speeds up fruit ripening and dropping of leaves. plants respond to touch by rapid movements (thigmotropy and thigmonasty) and slow differential growth (thigmomorphogenesis). plants have evolved defense mechanisms against predators and pathogens. physical barriers like bark and spines protect tender tissues. plants also have chemical defenses, including toxic secondary metabolites and hormones, which elicit additional defense mechanisms.","[('oligosaccharin', 'oligosaccharins'), ('gravitropism', 'gravitropisms'), ('abscisic acid', 'abscisic acids'), ('blue light', 'blue lights'), ('strigolactone',

162,stax-bio,31,Soil and Plant Nutrition,1,m44714,Nutritional Requirements of Plants,"plants are unique organisms that can absorb nutrients and water through their root system, as well as carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. soil quality and climate are the major determinants of plant distribution and growth. the combination of soil nutrients, water, and carbon dioxide, along with sunlight, allows plants to grow. since plants require nutrients in the form of elements such as carbon and potassium, it is important to understand the chemical composition of plants. the majority of volume in a plant cell is water; it typically comprises 80 to 90 percent of the plants total weight. soil is the water source for land plants, and can be an abundant source of water, even if it appears dry. plant roots absorb water from the soil through root hairs and transport it up to the leaves through the xylem. as water vapor is lost from the leaves, the process of transpiration and the polarity of water molecules (which enables them to form hydrogen bonds) draws more water from the roots up through the plant to the leaves ([link]). plants need water to support cell structure, for metabolic functions, to carry nutrients, and for photosynthesis. plant cells need essential substances, collectively called nutrients, to sustain life.  plant nutrients may be composed of either organic or inorganic compounds. an organic compound is a chemical compound that contains carbon, such as carbon dioxide obtained from the atmosphere. carbon that was obtained from atmospheric co2 composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants. an inorganic compound does not contain carbon and is not part of, or produced by, a living organism. inorganic substances, which form the majority of the soil solution, are commonly called minerals: those required by plants include nitrogen (n) and potassium (k) for structure and regulation. plants require only light, water and about 20 elements to support all their biochemical needs: these 20 elements are called essential nutrients ([link]). for an element to be regarded as essential, three criteria are required: 1) a plant cannot complete its life cycle without the element; 2) no other element can perform the function of the element; and 3) the element is directly involved in plant nutrition. the essential elements can be divided into two groups: macronutrients and micronutrients. nutrients that plants require in larger amounts are called macronutrients. about half of the essential elements are considered macronutrients: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulfur. the first of these macronutrients, carbon (c), is required to form carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and many other compounds; it is therefore present in all macromolecules. on average, the dry weight (excluding water) of a cell is 50 percent carbon. as shown in [link], carbon is a key part of plant biomolecules. the next most abundant element in plant cells is nitrogen (n); it is part of proteins and nucleic acids. nitrogen is also used in the synthesis of some vitamins. hydrogen and oxygen are macronutrients that are part of many organic compounds, and also form water. oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration; plants use oxygen to store energy in the form of atp. phosphorus (p), another macromolecule, is necessary to synthesize nucleic acids and phospholipids. as part of atp, phosphorus enables food energy to be converted into chemical energy through oxidative phosphorylation. likewise, light energy is converted into chemical energy during photophosphorylation in photosynthesis, and into chemical energy to be extracted during respiration.sulfur is part of certain amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine, and is present in several coenzymes. sulfur also plays a role in photosynthesis as part of the electron transport chain, where hydrogen gradients play a key role in the conversion of light energy into atp. potassium (k) is important because of its role in regulating stomatal opening and closing. as the openings for gas exchange, stomata help maintain a healthy water balance; a potassium ion pump supports this process. magnesium (mg) and calcium (ca) are also important macronutrients. the role of calcium is twofold: to regulate nutrient transport, and to support many enzyme functions. magnesium is important to the photosynthetic process. these minerals, along with the micronutrients, which are described below, also contribute to the plants ionic balance. in addition to macronutrients, organisms require various elements in small amounts. these micronutrients, or trace elements, are present in very small quantities. they include boron (b), chlorine (cl), manganese (mn), iron (fe), zinc (zn), copper (cu), molybdenum (mo), nickel (ni), silicon (si), and sodium (na). deficiencies in any of these nutrientsparticularly the macronutrientscan adversely affect plant growth ([link]. depending on the specific nutrient, a lack can cause stunted growth, slow growth, or chlorosis (yellowing of the leaves). extreme deficiencies may result in leaves showing signs of cell death. hydroponics is a method of growing plants in a water-nutrient solution instead of soil. since its advent, hydroponics has developed into a growing process that researchers often use. scientists who are interested in studying plant nutrient deficiencies can use hydroponics to study the effects of different nutrient combinations under strictly controlled conditions. hydroponics has also developed as a way to grow flowers, vegetables, and other crops in greenhouse environments. you might find hydroponically grown produce at your local grocery store. today, many lettuces and tomatoes in your market have been hydroponically grown. plants can absorb inorganic nutrients and water through their root system, and carbon dioxide from the environment. the combination of organic compounds, along with water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight, produce the energy that allows plants to grow. inorganic compounds form the majority of the soil solution. plants access water though the soil. water is absorbed by the plant root, transports nutrients throughout the plant, and maintains the structure of the plant. essential elements are indispensable elements for plant growth. they are divided into macronutrients and micronutrients. the macronutrients plants require are carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. important micronutrients include iron, manganese, boron, molybdenum, copper, zinc, chlorine, nickel, cobalt, silicon and sodium.","[('plant nutrient', 'plant nutrients'), ('nutritional requirement of plant', 'nutritional requirement of plantss', 'nutritional requirement of plants', 'nutritional requirements of plant', 'nutritional requirements of plantss', 'nutritional requirements of plants'), ('macronutrient', 'macronutrients'), ('plant nutrition', 'plant nutritions'), ('organic compound', 'organic compounds'), ('hydroponic', 'hydroponicss', 'hydroponics'), ('plant chemical composition', 'plant chemical compositions', 'plant chemicals composition', 'plant chemicals compositions', 'plants chemical composition', 'plants chemical compositions', 'plants chemicals composition', 'plants chemicals compositions'), ('micronutrient', 'micronutrients'), ('soil', 'soils'), ('nutrient deficiency', 'nutrient deficiencies'), ('essential element', 'essential elements'), ('inorganic compound', 'inorganic compounds')]"
163,stax-bio,31,Soil and Plant Nutrition,2,m44715,The Soil,"plants obtain inorganic elements from the soil, which serves as a natural medium for land plants. soil is the outer loose layer that covers the surface of earth. soil quality is a major determinant, along with climate, of plant distribution and growth. soil quality depends not only on the chemical composition of the soil, but also the topography (regional surface features) and the presence of living organisms. in agriculture, the history of the soil, such as the cultivating practices and previous crops, modify the characteristics and fertility of that soil. soil develops very slowly over long periods of time, and its formation results from natural and environmental forces acting on mineral, rock, and organic compounds. soils can be divided into two groups: organic soils are those that are formed from sedimentation and primarily composed of organic matter, while those that are formed from the weathering of rocks and are primarily composed of inorganic material are called mineral soils. mineral soils are predominant in terrestrial ecosystems, where soils may be covered by water for part of the year or exposed to the atmosphere. soil consists of these major components ([link]): the amount of each of the four major components of soil depends on the amount of vegetation, soil compaction, and water present in the soil. a good healthy soil has sufficient air, water, minerals, and organic material to promote and sustain plant life. the organic material of soil, called humus, is made up of microorganisms (dead and alive), and dead animals and plants in varying stages of decay. humus improves soil structure and provides plants with water and minerals. the inorganic material of soil consists of rock, slowly broken down into smaller particles that vary in size. soil particles that are 0.1 to 2 mm in diameter are sand. soil particles between 0.002 and 0.1mm are called silt, and even smaller particles, less than 0.002 mm in diameter, are called clay. some soils have no dominant particle size and contain a mixture of sand, silt, and humus; these soils are called loams. soil formation is the consequence of a combination of biological, physical, and chemical processes. soil should ideally contain 50 percent solid material and 50 percent pore space. about one-half of the pore space should contain water, and the other half should contain air. the organic component of soil serves as a cementing agent, returns nutrients to the plant, allows soil to store moisture, makes soil tillable for farming, and provides energy for soil microorganisms. most soil microorganismsbacteria, algae, or fungiare dormant in dry soil, but become active once moisture is available. soil distribution is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers; together, the vertical section of a soil is called the soil profile. within the soil profile, soil scientists define zones called horizons. a horizon is a soil layer with distinct physical and chemical properties that differ from those of other layers. five factors account for soil formation: parent material, climate, topography, biological factors, and time. the organic and inorganic material in which soils form is the parent material. mineral soils form directly from the weathering of bedrock, the solid rock that lies beneath the soil, and therefore, they have a similar composition to the original rock. other soils form in materials that came from elsewhere, such as sand and glacial drift. materials located in the depth of the soil are relatively unchanged compared with the deposited material. sediments in rivers may have different characteristics, depending on whether the stream moves quickly or slowly. a fast-moving river could have sediments of rocks and sand, whereas a slow-moving river could have fine-textured material, such as clay. temperature, moisture, and wind cause different patterns of weathering and therefore affect soil characteristics. the presence of moisture and nutrients from weathering will also promote biological activity: a key component of a quality soil. regional surface features (familiarly called the lay of the land) can have a major influence on the characteristics and fertility of a soil. topography affects water runoff, which strips away parent material and affects plant growth. steeps soils are more prone to erosion and may be thinner than soils that are relatively flat or level. the presence of living organisms greatly affects soil formation and structure. animals and microorganisms can produce pores and crevices, and plant roots can penetrate into crevices to produce more fragmentation. plant secretions promote the development of microorganisms around the root, in an area known as the rhizosphere. additionally, leaves and other material that fall from plants decompose and contribute to soil composition. time is an important factor in soil formation because soils develop over long periods. soil formation is a dynamic process. materials are deposited over time, decompose, and transform into other materials that can be used by living organisms or deposited onto the surface of the soil. soils are named and classified based on their horizons. the soil profile has four distinct layers: 1) o horizon; 2) a horizon; 3) b horizon, or subsoil; and 4) c horizon, or soil base ([link]). the o horizon has freshly decomposing organic matterhumusat its surface, with decomposed vegetation at its base. humus enriches the soil with nutrients and enhances soil moisture retention. topsoilthe top layer of soilis usually two to three inches deep, but this depth can vary considerably. for instance, river deltas like the mississippi river delta have deep layers of topsoil. topsoil is rich in organic material; microbial processes occur there, and it is the workhorse of plant production. the a horizon consists of a mixture of organic material with inorganic products of weathering, and it is therefore the beginning of true mineral soil. this horizon is typically darkly colored because of the presence of organic matter. in this area, rainwater percolates through the soil and carries materials from the surface. the bhorizon is an accumulation of mostly fine material that has moved downward, resulting in a dense layer in the soil. in some soils, the b horizon contains nodules or a layer of calcium carbonate. the c horizon, or soil base, includes the parent material, plus the organic and inorganic material that is broken down to form soil. the parent material may be either created in its natural place, or transported from elsewhere to its present location. beneath the c horizon lies bedrock. some soils may have additional layers, or lack one of these layers. the thickness of the layers is also variable, and depends on the factors that influence soil formation. in general, immature soils may have o, a, and c horizons, whereas mature soils may display all of these, plus additional layers ([link]). soil scientista soil scientist studies the biological components, physical and chemical properties, distribution, formation, and morphology of soils. soil scientists need to have a strong background in physical and life sciences, plus a foundation in mathematics. they may work for federal or state agencies, academia, or the private sector. their work may involve collecting data, carrying out research, interpreting results, inspecting soils, conducting soil surveys, and recommending soil management programs. many soil scientists work both in an office and in the field. according to the united states department of agriculture (usda): a soil scientist needs good observation skills to analyze and determine the characteristics of different types of soils. soil types are complex and the geographical areas a soil scientist may survey are varied. aerial photos or various satellite images are often used to research the areas. computer skills and geographic information systems (gis) help the scientist to analyze the multiple facets of geomorphology, topography, vegetation, and climate to discover the patterns left on the landscape.1 soil scientists play a key role in understanding the soils past, analyzing present conditions, and making recommendations for future soil-related practices. plants obtain mineral nutrients from the soil. soil is the outer loose layer that covers the surface of earth. soil quality depends on the chemical composition of the soil, the topography, the presence of living organisms, the climate, and time. agricultural practice and history may also modify the characteristics and fertility of soil. soil consists of four major components: 1) inorganic mineral matter, 2) organic matter, 3) water and air, and 4) living matter. the organic material of soil is made of humus, which improves soil structure and provides water and minerals. soil inorganic material consists of rock slowly broken down into smaller particles that vary in size, such as sand, silt, and loam. soil formation results from a combination of biological, physical, and chemical processes. soil is not homogenous because its formation results in the production of layers called a soil profile. factors that affect soil formation include: parent material, climate, topography, biological factors, and time. soils are classified based on their horizons, soil particle size, and proportions. most soils have four distinct horizons: o, a, b, and c.","[('organic soil', 'organic soils'), ('soil formation', 'soil formations'), ('c horizon', 'c horizons'), ('parent material', 'parent materials'), ('soil climate', 'soil climates'), ('soil horizon', 'soil horizons'), ('rhizosphere', 'rhizospheres'), ('physical property of soil', 'physical property of soils', 'physical properties of soil', 'physical properties of soils'), ('loam', 'loams'), ('sand', 'sand'), ('soil', 'soils'), ('soil composition', 'soil compositions'), ('silt', 'silts'), ('humu', 'humuss', 'humus'), ('plant nutrition', 'plant nutritions'), ('b horizon', 'b horizons'), ('mineral soil', 'mineral soils'), ('soil property', 'soil propertiess', 'soil properties'), ('clay', 'clays'), ('soil profile', 'soil profiles'), ('topography', 'topographies'), ('o horizon', 'o horizons'), ('horizon', 'horizons'), ('soil biology', 'soil biologies'), ('a horizon', 'a horizons')]"
164,stax-bio,31,Soil and Plant Nutrition,3,m44718,Nutritional Adaptations of Plants,"plants obtain food in two different ways. autotrophic plants can make their own food from inorganic raw materials, such as carbon dioxide and water, through photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight. green plants are included in this group. some plants, however, are heterotrophic: they are totally parasitic and lacking in chlorophyll. these plants, referred to as holo-parasitic plants, are unable to synthesize organic carbon and draw all of their nutrients from the host plant. plants may also enlist the help of microbial partners in nutrient acquisition. particular species of bacteria and fungi have evolved along with certain plants to create a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with roots. this improves the nutrition of both the plant and the microbe. the formation of nodules in legume plants and mycorrhization can be considered among the nutritional adaptations of plants. however, these are not the only type of adaptations that we may find; many plants have other adaptations that allow them to thrive under specific conditions. nitrogen is an important macronutrient because it is part of nucleic acids and proteins. atmospheric nitrogen, which is the diatomic molecule n2, or dinitrogen, is the largest pool of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. however, plants cannot take advantage of this nitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes to convert it into biologically useful forms. however, nitrogen can be fixed, which means that it can be converted to ammonia (nh3) through biological, physical, or chemical processes. as you have learned, biological nitrogen fixation (bnf) is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (n2) into ammonia (nh3), exclusively carried out by prokaryotes such as soil bacteria or cyanobacteria. biological processes contribute 65 percent of the nitrogen used in agriculture. the following equation represents the process: the most important source of bnf is the symbiotic interaction between soil bacteria and legume plants, including many crops important to humans ([link]). the nh3 resulting from fixation can be transported into plant tissue and incorporated into amino acids, which are then made into plant proteins. some legume seeds, such as soybeans and peanuts,contain high levels of protein, and serve among the most important agricultural sources of protein in the world. soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules, in which nitrogen fixation takes place. this process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, by means of the enzyme nitrogenase. therefore, using rhizobia is a natural and environmentally friendly way to fertilize plants, as opposed to chemical fertilization that uses a nonrenewable resource, such as natural gas. through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the plant benefits from using an endless source of nitrogen from the atmosphere. the process simultaneously contributes to soil fertility because the plant root system leaves behind some of the biologically available nitrogen. as in any symbiosis, both organisms benefit from the interaction: the plant obtains ammonia, and bacteria obtain carbon compounds generated through photosynthesis, as well as a protected niche in which to grow ([link]). a nutrient depletion zone can develop when there is rapid soil solution uptake, low nutrient concentration, low diffusion rate, or low soil moisture. these conditions are very common; therefore, most plants rely on fungi to facilitate the uptake of minerals from the soil. fungi form symbiotic associations called mycorrhizae with plant roots, in which the fungi actually are integrated into the physical structure of the root. the fungi colonize the living root tissue during active plant growth. through mycorrhization, the plant obtains mainly phosphate and other minerals, such as zinc and copper, from the soil. the fungus obtains nutrients, such as sugars, from the plant root ([link]). mycorrhizae help increase the surface area of the plant root system because hyphae, which are narrow, can spread beyond the nutrient depletion zone. hyphae can grow into small soil pores that allow access to phosphorus that would otherwise be unavailable to the plant. the beneficial effect on the plant is best observed in poor soils. the benefit to fungi is that they can obtain up to 20 percent of the total carbon accessed by plants. mycorrhizae functions as a physical barrier to pathogens. it also provides an induction of generalized host defense mechanisms, and sometimes involves production of antibiotic compounds by the fungi. there are two types of mycorrhizae: ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. ectomycorrhizae form an extensive dense sheath around the roots, called a mantle. hyphae from the fungi extend from the mantle into the soil, which increases the surface area for water and mineral absorption. this type of mycorrhizae is found in forest trees, especially conifers, birches, and oaks. endomycorrhizae, also called arbuscular mycorrhizae, do not form a dense sheath over the root. instead, the fungal mycelium is embedded within the root tissue. endomycorrhizae are found in the roots of more than 80 percent of terrestrial plants. some plants cannot produce their own food and must obtain their nutrition from outside sources. this may occur with plants that are parasitic or saprophytic. some plants are mutualistic symbionts, epiphytes, or insectivorous. a parasitic plant depends on its host for survival. some parasitic plants have no leaves. an example of this is the dodder ([link]), which has a weak, cylindrical stem that coils around the host and forms suckers. from these suckers, cells invade the host stem and grow to connect with the vascular bundles of the host. the parasitic plant obtains water and nutrients through these connections. the plant is a total parasite (a holoparasite) because it is completely dependent on its host. other parasitic plants (hemiparasites) are fully photosynthetic and only use the host for water and minerals. there are about 4,100 species of parasitic plants. a saprophyte is a plant that does not have chlorophyll and gets its food from dead matter, similar to bacteria and fungi (note that fungi are often called saprophytes, which is incorrect, because fungi are not plants). plants like these use enzymes to convert organic food materials into simpler forms from which they can absorb nutrients ([link]). most saprophytes do not directly digest dead matter: instead, they parasitize fungi that digest dead matter, or are mycorrhizal, ultimately obtaining photosynthate from a fungus that derived photosynthate from its host. saprophytic plants are uncommon; only a few species are described. a symbiont is a plant in a symbiotic relationship, with special adaptations such as mycorrhizae or nodule formation. fungi also form symbiotic associations with cyanobacteria and green algae (called lichens). lichens can sometimes be seen as colorful growths on the surface of rocks and trees ([link]). the algal partner (phycobiont) makes food autotrophically, some of which it shares with the fungus; the fungal partner (mycobiont) absorbs water and minerals from the environment, which are made available to the green alga. if one partner was separated from the other, they would both die. an epiphyte is a plant that grows on other plants, but is not dependent upon the other plant for nutrition ([link]). epiphytes have two types of roots: clinging aerial roots, which absorb nutrients from humus that accumulates in the crevices of trees; and aerial roots, which absorb moisture from the atmosphere. an insectivorous plant has specialized leaves to attract and digest insects. the venus flytrap is popularly known for its insectivorous mode of nutrition, and has leaves that work as traps ([link]). the minerals it obtains from prey compensate for those lacking in the boggy (low ph) soil of its native north carolina coastal plains. there are three sensitive hairs in the center of each half of each leaf. the edges of each leaf are covered with long spines. nectar secreted by the plant attracts flies to the leaf. when a fly touches the sensory hairs, the leaf immediately closes. next, fluids and enzymes break down the prey and minerals are absorbed by the leaf. since this plant is popular in the horticultural trade, it is threatened in its original habitat. atmospheric nitrogen is the largest pool of available nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. however, plants cannot use this nitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes. biological nitrogen fixation (bnf) is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia. the most important source of bnf is the symbiotic interaction between soil bacteria and legumes. the bacteria form nodules on the legumes roots in which nitrogen fixation takes place. fungi form symbiotic associations (mycorrhizae) with plants, becoming integrated into the physical structure of the root. through mycorrhization, the plant obtains minerals from the soil and the fungus obtains photosynthate from the plant root. ectomycorrhizae form an extensive dense sheath around the root, while endomycorrhizae are embedded within the root tissue. some plantsparasites, saprophytes, symbionts, epiphytes, and insectivoreshave evolved adaptations to obtain their organic or mineral nutrition from various sources.","[('nitrogen fixation', 'nitrogen fixations'), ('symbiotic relationship', 'symbiotic relationships'), ('rhizobium', 'rhizobias', 'rhizobia'), ('insectivorous plant', 'insectivorous plants'), ('plant parasite', 'plant parasites'), ('parasitic plant', 'parasitic plants'), ('nitrogenase', 'nitrogenases'), ('insectivorou', 'insectivorouss', 'insectivorous'), ('mycorrhiza', 'mycorrhizaes', 'mycorrhizae'), ('fungi and root', 'fungi and rootss', 'fungi and roots', 'fungis and root', 'fungis and rootss', 'fungis and roots'), ('symbiont', 'symbionts'), ('soil', 'soils'), ('plant nutrition', 'plant nutritions'), ('root bacterium interaction', 'root bacterium interactions', 'root bacteria interaction', 'root bacteria interactions', 'roots bacterium interaction', 'roots bacterium interactions', 'roots bacteria interaction', 'roots bacteria interactions'), ('nutritional adaptation', 'nutritional adaptations'), ('saprophyte', 'saprophytess', 'saprophytes'), ('nodule', 'nodules'), ('epiphyte', 'epiphytes')]"
165,stax-bio,32,Plant Reproduction,0,m44720,Introduction,"plants have evolved different reproductive strategies for the continuation of their species. some plants reproduce sexually, and others asexually, in contrast to animal species, which rely almost exclusively on sexual reproduction. plant sexual reproduction usually depends on pollinating agents, while asexual reproduction is independent of these agents. flowers are often the showiest or most strongly scented part of plants. with their bright colors, fragrances, and interesting shapes and sizes, flowers attract insects, birds, and animals to serve their pollination needs. other plants pollinate via wind or water;

166,stax-bio,32,Plant Reproduction,1,m44722,Reproductive Development and Structure,"sexual reproduction takes place with slight variations in different groups of plants. plants have two distinct stages in their lifecycle: the gametophyte stage and the sporophyte stage. the haploid gametophyte produces the male and female gametes by mitosis in distinct multicellular structures. fusion of the male and females gametes forms the diploid zygote, which develops into the sporophyte. after reaching maturity, the diploid sporophyte produces spores by meiosis, which in turn divide by mitosis to produce the haploid gametophyte. the new gametophyte produces gametes, and the cycle continues. this is the alternation of generations, and is typical of plant reproduction ([link]). the life cycle of higher plants is dominated by the sporophyte stage, with the gametophyte borne on the sporophyte. in ferns, the gametophyte is free-living and very distinct in structure from the diploid sporophyte. in bryophytes, such as mosses, the haploid gametophyte is more developed than the sporophyte. during the vegetative phase of growth, plants increase in size and produce a shoot system and a root system. as they enter the reproductive phase, some of the branches start to bear flowers. many flowers are borne singly, whereas some are borne in clusters. the flower is borne on a stalk known as a receptacle. flower shape, color, and size are unique to each species, and are often used by taxonomists to classify plants. the lifecycle of angiosperms follows the alternation of generations explained previously. the haploid gametophyte alternates with the diploid sporophyte during the sexual reproduction process of angiosperms. flowers contain the plants reproductive structures. a typical flower has four main partsor whorlsknown as the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium ([link]). the outermost whorl of the flower has green, leafy structures known as sepals. the sepals, collectively called the calyx, help to protect the unopened bud. the second whorl is comprised of petalsusually, brightly coloredcollectively called the corolla. the number of sepals and petals varies depending on whether the plant is a monocot or dicot. in monocots, petals usually number three or multiples of three; in dicots, the number of petals is four or five, or multiples of four and five. together, the calyx and corolla are known as the perianth. the third whorl contains the male reproductive structures and is known as the androecium. the androecium has stamens with anthers that contain the microsporangia. the innermost group of structures in the flower is the gynoecium, or the female reproductive component(s). the carpel is the individual unit of the gynoecium and has a stigma, style, and ovary. a flower may have one or multiple carpels. if all four whorls (the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium) are present, the flower is described as complete. if any of the four parts is missing, the flower is known as incomplete. flowers that contain both an androecium and a gynoecium are called perfect, androgynous or hermaphrodites. there are two types of incomplete flowers: staminate flowers contain only an androecium, and carpellate flowers have only a gynoecium ([link]). if both male and female flowers are borne on the same plant, the species is called monoecious (meaning one home): examples are corn and pea. species with male and female flowers borne on separate plants are termed dioecious, or two homes, examples of which are c. papaya and cannabis. the ovary, which may contain one or multiple ovules, may be placed above other flower parts, which is referred to as superior; or, it may be placed below the other flower parts, referred to as inferior ([link]). the male gametophyte develops and reaches maturity in an immature anther. in a plants male reproductive organs, development of pollen takes place in a structure known as the microsporangium ([link]). the microsporangia, which are usually bi-lobed, are pollen sacs in which the microspores develop into pollen grains. these are found in the anther, which is at the end of the stamenthe long filament that supports the anther. within the microsporangium, the microspore mother cell divides by meiosis to give rise to four microspores, each of which will ultimately form a pollen grain ([link]). an inner layer of cells, known as the tapetum, provides nutrition to the developing microspores and contributes key components to the pollen wall. mature pollen grains contain two cells: a generative cell and a pollen tube cell. the generative cell is contained within the larger pollen tube cell. upon germination, the tube cell forms the pollen tube through which the generative cell migrates to enter the ovary. during its transit inside the pollen tube, the generative cell divides to form two male gametes (sperm cells). upon maturity, the microsporangia burst, releasing the pollen grains from the anther. each pollen grain has two coverings: the exine (thicker, outer layer) and the intine ([link]). the exine contains sporopollenin, a complex waterproofing substance supplied by the tapetal cells. sporopollenin allows the pollen to survive under unfavorable conditions and to be carried by wind, water, or biological agents without undergoing damage. while the details may vary between species, the overall development of the female gametophyte has two distinct phases. first, in the process of megasporogenesis, a single cell in the diploid megasporangiuman area of tissue in the ovulesundergoes meiosis to produce four megaspores, only one of which survives. during the second phase, megagametogenesis, the surviving haploid megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce an eight-nucleate, seven-cell female gametophyte, also known as the megagametophyte or embryo sac. two of the nucleithe polar nucleimove to the equator and fuse, forming a single, diploid central cell. this central cell later fuses with a sperm to form the triploid endosperm. three nuclei position themselves on the end of the embryo sac opposite the micropyle and develop into the antipodal cells, which later degenerate. the nucleus closest to the micropyle becomes the female gamete, or egg cell, and the two adjacent nuclei develop into synergid cells ([link]). the synergids help guide the pollen tube for successful fertilization, after which they disintegrate. once fertilization is complete, the resulting diploid zygote develops into the embryo, and the fertilized ovule forms the other tissues of the seed. a double-layered integument protects the megasporangium and, later, the embryo sac. the integument will develop into the seed coat after fertilization and protect the entire seed. the ovule wall will become part of the fruit. the integuments, while protecting the megasporangium, do not enclose it completely, but leave an opening called the micropyle. the micropyle allows the pollen tube to enter the female gametophyte for fertilization. as with angiosperms, the lifecycle of a gymnosperm is also characterized by alternation of generations. in conifers such as pines, the green leafy part of the plant is the sporophyte, and the cones contain the male and female gametophytes ([link]). the female cones are larger than the male cones and are positioned towards the top of the tree; the small, male cones are located in the lower region of the tree. because the pollen is shed and blown by the wind, this arrangement makes it difficult for a gymnosperm to self-pollinate. a male cone has a central axis on which bracts, a type of modified leaf, are attached. the bracts are known as microsporophylls ([link]) and are the sites where microspores will develop. the microspores develop inside the microsporangium. within the microsporangium, cells known as microsporocytes divide by meiosis to produce four haploid microspores. further mitosis of the microspore produces two nuclei: the generative nucleus, and the tube nucleus. upon maturity, the male gametophyte (pollen) is released from the male cones and is carried by the wind to land on the female cone. watch this video to see a cedar releasing its pollen in the wind.

 the female cone also has a central axis on which bracts known as megasporophylls ([link]) are present. in the female cone, megaspore mother cells are present in the megasporangium. the megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis to produce four haploid megaspores. one of the megaspores divides to form the multicellular female gametophyte, while the others divide to form the rest of the structure. the female gametophyte is contained within a structure called the archegonium. upon landing on the female cone, the tube cell of the pollen forms the pollen tube, through which the generative cell migrates towards the female gametophyte through the micropyle. it takes approximately one year for the pollen tube to grow and migrate towards the female gametophyte. the male gametophyte containing the generative cell splits into two sperm nuclei, one of which fuses with the egg, while the other degenerates. after fertilization of the egg, the diploid zygote is formed, which divides by mitosis to form the embryo. the scales of the cones are closed during development of the seed. the seed is covered by a seed coat, which is derived from the female sporophyte. seed development takes another one to two years. once the seed is ready to be dispersed, the bracts of the female cones open to allow the dispersal of seed; no fruit formation takes place because gymnosperm seeds have no covering. gymnosperm reproduction differs from that of angiosperms in several ways ([link]). in angiosperms, the female gametophyte exists in an enclosed structurethe ovulewhich is within the ovary; in gymnosperms, the female gametophyte is present on exposed bracts of the female cone. double fertilization is a key event in the lifecycle of angiosperms, but is completely absent in gymnosperms. the male and female gametophyte structures are present on separate male and female cones in gymnosperms, whereas in angiosperms, they are a part of the flower. lastly, wind plays an important role in pollination in gymnosperms because pollen is blown by the wind to land on the female cones. although many angiosperms are also wind-pollinated, animal pollination is more common. view an animation of the double fertilization process of angiosperms.

 the flower contains the reproductive structures of a plant. all complete flowers contain four whorls: the calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. the stamens are made up of anthers, in which pollen grains are produced, and a supportive strand called the filament. the pollen contains two cells a generative cell and a tube celland is covered by two layers called the intine and the exine. the carpels, which are the female reproductive structures, consist of the stigma, style, and ovary. the female gametophyte is formed from mitotic divisions of the megaspore, forming an eight-nuclei ovule sac. this is covered by a layer known as the integument. the integument contains an opening called the micropyle, through which the pollen tube enters the embryo sac. the diploid sporophyte of angiosperms and gymnosperms is the conspicuous and long-lived stage of the life cycle.  the sporophytes differentiate specialized reproductive structures called sporangia, which are dedicated to the production of spores.  the microsporangium contains microspore mother cells, which divide by meiosis to produce haploid microspores.  the microspores develop into male gametophytes that are released as pollen.  the megasporangium contains megaspore mother cells, which divide by meiosis to produce haploid megaspores.  a megaspore develops into a female gametophyte containing a haploid egg.  a new diploid sporophyte is formed when a male gamete from a pollen grain enters the ovule sac and fertilizes this egg.","[('plant sexual reproduction', 'plant sexual reproductions', 'plants sexual reproduction', 'plants sexual reproductions'), ('androecium', 'androeciums'), ('plant reproductive structure', 'plant reproductive structures', 'plants reproductive structure', 'plants reproductive structures'), ('micropyle', 'micropyles'), ('microsporangium', 'microsporangiums'), ('gymnosperm sexual reproduction', 'gymnosperm sexual reproductions', 'gymnosperms sexual reproduction', 'gymnosperms sexual reproductions'), ('intine', 'intines'), ('female gamete', 'female gametes'), ('polar nuclei', 'polar nucleis'), ('polar body', 'polar bodies'), ('plant reproductive proces', 'plant reproductive processes', 'plant reproductive process', 'plants reproductive proces', 'plants reproductive processes', 'plants reproductive process'), ('microsporophyll', 'microsporophylls'), ('exine', 'exines'), ('megasporangium', 'megasporangiums'), ('plant reproduction', 'plant reproductions'), ('antipodal', 'antipodals'), ('female gametophyte', 'female gametophytes'), ('flower structure', 'flower structures'), ('complete flower', 'complete flowers'), ('angiosperm', 'angiosperms'), ('angiosperm reproduction', 'angiosperm reproductions'), ('plant lifecycle', 'plant lifecycles'), ('flower reproduction', 'flower reproductions'), ('plant reproductive development', 'plant reproductive developments', 'plants reproductive development', 'plants reproductive developments'), ('synergid', 'synergids'), ('perianth', 'perianths'), ('angiosperm sexual reproduction', 'angiosperm sexual reproductions', 'angiosperms sexual reproduction', 'angiosperms sexual reproductions'), ('male gametophyte', 'male gametophytes'), ('gymnosperm reproduction', 'gymnosperm reproductions')]"
167,stax-bio,32,Plant Reproduction,2,m44723,Pollination and Fertilization,"in angiosperms, pollination is defined as the placement or transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower. in gymnosperms, pollination involves pollen transfer from the male cone to the female cone. upon transfer, the pollen germinates to form the pollen tube and the sperm for fertilizing the egg. pollination has been well studied since the time of gregor mendel. mendel successfully carried out self- as well as cross-pollination in garden peas while studying how characteristics were passed on from one generation to the next. todays crops are a result of plant breeding, which employs artificial selection to produce the present-day cultivars. a case in point is today's corn, which is a result of years of breeding that started with its ancestor, teosinte. the teosinte that the ancient mayans originally began cultivating had tiny seedsvastly different from todays relatively giant ears of corn. interestingly, though these two plants appear to be entirely different, the genetic difference between them is miniscule. pollination takes two forms: self-pollination and cross-pollination. self-pollination occurs when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species. self-pollination occurs in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flowers stigma. this method of pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators. living species are designed to ensure survival of their progeny; those that fail become extinct. genetic diversity is therefore required so that in changing environmental or stress conditions, some of the progeny can survive. self-pollination leads to the production of plants with less genetic diversity, since genetic material from the same plant is used to form gametes, and eventually, the zygote. in contrast, cross-pollinationor out-crossingleads to greater genetic diversity because the microgametophyte and megagametophyte are derived from different plants. because cross-pollination allows for more genetic diversity, plants have developed many ways to avoid self-pollination. in some species, the pollen and the ovary mature at different times. these flowers make self-pollination nearly impossible. by the time pollen matures and has been shed, the stigma of this flower is mature and can only be pollinated by pollen from another flower. some flowers have developed physical features that prevent self-pollination. the primrose is one such flower. primroses have evolved two flower types with differences in anther and stigma length: the pin-eyed flower has anthers positioned at the pollen tubes halfway point, and the thrum-eyed flowers stigma is likewise located at the halfway point. insects easily cross-pollinate while seeking the nectar at the bottom of the pollen tube. this phenomenon is also known as heterostyly. many plants, such as cucumber, have male and female flowers located on different parts of the plant, thus making self-pollination difficult. in yet other species, the male and female flowers are borne on different plants (dioecious). all of these are barriers to self-pollination; therefore, the plants depend on pollinators to transfer pollen. the majority of pollinators are biotic agents such as insects (like bees, flies, and butterflies), bats, birds, and other animals. other plant species are pollinated by abiotic agents, such as wind and water. incompatibility genes in flowersin recent decades, incompatibility geneswhich prevent pollen from germinating or growing into the stigma of a flowerhave been discovered in many angiosperm species. if plants do not have compatible genes, the pollen tube stops growing. self-incompatibility is controlled by the s(sterility) locus. pollen tubes have to grow through the tissue of the stigma and style before they can enter the ovule. the carpel is selective in the type of pollen it allows to grow inside. the interaction is primarily between the pollen and the stigma epidermal cells. in some plants, like cabbage, the pollen is rejected at the surface of the stigma, and the unwanted pollen does not germinate. in other plants, pollen tube germination is arrested after growing one-third the length of the style, leading to pollen tube death. pollen tube death is due either to apoptosis (programmed cell death) or to degradation of pollen tube rna. the degradation results from the activity of a ribonuclease encoded by the s locus. the ribonuclease is secreted from the cells of the style in the extracellular matrix, which lies alongside the growing pollen tube. in summary, self-incompatibility is a mechanism that prevents self-fertilization in many flowering plant species. the working of this self-incompatibility mechanism has important consequences for plant breeders because it inhibits the production of inbred and hybrid plants. bees are perhaps the most important pollinator of many garden plants and most commercial fruit trees ([link]). the most common species of bees are bumblebees and honeybees. since bees cannot see the color red, bee-pollinated flowers usually have shades of blue, yellow, or other colors. bees collect energy-rich pollen or nectar for their survival and energy needs. they visit flowers that are open during the day, are brightly colored, have a strong aroma or scent, and have a tubular shape, typically with the presence of a nectar guide. a nectar guide includes regions on the flower petals that are visible only to bees, and not to humans; it helps to guide bees to the center of the flower, thus making the pollination process more efficient. the pollen sticks to the bees fuzzy hair, and when the bee visits another flower, some of the pollen is transferred to the second flower. recently, there have been many reports about the declining population of honeybees. many flowers will remain unpollinated and not bear seed if honeybees disappear. the impact on commercial fruit growers could be devastating. many flies are attracted to flowers that have a decaying smell or an odor of rotting flesh. these flowers, which produce nectar, usually have dull colors, such as brown or purple. they are found on the corpse flower or voodoo lily (amorphophallus), dragon arum (dracunculus), and carrion flower (stapleia, rafflesia). the nectar provides energy, whereas the pollen provides protein. wasps are also important insect pollinators, and pollinate many species of figs. butterflies, such as the monarch, pollinate many garden flowers and wildflowers, which usually occur in clusters. these flowers are brightly colored, have a strong fragrance, are open during the day, and have nectar guides to make access to nectar easier. the pollen is picked up and carried on the butterflys limbs. moths, on the other hand, pollinate flowers during the late afternoon and night. the flowers pollinated by moths are pale or white and are flat, enabling the moths to land. one well-studied example of a moth-pollinated plant is the yucca plant, which is pollinated by the yucca moth. the shape of the flower and moth have adapted in such a way as to allow successful pollination. the moth deposits pollen on the sticky stigma for fertilization to occur later. the female moth also deposits eggs into the ovary. as the eggs develop into larvae, they obtain food from the flower and developing seeds. thus, both the insect and flower benefit from each other in this symbiotic relationship. the corn earworm moth and gaura plant have a similar relationship ([link]). in the tropics and deserts, bats are often the pollinators of nocturnal flowers such as agave, guava, and morning glory. the flowers are usually large and white or pale-colored; thus, they can be distinguished from the dark surroundings at night. the flowers have a strong, fruity, or musky fragrance and produce large amounts of nectar. they are naturally large and wide-mouthed to accommodate the head of the bat. as the bats seek the nectar, their faces and heads become covered with pollen, which is then transferred to the next flower. many species of small birds, such as the hummingbird ([link]) and sun birds, are pollinators for plants such as orchids and other wildflowers. flowers visited by birds are usually sturdy and are oriented in such a way as to allow the birds to stay near the flower without getting their wings entangled in the nearby flowers. the flower typically has a curved, tubular shape, which allows access for the birds beak. brightly colored, odorless flowers that are open during the day are pollinated by birds. as a bird seeks energy-rich nectar, pollen is deposited on the birds head and neck and is then transferred to the next flower it visits. botanists have been known to determine the range of extinct plants by collecting and identifying pollen from 200-year-old bird specimens from the same site. most species of conifers, and many angiosperms, such as grasses, maples and oaks, are pollinated by wind. pine cones are brown and unscented, while the flowers of wind-pollinated angiosperm species are usually green, small, may have small or no petals, and produce large amounts of pollen. unlike the typical insect-pollinated flowers, flowers adapted to pollination by wind do not produce nectar or scent. in wind-pollinated species, the microsporangia hang out of the flower, and, as the wind blows, the lightweight pollen is carried with it ([link]). the flowers usually emerge early in the spring, before the leaves, so that the leaves do not block the movement of the wind. the pollen is deposited on the exposed feathery stigma of the flower ([link]). some weeds, such as australian sea grass and pond weeds, are pollinated by water. the pollen floats on water, and when it comes into contact with the flower, it is deposited inside the flower. pollination by deceptionorchids are highly valued flowers, with many rare varieties ([link]). they grow in a range of specific habitats, mainly in the tropics of asia, south america, and central america. at least 25,000 species of orchids have been identified. flowers often attract pollinators with food rewards, in the form of nectar. however, some species of orchid are an exception to this standard: they have evolved different ways to attract the desired pollinators. they use a method known as food deception, in which bright colors and perfumes are offered, but no food. anacamptis morio, commonly known as the green-winged orchid, bears bright purple flowers and emits a strong scent. the bumblebee, its main pollinator, is attracted to the flower because of the strong scentwhich usually indicates food for a beeand in the process, picks up the pollen to be transported to another flower. other orchids use sexual deception. chiloglottis trapeziformis emits a compound that smells the same as the pheromone emitted by a female wasp to attract male wasps. the male wasp is attracted to the scent, lands on the orchid flower, and in the process, transfers pollen. some orchids, like the australian hammer orchid, use scent as well as visual trickery in yet another sexual deception strategy to attract wasps. the flower of this orchid mimics the appearance of a female wasp and emits a pheromone. the male wasp tries to mate with what appears to be a female wasp, and in the process, picks up pollen, which it then transfers to the next counterfeit mate. after pollen is deposited on the stigma, it must germinate and grow through the style to reach the ovule. the microspores, or the pollen, contain two cells: the pollen tube cell and the generative cell. the pollen tube cell grows into a pollen tube through which the generative cell travels. the germination of the pollen tube requires water, oxygen, and certain chemical signals. as it travels through the style to reach the embryo sac, the pollen tubes growth is supported by the tissues of the style. in the meantime, if the generative cell has not already split into two cells, it now divides to form two sperm cells. the pollen tube is guided by the chemicals secreted by the synergids present in the embryo sac, and it enters the ovule sac through the micropyle. of the two sperm cells, one sperm fertilizes the egg cell, forming a diploid zygote; the other sperm fuses with the two polar nuclei, forming a triploid cell that develops into the endosperm. together, these two fertilization events in angiosperms are known as double fertilization ([link]). after fertilization is complete, no other sperm can enter. the fertilized ovule forms the seed, whereas the tissues of the ovary become the fruit, usually enveloping the seed. after fertilization, the zygote divides to form two cells: the upper cell, or terminal cell, and the lower, or basal, cell. the division of the basal cell gives rise to the suspensor, which eventually makes connection with the maternal tissue. the suspensor provides a route for nutrition to be transported from the mother plant to the growing embryo. the terminal cell also divides, giving rise to a globular-shaped proembryo ([link]a). in dicots (eudicots), the developing embryo has a heart shape, due to the presence of the two rudimentary cotyledons ([link]b). in non-endospermic dicots, such as capsella bursa, the endosperm develops initially, but is then digested, and the food reserves are moved into the two cotyledons. as the embryo and cotyledons enlarge, they run out of room inside the developing seed, and are forced to bend ([link]c). ultimately, the embryo and cotyledons fill the seed ([link]d), and the seed is ready for dispersal. embryonic development is suspended after some time, and growth is resumed only when the seed germinates. the developing seedling will rely on the food reserves stored in the cotyledons until the first set of leaves begin photosynthesis. the mature ovule develops into the seed. a typical seed contains a seed coat, cotyledons, endosperm, and a single embryo ([link]). the storage of food reserves in angiosperm seeds differs between monocots and dicots. in monocots, such as corn and wheat, the single cotyledon is called a scutellum; the scutellum is connected directly to the embryo via vascular tissue (xylem and phloem). food reserves are stored in the large endosperm. upon germination, enzymes are secreted by the aleurone, a single layer of cells just inside the seed coat that surrounds the endosperm and embryo. the enzymes degrade the stored carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, the products of which are absorbed by the scutellum and transported via a vasculature strand to the developing embryo. therefore, the scutellum can be seen to be an absorptive organ, not a storage organ. the two cotyledons in the dicot seed also have vascular connections to the embryo. in endospermic dicots, the food reserves are stored in the endosperm. during germination, the two cotyledons therefore act as absorptive organs to take up the enzymatically released food reserves, much like in monocots (monocots, by definition, also have endospermic seeds). tobacco (nicotiana tabaccum), tomato (solanum lycopersicum), and pepper (capsicum annuum) are examples of endospermic dicots. in non-endospermic dicots, the triploid endosperm develops normally following double fertilization, but the endosperm food reserves are quickly remobilized and moved into the developing cotyledon for storage. the two halves of a peanut seed (arachis hypogaea) and the split peas (pisum sativum) of split pea soup are individual cotyledons loaded with food reserves. the seed, along with the ovule, is protected by a seed coat that is formed from the integuments of the ovule sac. in dicots, the seed coat is further divided into an outer coat known as the testa and inner coat known as the tegmen. the embryonic axis consists of three parts: the plumule, the radicle, and the hypocotyl. the portion of the embryo between the cotyledon attachment point and the radicle is known as the hypocotyl (hypocotyl means below the cotyledons). the embryonic axis terminates in a radicle (the embryonic root), which is the region from which the root will develop. in dicots, the hypocotyls extend above ground, giving rise to the stem of the plant. in monocots, the hypocotyl does not show above ground because monocots do not exhibit stem elongation. the part of the embryonic axis that projects above the cotyledons is known as the epicotyl. the plumule is composed of the epicotyl, young leaves, and the shoot apical meristem. upon germination in dicot seeds, the epicotyl is shaped like a hook with the plumule pointing downwards. this shape is called the plumule hook, and it persists as long as germination proceeds in the dark. therefore, as the epicotyl pushes through the tough and abrasive soil, the plumule is protected from damage. upon exposure to light, the hypocotyl hook straightens out, the young foliage leaves face the sun and expand, and the epicotyl continues to elongate. during this time, the radicle is also growing and producing the primary root. as it grows downward to form the tap root, lateral roots branch off to all sides, producing the typical dicot tap root system. in monocot seeds ([link]), the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused. as the seed germinates, the primary root emerges, protected by the root-tip covering: the coleorhiza. next, the primary shoot emerges, protected by the coleoptile: the covering of the shoot tip. upon exposure to light (i.e. when the plumule has exited the soil and the protective coleoptile is no longer needed), elongation of the coleoptile ceases and the leaves expand and unfold. at the other end of the embryonic axis, the primary root soon dies, while other, adventitious roots (roots that do not arise from the usual place  i.e. the root) emerge from the base of the stem. this gives the monocot a fibrous root system. many mature seeds enter a period of inactivity, or extremely low metabolic activity: a process known as dormancy, which may last for months, years or even centuries. dormancy helps keep seeds viable during unfavorable conditions. upon a return to favorable conditions, seed germination takes place. favorable conditions could be as diverse as moisture, light, cold, fire, or chemical treatments. after heavy rains, many new seedlings emerge. forest fires also lead to the emergence of new seedlings. some seeds require vernalization (cold treatment) before they can germinate. this guarantees that seeds produced by plants in temperate climates will not germinate until the spring. plants growing in hot climates may have seeds that need a heat treatment in order to germinate, to avoid germination in the hot, dry summers. in many seeds, the presence of a thick seed coat retards the ability to germinate. scarification, which includes mechanical or chemical processes to soften the seed coat, is often employed before germination. presoaking in hot water, or passing through an acid environment, such as an animals digestive tract, may also be employed. depending on seed size, the time taken for a seedling to emerge may vary. species with large seeds have enough food reserves to germinate deep below ground, and still extend their epicotyl all the way to the soil surface. seeds of small-seeded species usually require light as a germination cue. this ensures the seeds only germinate at or near the soil surface (where the light is greatest). if they were to germinate too far underneath the surface, the developing seedling would not have enough food reserves to reach the sunlight. after fertilization, the ovary of the flower usually develops into the fruit. fruits are usually associated with having a sweet taste; however, not all fruits are sweet. botanically, the term fruit is used for a ripened ovary. in most cases, flowers in which fertilization has taken place will develop into fruits, and flowers in which fertilization has not taken place will not. some fruits develop from the ovary and are known as true fruits, whereas others develop from other parts of the female gametophyte and are known as accessory fruits. the fruit encloses the seeds and the developing embryo, thereby providing it with protection. fruits are of many types, depending on their origin and texture. the sweet tissue of the blackberry, the red flesh of the tomato, the shell of the peanut, and the hull of corn (the tough, thin part that gets stuck in your teeth when you eat popcorn) are all fruits. as the fruit matures, the seeds also mature. fruits may be classified as simple, aggregate, multiple, or accessory, depending on their origin ([link]). if the fruit develops from a single carpel or fused carpels of a single ovary, it is known as a simple fruit, as seen in nuts and beans. an aggregate fruit is one that develops from more than one carpel, but all are in the same flower: the mature carpels fuse together to form the entire fruit, as seen in the raspberry. multiple fruit develops from an inflorescence or a cluster of flowers. an example is the pineapple, where the flowers fuse together to form the fruit. accessory fruits (sometimes called false fruits) are not derived from the ovary, but from another part of the flower, such as the receptacle (strawberry) or the hypanthium (apples and pears). fruits generally have three parts: the exocarp (the outermost skin or covering), the mesocarp (middle part of the fruit), and the endocarp (the inner part of the fruit). together, all three are known as the pericarp. the mesocarp is usually the fleshy, edible part of the fruit; however, in some fruits, such as the almond, the endocarp is the edible part. in many fruits, two or all three of the layers are fused, and are indistinguishable at maturity. fruits can be dry or fleshy. furthermore, fruits can be divided into dehiscent or indehiscent types. dehiscent fruits, such as peas, readily release their seeds, while indehiscent fruits, like peaches, rely on decay to release their seeds. the fruit has a single purpose: seed dispersal. seeds contained within fruits need to be dispersed far from the mother plant, so they may find favorable and less competitive conditions in which to germinate and grow. some fruit have built-in mechanisms so they can disperse by themselves, whereas others require the help of agents like wind, water, and animals ([link]). modifications in seed structure, composition, and size help in dispersal. wind-dispersed fruit are lightweight and may have wing-like appendages that allow them to be carried by the wind. some have a parachute-like structure to keep them afloat. some fruitsfor example, the dandelionhave hairy, weightless structures that are suited to dispersal by wind. seeds dispersed by water are contained in light and buoyant fruit, giving them the ability to float. coconuts are well known for their ability to float on water to reach land where they can germinate. similarly, willow and silver birches produce lightweight fruit that can float on water. animals and birds eat fruits, and the seeds that are not digested are excreted in their droppings some distance away. some animals, like squirrels, bury seed-containing fruits for later use; if the squirrel does not find its stash of fruit, and if conditions are favorable, the seeds germinate. some fruits, like the cocklebur, have hooks or sticky structures that stick to an animal's coat and are then transported to another place. humans also play a big role in dispersing seeds when they carry fruits to new places and throw away the inedible part that contains the seeds. all of the above mechanisms allow for seeds to be dispersed through space, much like an animals offspring can move to a new location. seed dormancy, which was described earlier, allows plants to disperse their progeny through time: something animals cannot do. dormant seeds can wait months, years, or even decades for the proper conditions for germination and propagation of the species. for fertilization to occur in angiosperms, pollen has to be transferred to the stigma of a flower: a process known as pollination. gymnosperm pollination involves the transfer of pollen from a male cone to a female cone. when the pollen of the flower is transferred to the stigma of the same flower, it is called self-pollination. cross-pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from one flower to another flower on the same plant, or another plant. cross-pollination requires pollinating agents such as water, wind, or animals, and increases genetic diversity. after the pollen lands on the stigma, the tube cell gives rise to the pollen tube, through which the generative nucleus migrates. the pollen tube gains entry through the micropyle on the ovule sac. the generative cell divides to form two sperm cells: one fuses with the egg to form the diploid zygote, and the other fuses with the polar nuclei to form the endosperm, which is triploid in nature. this is known as double fertilization. after fertilization, the zygote divides to form the embryo and the fertilized ovule forms the seed. the walls of the ovary form the fruit in which the seeds develop. the seed, when mature, will germinate under favorable conditions and give rise to the diploid sporophyte.","[('cross-pollination', 'cross-pollinations'), ('plant sexual reproduction', 'plant sexual reproductions', 'plants sexual reproduction', 'plants sexual reproductions'),

168,stax-bio,32,Plant Reproduction,3,m44725,Asexual Reproduction,"many plants are able to propagate themselves using asexual reproduction. this method does not require the investment required to produce a flower, attract pollinators, or find a means of seed dispersal. asexual reproduction produces plants that are genetically identical to the parent plant because no mixing of male and female gametes takes place. traditionally, these plants survive well under stable environmental conditions when compared with plants produced from sexual reproduction because they carry genes identical to those of their parents. many different types of roots exhibit asexual reproduction [link]. the corm is used by gladiolus and garlic. bulbs, such as a scaly bulb in lilies and a tunicate bulb in daffodils, are other common examples. a potato is a stem tuber, while parsnip propagates from a taproot. ginger and iris produce rhizomes, while ivy uses an adventitious root (a root arising from a plant part other than the main or primary root), and the strawberry plant has a stolon, which is also called a runner. some plants can produce seeds without fertilization. either the ovule or part of the ovary, which is diploid in nature, gives rise to a new seed. this method of reproduction is known as apomixis. an advantage of asexual reproduction is that the resulting plant will reach maturity faster. since the new plant is arising from an adult plant or plant parts, it will also be sturdier than a seedling. asexual reproduction can take place by natural or artificial (assisted by humans) means. natural methods of asexual reproduction include strategies that plants have developed to self-propagate. many plantslike ginger, onion, gladioli, and dahliacontinue to grow from buds that are present on the surface of the stem. in some plants, such as the sweet potato, adventitious roots or runners can give rise to new plants [link]. in bryophyllum and kalanchoe, the leaves have small buds on their margins. when these are detached from the plant, they grow into independent plants; or, they may start growing into independent plants if the leaf touches the soil. some plants can be propagated through cuttings alone. these methods are frequently employed to give rise to new, and sometimes novel, plants. they include grafting, cutting, layering, and micropropagation. grafting has long been used to produce novel varieties of roses, citrus species, and other plants. in grafting, two plant species are used; part of the stem of the desirable plant is grafted onto a rooted plant called the stock. the part that is grafted or attached is called the scion. both are cut at an oblique angle (any angle other than a right angle), placed in close contact with each other, and are then held together [link]. matching up these two surfaces as closely as possible is extremely important because these will be holding the plant together. the vascular systems of the two plants grow and fuse, forming a graft. after a period of time, the scion starts producing shoots, and eventually starts bearing flowers and fruits. grafting is widely used in viticulture (grape growing) and the citrus industry. scions capable of producing a particular fruit variety are grated onto root stock with specific resistance to disease. plants such as coleus and money plant are propagated through stem cuttings, where a portion of the stem containing nodes and internodes is placed in moist soil and allowed to root. in some species, stems can start producing a root even when placed only in water. for example, leaves of the african violet will root if kept in water undisturbed for several weeks. layering is a method in which a stem attached to the plant is bent and covered with soil. young stems that can be bent easily without any injury are preferred. jasmine and bougainvillea (paper flower) can be propagated this way [link]. in some plants, a modified form of layering known as air layering is employed. a portion of the bark or outermost covering of the stem is removed and covered with moss, which is then taped. some gardeners also apply rooting hormone. after some time, roots will appear, and this portion of the plant can be removed and transplanted into a separate pot. micropropagation (also called plant tissue culture) is a method of propagating a large number of plants from a single plant in a short time under laboratory conditions [link]. this method allows propagation of rare, endangered species that may be difficult to grow under natural conditions, are economically important, or are in demand as disease-free plants. to start plant tissue culture, a part of the plant such as a stem, leaf, embryo, anther, or seed can be used. the plant material is thoroughly sterilized using a combination of chemical treatments standardized for that species. under sterile conditions, the plant material is placed on a plant tissue culture medium that contains all the minerals, vitamins, and hormones required by the plant. the plant part often gives rise to an undifferentiated mass known as callus, from which individual plantlets begin to grow after a period of time. these can be separated and are first grown under greenhouse conditions before they are moved to field conditions. the length of time from the beginning of development to the death of a plant is called its life span. the life cycle, on the other hand, is the sequence of stages a plant goes through from seed germination to seed production of the mature plant. some plants, such as annuals, only need a few weeks to grow, produce seeds and die. other plants, such as the bristlecone pine, live for thousands of years. some bristlecone pines have a documented age of 4,500 years [link]. even as some parts of a plant, such as regions containing meristematic tissuethe area of active plant growth consisting of undifferentiated cells capable of cell divisioncontinue to grow, some parts undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). the cork found on stems, and the water-conducting tissue of the xylem, for example, are composed of dead cells. plant species that complete their lifecycle in one season are known as annuals, an example of which is arabidopsis, or mouse-ear cress. biennials such as carrots complete their lifecycle in two seasons. in a biennials first season, the plant has a vegetative phase, whereas in the next season, it completes its reproductive phase. commercial growers harvest the carrot roots after the first year of growth, and do not allow the plants to flower. perennials, such as the magnolia, complete their lifecycle in two years or more. in another classification based on flowering frequency, monocarpic plants flower only once in their lifetime; examples include bamboo and yucca. during the vegetative period of their life cycle (which may be as long as 120 years in some bamboo species), these plants may reproduce asexually and accumulate a great deal of food material that will be required during their once-in-a-lifetime flowering and setting of seed after fertilization. soon after flowering, these plants die. polycarpic plants form flowers many times during their lifetime. fruit trees, such as apple and orange trees, are polycarpic; they flower every year. other polycarpic species, such as perennials, flower several times during their life span, but not each year. by this means, the plant does not require all its nutrients to be channelled towards flowering each year. as is the case with all living organisms, genetics and environmental conditions have a role to play in determining how long a plant will live. susceptibility to disease, changing environmental conditions, drought, cold, and competition for nutrients are some of the factors that determine the survival of a plant. plants continue to grow, despite the presence of dead tissue such as cork. individual parts of plants, such as flowers and leaves, have different rates of survival. in many trees, the older leaves turn yellow and eventually fall from the tree. leaf fall is triggered by factors such as a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency, due to shading by upper leaves, or oxidative damage incurred as a result of photosynthetic reactions. the components of the part to be shed are recycled by the plant for use in other processes, such as development of seed and storage. this process is known as nutrient recycling. the aging of a plant and all the associated processes is known as senescence, which is marked by several complex biochemical changes. one of the characteristics of senescence is the breakdown of chloroplasts, which is characterized by the yellowing of leaves. the chloroplasts contain components of photosynthetic machinery such as membranes and proteins. chloroplasts also contain dna. the proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids are broken down by specific enzymes into smaller molecules and salvaged by the plant to support the growth of other plant tissues. the complex pathways of nutrient recycling within a plant are not well understood. hormones are known to play a role in senescence. applications of cytokinins and ethylene delay or prevent senescence; in contrast, abscissic acid causes premature onset of senescence. many plants reproduce asexually as well as sexually. in asexual reproduction, part of the parent plant is used to generate a new plant. grafting, layering, and micropropagation are some methods used for artificial asexual reproduction. the new plant is genetically identical to the parent plant from which the stock has been taken. asexually reproducing plants thrive well in stable environments. plants have different life spans, dependent on species, genotype, and environmental conditions. parts of the plant, such as regions containing meristematic tissue, continue to grow, while other parts experience programmed cell death. leaves that are no longer photosynthetically active are shed from the plant as part of senescence, and the nutrients from these leaves are recycled by the plant. other factors, including the presence of hormones, are known to play a role in delaying senescence.","[('apomixi', 'apomixes', 'apomixis'), ('natural plant reproduction', 'natural plant reproductions', 'natural plants reproduction', 'natural plants reproductions'), ('perennial', 'perennials'), ('plant reproduction', 'plant reproductions'), ('artificial plant reproduction', 'artificial plant reproductions', 'artificial plants reproduction', 'artificial plants reproductions'), ('cutting', 'cuttings'), ('plant life span', 'plant life spans', 'plant lives span', 'plant lives spans', 'plants life span', 'plants life spans', 'plants lives span', 'plants lives spans'), ('micropropagation', 'micropropagations'), ('annual', 'annuals'), ('layering', 'layerings'), ('polycarpic', 'polycarpics'), ('grafting', 'graftings'), ('asexual reproduction', 'asexual reproductions'), ('senescence', 'senescences'), ('plant death', 'plant deaths'), ('biennial', 'biennials'), ('monocarpic', 'monocarpics')]"

170,stax-bio,33,The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function,1,m44730,Animal Form and Function,"animals vary in form and function. from a sponge to a worm to a goat, an organism has a distinct body plan that limits its size and shape. animals bodies are also designed to interact with their environments, whether in the deep sea, a rainforest canopy, or the desert. therefore, a large amount of information about the structure of an organism's body (anatomy) and the function of its cells, tissues and organs (physiology) can be learned by studying that organism's environment.   animal body plans follow set patterns related to symmetry. they are asymmetrical, radial, or bilateral in form as illustrated in [link]. asymmetrical animals are animals with no pattern or symmetry; an example of an asymmetrical animal is a sponge. radial symmetry, as illustrated in [link], describes when an animal has an up-and-down orientation: any plane cut along its longitudinal axis through the organism produces equal halves, but not a definite right or left side. this plan is found mostly in aquatic animals, especially organisms that attach themselves to a base, like a rock or a boat, and extract their food from the surrounding water as it flows around the organism. bilateral symmetry is illustrated in the same figure by a goat. the goat also has an upper and lower component to it, but a plane cut from front to back separates the animal into definite right and left sides. additional terms used when describing positions in the body are anterior (front), posterior (rear), dorsal (toward the back), and ventral (toward the stomach). bilateral symmetry is found in both land-based and aquatic animals; it enables a high level of mobility. animals with bilateral symmetry that live in water tend to have a fusiform shape: this is a tubular shaped body that is tapered at both ends. this shape decreases the drag on the body as it moves through water and allows the animal to swim at high speeds. [link] lists the maximum speed of various animals. certain types of sharks can swim at fifty kilometers an hour and some dolphins at 32 to 40 kilometers per hour. land animals frequently travel faster, although the tortoise and snail are significantly slower than cheetahs. another difference in the adaptations of aquatic and land-dwelling organisms is that aquatic organisms are constrained in shape by the forces of drag in the water since water has higher viscosity than air. on the other hand, land-dwelling organisms are constrained mainly by gravity, and drag is relatively unimportant. for example, most adaptations in birds are for gravity not for drag. most animals have an exoskeleton, including insects, spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, centipedes, and crustaceans. scientists estimate that, of insects alone, there are over 30 million species on our planet. the exoskeleton is a hard covering or shell that provides benefits to the animal, such as protection against damage from predators and from water loss (for land animals); it also provides for the attachments of muscles. as the tough and resistant outer cover of an arthropod, the exoskeleton may be constructed of a tough polymer such as chitin and is often biomineralized with materials such as calcium carbonate. this is fused to the animals epidermis. ingrowths of the exoskeleton, called apodemes, function as attachment sites for muscles, similar to tendons in more advanced animals ([link]). in order to grow, the animal must first synthesize a new exoskeleton underneath the old one and then shed or molt the original covering. this limits the animals ability to grow continually, and may limit the individuals ability to mature if molting does not occur at the proper time. the thickness of the exoskeleton must be increased significantly to accommodate any increase in weight. it is estimated that a doubling of body size increases body weight by a factor of eight. the increasing thickness of the chitin necessary to support this weight limits most animals with an exoskeleton to a relatively small size. the same principles apply to endoskeletons, but they are more efficient because muscles are attached on the outside, making it easier to compensate for increased mass. an animal with an endoskeleton has its size determined by the amount of skeletal system it needs in order to support the other tissues and the amount of muscle it needs for movement. as the body size increases, both bone and muscle mass increase. the speed achievable by the animal is a balance between its overall size and the bone and muscle that provide support and movement. the exchange of nutrients and wastes between a cell and its watery environment occurs through the process of diffusion. all living cells are bathed in liquid, whether they are in a single-celled organism or a multicellular one. diffusion is effective over a specific distance and limits the size that an individual cell can attain. if a cell is a single-celled microorganism, such as an amoeba, it can satisfy all of its nutrient and waste needs through diffusion. if the cell is too large, then diffusion is ineffective and the center of the cell does not receive adequate nutrients nor is it able to effectively dispel its waste. an important concept in understanding how efficient diffusion is as a means of transport is the surface to volume ratio. recall that any three-dimensional object has a surface area and volume; the ratio of these two quantities is the surface-to-volume ratio. consider a cell shaped like a perfect sphere: it has a surface area of 4r2, and a volume of (4/3)r3. the surface-to-volume ratio of a sphere is 3/r; as the cell gets bigger, its surface to volume ratio decreases, making diffusion less efficient. the larger the size of the sphere, or animal, the less surface area for diffusion it possesses. the solution to producing larger organisms is for them to become multicellular. specialization occurs in complex organisms, allowing cells to become more efficient at doing fewer tasks. for example, circulatory systems bring nutrients and remove waste, while respiratory systems provide oxygen for the cells and remove carbon dioxide from them. other organ systems have developed further specialization of cells and tissues and efficiently control body functions. moreover, surface-to-volume ratio applies to other areas of animal development, such as the relationship between muscle mass and cross-sectional surface area in supporting skeletons, and in the relationship between muscle mass and the generation of dissipation of heat. all animals must obtain their energy from food they ingest or absorb. these nutrients are converted to adenosine triphosphate (atp) for short-term storage and use by all cells. some animals store energy for slightly longer times as glycogen, and others store energy for much longer times in the form of triglycerides housed in specialized adipose tissues. no energy system is one hundred percent efficient, and an animals metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat. if an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature, it is classified as a warm-blooded animal and called an endotherm. the insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur, fat, or feathers. the absence of insulation in ectothermic animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat. the amount of energy expended by an animal over a specific time is called its metabolic rate. the rate is measured variously in joules, calories, or kilocalories (1000 calories). carbohydrates and proteins contain about 4.5 to 5 kcal/g, and fat contains about 9 kcal/g. metabolic rate is estimated as the basal metabolic rate (bmr) in endothermic animals at rest and as the standard metabolic rate (smr) in ectotherms. human males have a bmr of 1600 to 1800 kcal/day, and human females have a bmr of 1300 to 1500 kcal/day. even with insulation, endothermal animals require extensive amounts of energy to maintain a constant body temperature. an ectotherm such as an alligator has an smr of 60 kcal/day. smaller endothermic animals have a greater surface area for their mass than larger ones ([link]). therefore, smaller animals lose heat at a faster rate than larger animals and require more energy to maintain a constant internal temperature. this results in a smaller endothermic animal having a higher bmr, per body weight, than a larger endothermic animal. the more active an animal is, the more energy is needed to maintain that activity, and the higher its bmr or smr. the average daily rate of energy consumption is about two to four times an animals bmr or smr. humans are more sedentary than most animals and have an average daily rate of only 1.5 times the bmr. the diet of an endothermic animal is determined by its bmr. for example: the type of grasses, leaves, or shrubs that an herbivore eats affects the number of calories that it takes in. the relative caloric content of herbivore foods, in descending order, is tall grasses > legumes > short grasses > forbs (any broad-leaved plant, not a grass) > subshrubs > annuals/biennials. animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor. torpor is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions. torpor can be used by animals for long periods, such as entering a state of hibernation during the winter months, in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature. during hibernation, ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0 c (32 f), while a bears internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37 c (99 f). if torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water, it is called estivation. some desert animals use this to survive the harshest months of the year. torpor can occur on a daily basis; this is seen in bats and hummingbirds. while endothermy is limited in smaller animals by surface to volume ratio, some organisms can be smaller and still be endotherms because they employ daily torpor during the part of the day that is coldest.  this allows them to conserve energy during the colder parts of the day, when they consume more energy to maintain their body temperature.  a standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes. a sagittal plane divides the body into right and left portions. a midsagittal plane divides the body exactly in the middle, making two equal right and left halves. a frontal plane (also called a coronal plane) separates the front from the back. a transverse plane (or, horizontal plane) divides the animal into upper and lower portions. this is sometimes called a cross section, and, if the transverse cut is at an angle, it is called an oblique plane. [link] illustrates these planes on a goat (a four-legged animal) and a human being. vertebrate animals have a number of defined body cavities, as illustrated in [link]. two of these are major cavities that contain smaller cavities within them. the dorsal cavity contains the cranial and the vertebral (or spinal) cavities. the ventral cavity contains the thoracic cavity, which in turn contains the pleural cavity around the lungs and the pericardial cavity, which surrounds the heart. the ventral cavity also contains the abdominopelvic cavity, which can be separated into the abdominal and the pelvic cavities. physical anthropologistphysical anthropologists study the adaption, variability, and evolution of human beings, plus their living and fossil relatives. they can work in a variety of settings, although most will have an academic appointment at a university, usually in an anthropology department or a biology, genetics, or zoology department. non-academic positions are available in the automotive and aerospace industries where the focus is on human size, shape, and anatomy. research by these professionals might range from studies of how the human body reacts to car crashes to exploring how to make seats more comfortable. other non-academic positions can be obtained in museums of natural history, anthropology, archaeology, or science and technology. these positions involve educating students from grade school through graduate school. physical anthropologists serve as education coordinators, collection managers, writers for museum publications, and as administrators. zoos employ these professionals, especially if they have an expertise in primate biology; they work in collection management and captive breeding programs for endangered species. forensic science utilizes physical anthropology expertise in identifying human and animal remains, assisting in determining the cause of death, and for expert testimony in trials. animal bodies come in a variety of sizes and shapes. limits on animal size and shape include impacts to their movement. diffusion affects their size and development. bioenergetics describes how animals use and obtain energy in relation to their body size, activity level, and environment.","[('bioenergetic', 'bioenergeticss', 'bioenergetics'), ('animal speed', 'animal speeds'), ('hibernation', 'hibernations'), ('energy requirement', 'energy requirementss', 'energy requirements'), ('midsagittal plane', 'midsagittal planes'), ('transverse plane', 'transverse planes'), ('torpor', 'torpors'), ('estivation', 'estivations'), ('bmr', 'bmrs'), ('coelom', 'coeloms'), ('coronal plane', 'coronal planes'), ('animal body function', 'animal body functions', 'animal bodies function', 'animal bodies functions', 'animals body function', 'animals body functions', 'animals bodies function', 'animals bodies functions'), ('standard metabolic rate', 'standard metabolic rates'), ('animal body', 'animal bodies'), ('basal metabolic rate', 'basal metabolic rates', 'basal metabolics rate', 'basal metabolics rates'), ('diffusion', 'diffusions'), ('ectotherm', 'ectotherms'), ('embryonic animal tissue', 'embryonic animal tissues', 'embryonic animals tissue', 'embryonic animals tissues'), ('animal form', 'animal forms'), ('body cavity', 'body cavities'), ('physical anthropologist', 'physical anthropologists'), ('horizontal plane', 'horizontal planes'), ('endoderm', 'endoderms'), ('dorsal cavity', 'dorsal cavities'), ('endotherm', 'endotherms'), ('apodeme', 'apodemess', 'apodemes'), ('animal size', 'animal sizes'), ('body plan', 'body plans'), ('asymmetry', 'asymmetries'), ('ventral cavity', 'ventral cavities'), ('body symmetry', 'body symmetries'), ('fusiform', 'fusiforms'), ('sagittal plane', 'sagittal planes'), ('animal energy', 'animal energies'), ('body plane', 'body planes'), ('smr', 'smrs'), ('mesoderm', 'mesoderms'), ('ectoderm', 'ectoderms'), ('frontal plane', 'frontal planes')]"
171,stax-bio,33,The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function,2,m44731,Animal Primary Tissues,"the tissues of multicellular, complex animals are four primary types: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. recall that tissues are groups of similar cells group of similar cells carrying out related functions. these tissues combine to form organslike the skin or kidneythat have specific, specialized functions within the body. organs are organized into organ systems to perform functions; examples include the circulatory system, which consists of the heart and blood vessels, and the digestive system, consisting of several organs, including the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas. organ systems come together to create an entire organism. epithelial tissues cover the outside of organs and structures in the body and line the lumens of organs in a single layer or multiple layers of cells. the types of epithelia are classified by the shapes of cells present and the number of layers of cells. epithelia composed of a single layer of cells is called simple epithelia; epithelial tissue composed of multiple layers is called stratified epithelia. [link] summarizes the different types of epithelial tissues. squamous epithelial cells are generally round, flat, and have a small, centrally located nucleus. the cell outline is slightly irregular, and cells fit together to form a covering or lining. when the cells are arranged in a single layer (simple epithelia), they facilitate diffusion in tissues, such as the areas of gas exchange in the lungs and the exchange of nutrients and waste at blood capillaries. [link]a illustrates a layer of squamous cells with their membranes joined together to form an epithelium. image [link]b illustrates squamous epithelial cells arranged in stratified layers, where protection is needed on the body from outside abrasion and damage. this is called a stratified squamous epithelium  and occurs in the skin and in tissues lining the mouth and vagina. cuboidal epithelial cells, shown in [link], are cube-shaped with a single, central nucleus. they are most commonly found in a single layer representing a simple epithelia in glandular tissues throughout the body where they prepare and secrete glandular material. they are also found in the walls of tubules and in the ducts of the kidney and liver. columnar epithelial cells are taller than they are wide: they resemble a stack of columns in an epithelial layer, and are most commonly found in a single-layer arrangement. the nuclei of columnar epithelial cells in the digestive tract appear to be lined up at the base of the cells, as illustrated in [link]. these cells absorb material from the lumen of the digestive tract and prepare it for entry into the body through the circulatory and lymphatic systems. columnar epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract appear to be stratified. however, each cell is attached to the base membrane of the tissue and, therefore, they are simple tissues. the nuclei are arranged at different levels in the layer of cells, making it appear as though there is more than one layer, as seen in [link]. this is called pseudostratified, columnar epithelia. this cellular covering has cilia at the apical, or free, surface of the cells. the cilia enhance the movement of mucous and trapped particles out of the respiratory tract, helping to protect the system from invasive microorganisms and harmful material that has been breathed into the body. goblet cells are interspersed in some tissues (such as the lining of the trachea). the goblet cells contain mucous that traps irritants, which in the case of the trachea keep these irritants from getting into the lungs. transitional or uroepithelial cells appear only in the urinary system, primarily in the bladder and ureter. these cells are arranged in a stratified layer, but they have the capability of appearing to pile up on top of each other in a relaxed, empty bladder, as illustrated in [link]. as the urinary bladder fills, the epithelial layer unfolds and expands to hold the volume of urine introduced into it. as the bladder fills, it expands and the lining becomes thinner. in other words, the tissue transitions from thick to thin. connective tissues are made up of a matrix consisting of living cells and a non-living substance, called the ground substance. the ground substance is made of an organic substance (usually a protein) and an inorganic substance (usually a mineral or water). the principal cell of connective tissues is the fibroblast. this cell makes the fibers found in nearly all of the connective tissues. fibroblasts are motile, able to carry out mitosis, and can synthesize whichever connective tissue is needed. macrophages, lymphocytes, and, occasionally, leukocytes can be found in some of the tissues. some tissues have specialized cells that are not found in the others. the matrix in connective tissues gives the tissue its density. when a connective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers, it has proportionally a less dense matrix. the organic portion or protein fibers found in connective tissues are either collagen, elastic, or reticular fibers. collagen fibers provide strength to the tissue, preventing it from being torn or separated from the surrounding tissues. elastic fibers are made of the protein elastin; this fiber can stretch to one and one half of its length and return to its original size and shape. elastic fibers provide flexibility to the tissues. reticular fibers are the third type of protein fiber found in connective tissues. this fiber consists of thin strands of collagen that form a network of fibers to support the tissue and other organs to which it is connected. the various types of connective tissues, the types of cells and fibers they are made of, and sample locations of the tissues is summarized in [link]. loose connective tissue, also called areolar connective tissue, has a sampling of all of the components of a connective tissue. as illustrated in [link], loose connective tissue has some fibroblasts; macrophages are present as well. collagen fibers are relatively wide and stain a light pink, while elastic fibers are thin and stain dark blue to black. the space between the formed elements of the tissue is filled with the matrix. the material in the connective tissue gives it a loose consistency similar to a cotton ball that has been pulled apart. loose connective tissue is found around every blood vessel and helps to keep the vessel in place. the tissue is also found around and between most body organs. in summary, areolar tissue is tough, yet flexible, and comprises membranes. fibrous connective tissues contain large amounts of collagen fibers and few cells or matrix material. the fibers can be arranged irregularly or regularly with the strands lined up in parallel. irregularly arranged fibrous connective tissues are found in areas of the body where stress occurs from all directions, such as the dermis of the skin. regular fibrous connective tissue, shown in [link], is found in tendons (which connect muscles to bones) and ligaments (which connect bones to bones). cartilage is a connective tissue with a large amount of the matrix and variable amounts of fibers. the cells, called chondrocytes, make the matrix and fibers of the tissue. chondrocytes are found in spaces within the tissue called lacunae. a cartilage with few collagen and elastic fibers is hyaline cartilage, illustrated in [link]. the lacunae are randomly scattered throughout the tissue and the matrix takes on a milky or scrubbed appearance with routine histological stains. sharks have cartilaginous skeletons, as does nearly the entire human skeleton during a specific pre-birth developmental stage. a remnant of this cartilage persists in the outer portion of the human nose. hyaline cartilage is also found at the ends of long bones, reducing friction and cushioning the articulations of these bones. elastic cartilage has a large amount of elastic fibers, giving it tremendous flexibility. the ears of most vertebrate animals contain this cartilage as do portions of the larynx, or voice box. fibrocartilage contains a large amount of collagen fibers, giving the tissue tremendous strength. fibrocartilage comprises the intervertebral discs in vertebrate animals. hyaline cartilage found in movable joints such as the knee and shoulder becomes damaged as a result of age or trauma. damaged hyaline cartilage is replaced by fibrocartilage and results in the joints becoming stiff. bone, or osseous tissue, is a connective tissue that has a large amount of two different types of matrix material. the organic matrix is similar to the matrix material found in other connective tissues, including some amount of collagen and elastic fibers. this gives strength and flexibility to the tissue. the inorganic matrix consists of mineral saltsmostly calcium saltsthat give the tissue hardness. without adequate organic material in the matrix, the tissue breaks; without adequate inorganic material in the matrix, the tissue bends. there are three types of cells in bone: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. osteoblasts are active in making bone for growth and remodeling. osteoblasts deposit bone material into the matrix and, after the matrix surrounds them, they continue to live, but in a reduced metabolic state as osteocytes. osteocytes are found in lacunae of the bone. osteoclasts are active in breaking down bone for bone remodeling, and they provide access to calcium stored in tissues. osteoclasts are usually found on the surface of the tissue. bone can be divided into two types: compact and spongy. compact bone is found in the shaft (or diaphysis) of a long bone and the surface of the flat bones, while spongy bone is found in the end (or epiphysis) of a long bone. compact bone is organized into subunits called osteons, as illustrated in [link]. a blood vessel and a nerve are found in the center of the structure within the haversian canal, with radiating circles of lacunae around it known as lamellae. the wavy lines seen between the lacunae are microchannels called canaliculi; they connect the lacunae to aid diffusion between the cells. spongy bone is made of tiny plates called trabeculae these plates serve as struts to give the spongy bone strength. over time, these plates can break causing the bone to become less resilient. bone tissue forms the internal skeleton of vertebrate animals, providing structure to the animal and points of attachment for tendons. adipose tissue, or fat tissue, is considered a connective tissue even though it does not have fibroblasts or a real matrix and only has a few fibers. adipose tissue is made up of cells called adipocytes that collect and store fat in the form of triglycerides, for energy metabolism. adipose tissues additionally serve as insulation to help maintain body temperatures, allowing animals to be endothermic, and they function as cushioning against damage to body organs. under a microscope, adipose tissue cells appear empty due to the extraction of fat during the processing of the material for viewing, as seen in [link]. the thin lines in the image are the cell membranes, and the nuclei are the small, black dots at the edges of the cells. blood is considered a connective tissue because it has a matrix, as shown in [link]. the living cell types are red blood cells (rbc), also called erythrocytes, and white blood cells (wbc), also called leukocytes. the fluid portion of whole blood, its matrix, is commonly called plasma. the cell found in greatest abundance in blood is the erythrocyte. erythrocytes are counted in millions in a blood sample: the average number of red blood cells in primates is 4.7 to 5.5 million cells per microliter. erythrocytes are consistently the same size in a species, but vary in size between species. for example, the average diameter of a primate red blood cell is 7.5 l, a dog is close at 7.0 l, but a cats rbc diameter is 5.9 l. sheep erythrocytes are even smaller at 4.6 l. mammalian erythrocytes lose their nuclei and mitochondria when they are released from the bone marrow where they are made. fish, amphibian, and avian red blood cells maintain their nuclei and mitochondria throughout the cells life. the principal job of an erythrocyte is to carry and deliver oxygen to the tissues. leukocytes are the predominant white blood cells found in the peripheral blood. leukocytes are counted in the thousands in the blood with measurements expressed as ranges: primate counts range from 4,800 to 10,800 cells per l, dogs from 5,600 to 19,200 cells per l, cats from 8,000 to 25,000 cells per l, cattle from 4,000 to 12,000 cells per l, and pigs from 11,000 to 22,000 cells per l. lymphocytes function primarily in the immune response to foreign antigens or material. different types of lymphocytes make antibodies tailored to the foreign antigens and control the production of those antibodies. neutrophils are phagocytic cells and they participate in one of the early lines of defense against microbial invaders, aiding in the removal of bacteria that has entered the body. another leukocyte that is found in the peripheral blood is the monocyte. monocytes give rise to phagocytic macrophages that clean up dead and damaged cells in the body, whether they are foreign or from the host animal. two additional leukocytes in the blood are eosinophils and basophilsboth help to facilitate the inflammatory response. the slightly granular material among the cells is a cytoplasmic fragment of a cell in the bone marrow. this is called a platelet or thrombocyte. platelets participate in the stages leading up to coagulation of the blood to stop bleeding through damaged blood vessels. blood has a number of functions, but primarily it transports material through the body to bring nutrients to cells and remove waste material from them. there are three types of muscle in animal bodies: smooth, skeletal, and cardiac. they differ by the presence or absence of striations or bands, the number and location of nuclei, whether they are voluntarily or involuntarily controlled, and their location within the body. [link] summarizes these differences. smooth muscle does not have striations in its cells. it has a single, centrally located nucleus, as shown in [link]. constriction of smooth muscle occurs under involuntary, autonomic nervous control and in response to local conditions in the tissues. smooth muscle tissue is also called non-striated as it lacks the banded appearance of skeletal and cardiac muscle. the walls of blood vessels, the tubes of the digestive system, and the tubes of the reproductive systems are composed of mostly smooth muscle. skeletal muscle has striations across its cells caused by the arrangement of the contractile proteins actin and myosin. these muscle cells are relatively long and have multiple nuclei along the edge of the cell. skeletal muscle is under voluntary, somatic nervous system control and is found in the muscles that move bones. [link] illustrates the histology of skeletal muscle. cardiac muscle, shown in [link], is found only in the heart. like skeletal muscle, it has cross striations in its cells, but cardiac muscle has a single, centrally located nucleus. cardiac muscle is not under voluntary control but can be influenced by the autonomic nervous system to speed up or slow down. an added feature to cardiac muscle cells is a line than extends along the end of the cell as it abuts the next cardiac cell in the row. this line is called an intercalated disc: it assists in passing electrical impulse efficiently from one cell to the next and maintains the strong connection between neighboring cardiac cells. nervous tissues are made of cells specialized to receive and transmit electrical impulses from specific areas of the body and to send them to specific locations in the body. the main cell of the nervous system is the neuron, illustrated in [link]. the large structure with a central nucleus is the cell body of the neuron. projections from the cell body are either dendrites specialized in receiving input or a single axon specialized in transmitting impulses. some glial cells are also shown. astrocytes regulate the chemical environment of the nerve cell, and oligodendrocytes insulate the axon so the electrical nerve impulse is transferred more efficiently. other glial cells that are not shown support the nutritional and waste requirements of the neuron. some of the glial cells are phagocytic and remove debris or damaged cells from the tissue. a nerve consists of neurons and glial cells. a pathologist is a medical doctor or veterinarian who has specialized in the laboratory detection of disease in animals, including humans. these professionals complete medical school education and follow it with an extensive post-graduate residency at a medical center. a pathologist may oversee clinical laboratories for the evaluation of body tissue and blood samples for the detection of disease or infection. they examine tissue specimens through a microscope to identify cancers and other diseases. some pathologists perform autopsies to determine the cause of death and the progression of disease. the basic building blocks of complex animals are four primary tissues. these are combined to form organs, which have a specific, specialized function within the body, such as the skin or kidney. organs are organized together to perform common functions in the form of systems. the four primary tissues are epithelia, connective tissues, muscle tissues, and nervous tissues.","[('chondrocyte', 'chondrocytess', 'chondrocytes'), ('nervous tissue', 'nervous tissues'), ('fibrous connective tissue', 'fibrous connective tissues'), ('squamous epithelium', 'squamous epithelias', 'squamous epithelia'), ('smooth muscle', 'smooth muscles'), ('bone', 'bones'), ('uroepithelial', 'uroepithelials'), ('loose connective tissue', 'loose connective tissues'), ('lacuna', 'lacunaes', 'lacunae'), ('matrix', 'matrices'), ('epithelial tissue', 'epithelial tissues'), ('osteon', 'osteonss', 'osteons'), ('muscle tissue', 'muscle tissues'), ('skeletal muscle', 'skeletal muscles'), ('cardiac muscle', 'cardiac muscles'), ('pathologist', 'pathologists'), ('adipose tissue', 'adipose tissues'), ('stratified epithelium', 'stratified epithelias', 'stratified epithelia'), ('columnar epithelium', 'columnar epithelias', 'columnar epithelia'), ('connective tissue', 'connective tissues'), ('transitional epithelium', 'transitional epithelias', 'transitional epithelia'), ('cartilage', 'cartilages'), ('blood', 'bloods'), ('cuboidal epithelium', 'cuboidal epithelias', 'cuboidal epithelia'), ('areolar connective tissue', 'areolar connective tissues'), ('simple epithelium', 'simple epithelias', 'simple epithelia'), ('pseudostratified', 'pseudostratifieds')]"
172,stax-bio,33,The Animal Body: Basic Form and Function,3,m44733,Homeostasis,"animal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes through a process called homeostasis (steady state). these changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external temperatures. homeostasis means to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body. it is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the bodys systems encounter. it is equilibrium because body functions are kept within specific ranges. even an animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium. the goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a set point. while there are normal fluctuations from the set point, the bodys systems will usually attempt to go back to this point. a change in the internal or external environment is called a stimulus and is detected by a receptor; the response of the system is to adjust the deviation parameter toward the set point. for instance, if the body becomes too warm, adjustments are made to cool the animal. if the bloods glucose rises after a meal, adjustments are made to lower the blood glucose level by getting the nutrient into tissues that need it or to store it for later use. when a change occurs in an animals environment, an adjustment must be made. the receptor senses the change in the environment, then sends a signal to the control center (in most cases, the brain) which in turn generates a response that is signaled to an effector. the effector is a muscle (that contracts or relaxes) or a gland that secretes. homeostatsis is maintained by negative feedback loops. positive feedback loops actually push the organism further out of homeostasis, but may be necessary for life to occur. homeostasis is controlled by the nervous and endocrine system of mammals. any homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a negative feedback loop. it may either increase or decrease the stimulus, but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it. in other words, if a level is too high, the body does something to bring it down, and conversely, if a level is too low, the body does something to make it go up. hence the term negative feedback. an example is animal maintenance of blood glucose levels. when an animal has eaten, blood glucose levels rise. this is sensed by the nervous system. specialized cells in the pancreas sense this, and the hormone insulin is released by the endocrine system. insulin causes blood glucose levels to decrease, as would be expected in a negative feedback system, as illustrated in [link]. however, if an animal has not eaten and blood glucose levels decrease, this is sensed in another group of cells in the pancreas, and the hormone glucagon is released causing glucose levels to increase. this is still a negative feedback loop, but not in the direction expected by the use of the term negative. another example of an increase as a result of the feedback loop is the control of blood calcium. if calcium levels decrease, specialized cells in the parathyroid gland sense this and release parathyroid hormone (pth), causing an increased absorption of calcium through the intestines and kidneys and, possibly, the breakdown of bone in order to liberate calcium. the effects of pth are to raise blood levels of the element. negative feedback loops are the predominant mechanism used in homeostasis. a positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus, possibly accelerating it. few examples of positive feedback loops exist in animal bodies, but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting, or coagulation. as one clotting factor is activated, it activates the next factor in sequence until a fibrin clot is achieved. the direction is maintained, not changed, so this is positive feedback. another example of positive feedback is uterine contractions during childbirth, as illustrated in [link]. the hormone oxytocin, made by the endocrine system, stimulates the contraction of the uterus. this produces pain sensed by the nervous system. instead of lowering the oxytocin and causing the pain to subside, more oxytocin is produced until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth. it is possible to adjust a systems set point. when this happens, the feedback loop works to maintain the new setting. an example of this is blood pressure: over time, the normal or set point for blood pressure can increase as a result of continued increases in blood pressure. the body no longer recognizes the elevation as abnormal and no attempt is made to return to the lower set point. the result is the maintenance of an elevated blood pressure that can have harmful effects on the body. medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level. this is called a process of alteration of the set point in a feedback loop. changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system. this is called acclimatization. this occurs, for instance, when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than it is accustomed to. in order to adjust to the lower oxygen levels at the new altitude, the body increases the number of red blood cells circulating in the blood to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues. another example of acclimatization is animals that have seasonal changes in their coats: a heavier coat in the winter ensures adequate heat retention, and a light coat in summer assists in keeping body temperature from rising to harmful levels. feedback mechanisms can be understood in terms of driving a race car along a track: watch a short video lesson on positive and negative feedback loops.

 body temperature affects body activities. generally, as body temperature rises, enzyme activity rises as well. for every ten degree centigrade rise in temperature, enzyme activity doubles, up to a point. body proteins, including enzymes, begin to denature and lose their function with high heat (around 50oc for mammals). enzyme activity will decrease by half for every ten degree centigrade drop in temperature, to the point of freezing, with a few exceptions. some fish can withstand freezing solid and return to normal with thawing. watch this discovery channel video on thermoregulation to see illustrations of this process in a variety of animals.

 animals can be divided into two groups: some maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing environmental temperatures, while others have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and thus varies with the environment. animals that do not control their body temperature are ectotherms. this group has been called cold-blooded, but the term may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body temperature. in contrast to ectotherms, which rely on external temperatures to set their body temperatures, poikilotherms are animals with constantly varying internal temperatures. an animal that maintains a constant body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called a homeotherm. endotherms are animals that rely on internal sources for body temperature but which can exhibit extremes in temperature. these animals are able to maintain a level of activity at cooler temperature, which an ectotherm cannot due to differing enzyme levels of activity. heat can be exchanged between an animal and its environment through four mechanisms: radiation, evaporation, convection, and conduction ([link]). radiation is the emission of electromagnetic heat waves. heat comes from the sun in this manner and radiates from dry skin the same way. heat can be removed with liquid from a surface during evaporation. this occurs when a mammal sweats. convection currents of air remove heat from the surface of dry skin as the air passes over it. heat will be conducted from one surface to another during direct contact with the surfaces, such as an animal resting on a warm rock. animals conserve or dissipate heat in a variety of ways. in certain climates, endothermic animals have some form of insulation, such as fur, fat, feathers, or some combination thereof. animals with thick fur or feathers create an insulating layer of air between their skin and internal organs. polar bears and seals live and swim in a subfreezing environment and yet maintain a constant, warm, body temperature. the arctic fox, for example, uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when it curls up to sleep in cold weather. mammals have a residual effect from shivering and increased muscle activity: arrector pili muscles cause goose bumps, causing small hairs to stand up when the individual is cold; this has the intended effect of increasing body temperature. mammals use layers of fat to achieve the same end. loss of significant amounts of body fat will compromise an individuals ability to conserve heat. endotherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature. vasodilation brings more blood and heat to the body surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, which helps to cool the body. vasoconstriction reduces blood flow in peripheral blood vessels, forcing blood toward the core and the vital organs found there, and conserving heat. some animals have adaptions to their circulatory system that enable them to transfer heat from arteries to veins, warming blood returning to the heart. this is called a countercurrent heat exchange; it prevents the cold venous blood from cooling the heart and other internal organs. this adaption can be shut down in some animals to prevent overheating the internal organs. the countercurrent adaption is found in many animals, including dolphins, sharks, bony fish, bees, and hummingbirds. in contrast, similar adaptations can help cool endotherms when needed, such as dolphin flukes and elephant ears. some ectothermic animals use changes in their behavior to help regulate body temperature. for example, a desert ectothermic animal may simply seek cooler areas during the hottest part of the day in the desert to keep from getting too warm. the same animals may climb onto rocks to capture heat during a cold desert night. some animals seek water to aid evaporation in cooling them, as seen with reptiles. other ectotherms use group activity such as the activity of bees to warm a hive to survive winter. many animals, especially mammals, use metabolic waste heat as a heat source. when muscles are contracted, most of the energy from the atp used in muscle actions is wasted energy that translates into heat. severe cold elicits a shivering reflex that generates heat for the body. many species also have a type of adipose tissue called brown fat that specializes in generating heat. the nervous system is important to thermoregulation, as illustrated in [link]. the processes of homeostasis and temperature control are centered in the hypothalamus of the advanced animal brain. the hypothalamus maintains the set point for body temperature through reflexes that cause
vasodilation and sweating when the body is too warm, or vasoconstriction and shivering when the body is too cold. it responds to chemicals from the body. when a bacterium is destroyed by phagocytic leukocytes, chemicals called endogenous pyrogens are released into the blood. these pyrogens circulate to the hypothalamus and reset the thermostat. this allows the bodys temperature to increase in what is commonly called a fever. an increase in body temperature causes iron to be conserved, which reduces a nutrient needed by bacteria. an increase in body heat also increases the activity of the animals enzymes and protective cells while inhibiting the enzymes and activity of the invading microorganisms. finally, heat itself may also kill the pathogen. a fever that was once thought to be a complication of an infection is now understood to be a normal defense mechanism. homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium that is maintained in body tissues and organs. it is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the systems encounter. it is in equilibrium because body functions are kept within a normal range, with some fluctuations around a set point for the processes.","[('negative feedback loop', 'negative feedback loops', 'negative feedbacks loop', 'negative feedbacks loops'), ('alteration', 'alterations'), ('acclimatization', 'acclimatizations'), ('positive feedback loop', 'positive feedback loops', 'positive feedbacks loop', 'positive feedbacks loops'), ('heat dissipation', 'heat dissipations'), ('set point', 'set points'), ('heat conservation', 'heat conservations'), ('control of homeostasi', 'control of homeostasis', 'control of homeostasis', 'controls of homeostasi', 'controls of homeostasis', 'controls of homeostasis'), ('thermoregulation', 'thermoregulations'), ('homeostatic proces', 'homeostatic processes', 'homeostatic process'), ('homeostasi', 'homeostases', 'homeostasis'), ('neural thermoregulation', 'neural thermoregulations')]"
173,stax-bio,34,Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System,0,m44734,Introduction,"all living organisms need nutrients to survive. while plants can obtain the molecules required for cellular function through the process of photosynthesis, most animals obtain their nutrients by the consumption of other organisms. at the cellular level, the biological molecules necessary for animal function are amino acids, lipid molecules, nucleotides, and simple sugars. however, the food consumed consists of protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates. animals must convert these macromolecules into the simple molecules required for maintaining cellular functions, such as assembling new molecules, cells, and tissues. the conversion of the food consumed to the nutrients required is a multi-step process involving digestion and absorption. during digestion, food particles are broken down to smaller components, and later, they are absorbed by the body. one of the challenges in human nutrition is maintaining a balance between food intake, storage, and energy expenditure. imbalances can have serious health consequences. for example, eating too much food while not expending much energy leads to obesity, which in turn will increase the risk of developing illnesses such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. the recent rise in obesity and related diseases makes understanding the role of diet and nutrition in maintaining good health all the more important.","[('fat digestion', 'fat digestions'), ('anu', 'anuss', 'anus'), ('amino acid', 'amino acids'), ('salivary amylase', 'salivary amylases'), ('liver', 'livers'), ('digestive system', 'digestive systems'), ('food requirement', 'food requirementss', 'food requirements'), ('intestinal phase', 'intestinal phases'), ('omnivore', 'omnivores'), ('lipase', 'lipases'), ('proventriculu', 'proventriculuss', 'proventriculus'), ('hormonal response', 'hormonal responses'), ('neural response', 'neural responses'), ('bolu', 'boluss', 'bolus'), ('pancrea', 'pancreass', 'pancreas'), ('large intestine', 'large intestines'), ('roughage', 'roughages'), ('duodenum', 'duodenums'), ('nutrition', 'nutritions'), ('chymotrypsin', 'chymotrypsins'), ('trypsin', 'trypsins'), ('somatostatin', 'somatostatins'), ('rectum', 'rectums'), ('gastrovascular cavity', 'gastrovascular cavities'), ('alimentary canal', 'alimentary canals'), ('bile', 'biles'), ('jejunum', 'jejunums'), ('mineral', 'minerals'), ('esophagu', 'esophaguss', 'esophagus'), ('ingestion', 'ingestions'), ('digestive proces', 'digestive processes', 'digestive process'), ('chylomicron', 'chylomicrons'), ('gastric inhibitory peptide', 'gastric inhibitory peptides', 'gastric inhibitories peptide', 'gastric inhibitories peptides'), ('carboxypeptidase', 'carboxypeptidases'), ('amylase', 'amylases'), ('small intestine', 'small intestines'), ('lactase', 'lactases'), ('sucrase', 'sucrases'), ('elimination', 'eliminations'), ('animal digestion', 'animal digestions'), ('cholecystokinin', 'cholecystokinins'), ('secretin', 'secretins'), ('carbohydrate digestion', 'carbohydrate digestions'), ('stomach', 'stomaches'), ('gallbladder', 'gallbladders'), ('digestion', 'digestions'), ('carnivore', 'carnivores'), ('maltase', 'maltases'), ('sphincter', 'sphincterss', 'sphincters'), ('digestion regulation', 'digestion regulations'), ('villi', 'villis'), ('protein digestion', 'protein digestions'), ('gastric phase', 'gastric phases'), ('essential nutrient', 'essential nutrients'), ('pseudo-ruminant', 'pseudo-ruminants'), ('ileum', 'ileums'), ('gastrin', 'gastrins'), ('ruminant', 'ruminants'), ('pepsin', 'pepsins'), ('aminopeptidase', 'aminopeptidases'), ('herbivore', 'herbivores'), ('endocrine system', 'endocrine systems'), ('food energy', 'food energies'), ('chyme', 'chymes'), ('vitamin', 'vitamins'), ('gizzard', 'gizzards'), ('cephalic phase', 'cephalic phases'), ('obesity', 'obesities'), ('pepsinogen', 'pepsinogens'), ('elastase', 'elastases'), ('monogastric', 'monogastrics'), ('avian digestion', 'avian digestions')]"
174,stax-bio,34,Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System,1,m44736,Digestive Systems,"animals obtain their nutrition from the consumption of other organisms. depending on their diet, animals can be classified into the following categories: plant eaters (herbivores), meat eaters (carnivores), and those that eat both plants and animals (omnivores). the nutrients and macromolecules present in food are not immediately accessible to the cells. there are a number of processes that modify food within the animal body in order to make the nutrients and organic molecules accessible for cellular function. as animals evolved in complexity of form and function, their digestive systems have also evolved to accommodate their various dietary needs. herbivores are animals whose primary food source is plant-based. examples of herbivores, as shown in [link] include vertebrates like deer, koalas, and some bird species, as well as invertebrates such as crickets and caterpillars. these animals have evolved digestive systems capable of handling large amounts of plant material. herbivores can be further classified into frugivores (fruit-eaters), granivores (seed eaters), nectivores (nectar feeders), and folivores (leaf eaters). carnivores are animals that eat other animals. the word carnivore is derived from latin and literally means meat eater. wild cats such as lions, shown in [link]a and tigers are examples of vertebrate carnivores, as are snakes and sharks, while invertebrate carnivores include sea stars, spiders, and ladybugs, shown in [link]b. obligate carnivores are those that rely entirely on animal flesh to obtain their nutrients; examples of obligate carnivores are members of the cat family, such as lions and cheetahs. facultative carnivores are those that also eat non-animal food in addition to animal food. note that there is no clear line that differentiates facultative carnivores from omnivores; dogs would be considered facultative carnivores. omnivores are animals that eat both plant- and animal-derived food. in latin, omnivore means to eat everything. humans, bears (shown in [link]a), and chickens are example of vertebrate omnivores; invertebrate omnivores include cockroaches and crayfish (shown in [link]b). animals have evolved different types of digestive systems to aid in the digestion of the different foods they consume. the simplest example is that of a gastrovascular cavity and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion. platyhelminthes (flatworms), ctenophora (comb jellies), and cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of digestion. gastrovascular cavities, as shown in [link]a, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the mouth, which also serves as an anus. ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity. cells within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that break down the food. the food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the gastrovascular cavity. the alimentary canal, shown in [link]b, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. once the food is ingested through the mouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard where it is churned and digested. from the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the waste is eliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus. vertebrates have evolved more complex digestive systems to adapt to their dietary needs. some animals have a single stomach, while others have multi-chambered stomachs. birds have developed a digestive system adapted to eating unmasticated food. as the word monogastric suggests, this type of digestive system consists of one (mono) stomach chamber (gastric). humans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in [link]ab. the process of digestion begins with the mouth and the intake of food. the teeth play an important role in masticating (chewing) or physically breaking down food into smaller particles. the enzymes present in saliva also begin to chemically break down food. the esophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. using peristalsis, or wave-like smooth muscle contractions, the muscles of the esophagus push the food towards the stomach. in order to speed up the actions of enzymes in the stomach, the stomach is an extremely acidic environment, with a ph between 1.5 and 2.5. the gastric juices, which include enzymes in the stomach, act on the food particles and continue the process of digestion. further breakdown of food takes place in the small intestine where enzymes produced by the liver, the small intestine, and the pancreas continue the process of digestion. the nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream across the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small intestines. the waste material travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste material is compacted into feces; it is stored until it is excreted through the rectum. birds face special challenges when it comes to obtaining nutrition from food. they do not have teeth and so their digestive system, shown in [link], must be able to process un-masticated food. birds have evolved a variety of beak types that reflect the vast variety in their diet, ranging from seeds and insects to fruits and nuts. because most birds fly, their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low. the stomach of birds has two chambers: the proventriculus, where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach, and the gizzard, where the food is stored, soaked, and mechanically ground. the undigested material forms food pellets that are sometimes regurgitated. most of the chemical digestion and absorption happens in the intestine and the waste is excreted through the cloaca. birds have a highly efficient, simplified digestive system. recent fossil evidence has shown that the evolutionary divergence of birds from other land animals was characterized by streamlining and simplifying the digestive system. unlike many other animals, birds do not have teeth to chew their food. in place of lips, they have sharp pointy beaks. the horny beak, lack of jaws, and the smaller tongue of the birds can be traced back to their dinosaur ancestors. the emergence of these changes seems to coincide with the inclusion of seeds in the bird diet. seed-eating birds have beaks that are shaped for grabbing seeds and the two-compartment stomach allows for delegation of tasks. since birds need to remain light in order to fly, their metabolic rates are very high, which means they digest their food very quickly and need to eat often. contrast this with the ruminants, where the digestion of plant matter takes a very long time. ruminants are mainly herbivores like cows, sheep, and goats, whose entire diet consists of eating large amounts of roughage or fiber. they have evolved digestive systems that help them digest vast amounts of cellulose. an interesting feature of the ruminants mouth is that they do not have upper incisor teeth. they use their lower teeth, tongue and lips to tear and chew their food. from the mouth, the food travels to the esophagus and on to the stomach. to help digest the large amount of plant material, the stomach of the ruminants is a multi-chambered organ, as illustrated in [link]. the four compartments of the stomach are called the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. these chambers contain many microbes that break down cellulose and ferment ingested food. the abomasum is the true stomach and is the equivalent of the monogastric stomach chamber where gastric juices are secreted. the four-compartment gastric chamber provides larger space and the microbial support necessary to digest plant material in ruminants. the fermentation process produces large amounts of gas in the stomach chamber, which must be eliminated. as in other animals, the small intestine plays an important role in nutrient absorption, and the large intestine helps in the elimination of waste. some animals, such as camels and alpacas, are pseudo-ruminants. they eat a lot of plant material and roughage. digesting plant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose. the digestive enzymes of these animals cannot break down cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can. therefore, the digestive system must be able to handle large amounts of roughage and break down the cellulose. pseudo-ruminants have a three-chamber stomach in the digestive system. however, their cecuma pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine containing many microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materialsis large and is the site where the roughage is fermented and digested. these animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum, abomasum, and reticulum. the vertebrate digestive system is designed to facilitate the transformation of food matter into the nutrient components that sustain organisms. the oral cavity, or mouth, is the point of entry of food into the digestive system, illustrated in [link]. the food consumed is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. all mammals have teeth and can chew their food. the extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth. as food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary glands, mixes with the food. saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals. there are three major glands that secrete salivathe parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the ph of the food. saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes, which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria. saliva also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose. another enzyme called lipase is produced by the cells in the tongue. lipases are a class of enzymes that can break down triglycerides. the lingual lipase begins the breakdown of fat components in the food. the chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the bolus for swallowing. the tongue helps in swallowingmoving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx. the pharynx opens to two passageways: the trachea, which leads to the lungs, and the esophagus, which leads to the stomach. the trachea has an opening called the glottis, which is covered by a cartilaginous flap called the epiglottis. when swallowing, the epiglottis closes the glottis and food passes into the esophagus and not the trachea. this arrangement allows food to be kept out of the trachea. the esophagus is a tubular organ that connects the mouth to the stomach. the chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed. the smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo a series of wave like movements called peristalsis that push the food toward the stomach, as illustrated in [link]. the peristalsis wave is unidirectionalit moves food from the mouth to the stomach, and reverse movement is not possible. the peristaltic movement of the esophagus is an involuntary reflex; it takes place in response to the act of swallowing. a ring-like muscle called a sphincter forms valves in the digestive system. the gastro-esophageal sphincter is located at the stomach end of the esophagus. in response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens, and the bolus enters the stomach. when there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the stomach from traveling up the esophagus. many animals have a true sphincter; however, in humans, there is no true sphincter, but the esophagus remains closed when there is no swallowing action. acid reflux or heartburn occurs when the acidic digestive juices escape into the esophagus. a large part of digestion occurs in the stomach, shown in [link]. the stomach is a saclike organ that secretes gastric digestive juices. the ph in the stomach is between 1.5 and 2.5. this highly acidic environment is required for the chemical breakdown of food and the extraction of nutrients. when empty, the stomach is a rather small organ; however, it can expand to up to 20 times its resting size when filled with food. this characteristic is particularly useful for animals that need to eat when food is available. the stomach is also the major site for protein digestion in animals other than ruminants. protein digestion is mediated by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber. pepsin is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called pepsinogen. pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides; it also helps activate more pepsinogen, starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin. another cell typeparietal cellssecrete hydrogen and chloride ions, which combine in the lumen to form hydrochloric acid, the primary acidic component of the stomach juices. hydrochloric acid helps to convert the inactive pepsinogen to pepsin. the highly acidic environment also kills many microorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin, results in the hydrolysis of protein in the food. chemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach. contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes. the partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called chyme. chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine. further protein digestion takes place in the small intestine. gastric emptying occurs within two to six hours after a meal. only a small amount of chyme is released into the small intestine at a time. the movement of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine is regulated by the pyloric sphincter. when digesting protein and some fats, the stomach lining must be protected from getting digested by pepsin. there are two points to consider when describing how the stomach lining is protected. first, as previously mentioned, the enzyme pepsin is synthesized in the inactive form. this protects the chief cells, because pepsinogen does not have the same enzyme functionality of pepsin. second, the stomach has a thick mucus lining that protects the underlying tissue from the action of the digestive juices. when this mucus lining is ruptured, ulcers can form in the stomach. ulcers are open wounds in or on an organ caused by bacteria (helicobacter pylori) when the mucus lining is ruptured and fails to reform. chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. the small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein, fats, and carbohydrates is completed. the small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger-like projections called the villi. the apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli. these structures, illustrated in [link], are lined with epithelial cells on the luminal side and allow for the nutrients to be absorbed from the digested food and absorbed into the blood stream on the other side. the villi and microvilli, with their many folds, increase the surface area of the intestine and increase absorption efficiency of the nutrients. absorbed nutrients in the blood are carried into the hepatic portal vein, which leads to the liver. there, the liver regulates the distribution of nutrients to the rest of the body and removes toxic substances, including drugs, alcohol, and some pathogens. the human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. the c-shaped, fixed part of the small intestine is called the duodenum and is shown in [link]. the duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum. in the duodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer. pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum. bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. these digestive juices break down the food particles in the chyme into glucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum. absorption of fatty acids also takes place in the duodenum. the second part of the small intestine is called the jejunum, shown in [link]. here, hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining. the bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum. the ileum, also illustrated in [link] is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed into blood stream. the undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle. the ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. the vermiform, worm-like, appendix is located at the ileocecal valve. the appendix of humans secretes no enzymes and has an insignificant role in immunity. the large intestine, illustrated in [link], reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste material. the human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter. it has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. the cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the waste matter. the colon is home to many bacteria or intestinal flora that aid in the digestive processes. the colon can be divided into four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. the main functions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material. carnivorous mammals have a shorter large intestine compared to herbivorous mammals due to their diet. the rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine, as shown in [link]. the primary role of the rectum is to store the feces until defecation. the feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination. the anus is an opening at the far-end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material. two sphincters between the rectum and anus control elimination: the inner sphincter is involuntary and the outer sphincter is voluntary. the organs discussed above are the organs of the digestive tract through which food passes. accessory organs are organs that add secretions (enzymes) that catabolize food into nutrients. accessory organs include salivary glands, the liver, the pancreas, and the gallbladder. the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are regulated by hormones in response to the food consumed. the liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying blood. the liver produces bile, a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fatty components of the food in the duodenum. the liver also processes the vitamins and fats and synthesizes many plasma proteins. the pancreas is another important gland that secretes digestive juices. the chyme produced from the stomach is highly acidic in nature; the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate, an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme. additionally, the pancreatic juices contain a large variety of enzymes that are required for the digestion of protein and carbohydrates. the gallbladder is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts. when chyme containing fatty acids enters the duodenum, the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum. different animals have evolved different types of digestive systems specialized to meet their dietary needs. humans and many other animals have monogastric digestive systems with a single-chambered stomach. birds have evolved a digestive system that includes a gizzard where the food is crushed into smaller pieces. this compensates for their inability to masticate. ruminants that consume large amounts of plant material have a multi-chambered stomach that digests roughage. pseudo-ruminants have similar digestive processes as ruminants but do not have the four-compartment stomach. processing food involves ingestion (eating), digestion (mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of large molecules), absorption (cellular uptake of nutrients), and elimination (removal of undigested waste as feces). many organs work together to digest food and absorb nutrients. the mouth is the point of ingestion and the location where both mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. saliva contains an enzyme called amylase that breaks down carbohydrates. the food bolus travels through the esophagus by peristaltic movements to the stomach. the stomach has an extremely acidic environment. an enzyme called pepsin digests protein in the stomach. further digestion and absorption take place in the small intestine. the large intestine reabsorbs water from the undigested food and stores waste until elimination.","[('peristalsi', 'peristalses', 'peristalsis'), ('anu', 'anuss', 'anus'), ('amylase',

175,stax-bio,34,Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System,2,m44740,Nutrition and Energy Production,"given the diversity of animal life on our planet, it is not surprising that the animal diet would also vary substantially. the animal diet is the source of materials needed for building dna and other complex molecules needed for growth, maintenance, and reproduction; collectively these processes are called biosynthesis. the diet is also the source of materials for atp production in the cells. the diet must be balanced to provide the minerals and vitamins that are required for cellular function. what are the fundamental requirements of the animal diet? the animal diet should be well balanced and provide nutrients required for bodily function and the minerals and vitamins required for maintaining structure and regulation necessary for good health and reproductive capability. these requirements for a human are illustrated graphically in [link] obesity is a growing epidemic and the rate of obesity among children is rapidly rising in the united states. to combat childhood obesity and ensure that children get a healthy start in life, first lady michelle obama has launched the lets move! campaign. the goal of this campaign is to educate parents and caregivers on providing healthy nutrition and encouraging active lifestyles to future generations. this program aims to involve the entire community, including parents, teachers, and healthcare providers to ensure that children have access to healthy foodsmore fruits, vegetables, and whole grainsand consume fewer calories from processed foods. another goal is to ensure that children get physical activity. with the increase in television viewing and stationary pursuits such as video games, sedentary lifestyles have become the norm. learn more at www.letsmove.gov. the organic molecules required for building cellular material and tissues must come from food. carbohydrates or sugars are the primary source of organic carbons in the animal body. during digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately broken down into glucose and used to provide energy through metabolic pathways. complex carbohydrates, including polysaccharides, can be broken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce the enzyme cellulase and lack the ability to derive glucose from the polysaccharide cellulose. in humans, these molecules provide the fiber required for moving waste through the large intestine and a healthy colon. the intestinal flora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition from these plant fibers. the excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles for later use. glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance running, and to provide energy during food shortage. excess glycogen can be converted to fats, which are stored in the lower layer of the skin of mammals for insulation and energy storage. excess digestible carbohydrates are stored by mammals in order to survive famine and aid in mobility. another important requirement is that of nitrogen. protein catabolism provides a source of organic nitrogen. amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and protein breakdown provides amino acids that are used for cellular function. the carbon and nitrogen derived from these become the building block for nucleotides, nucleic acids, proteins, cells, and tissues. excess nitrogen must be excreted as it is toxic. fats add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness. fatty foods are also significant sources of energy because one gram of fat contains nine calories. fats are required in the diet to aid the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones. while the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from the organic precursors, there are some nutrients that need to be consumed from food. these nutrients are termed essential nutrients, meaning they must be eaten, and the body cannot produce them. the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and the omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane phospholipids. vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities for many enzymes to function and, for this reason, are considered to be co-enzymes. absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health, as outlined in [link] and [link]. both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins must be obtained from food. minerals, listed in [link], are inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food. among their many functions, minerals help in structure and regulation and are considered co-factors. certain amino acids also must be procured from food and cannot be synthesized by the body. these amino acids are the essential amino acids. the human body can synthesize only 11 of the 20 required amino acids; the rest must be obtained from food. the essential amino acids are listed in [link]. animals need food to obtain energy and maintain homeostasis. homeostasis is the ability of a system to maintain a stable internal environment even in the face of external changes to the environment. for example, the normal body temperature of humans is 37c (98.6f). humans maintain this temperature even when the external temperature is hot or cold. it takes energy to maintain this body temperature, and animals obtain this energy from food. the primary source of energy for animals is carbohydrates, mainly glucose. glucose is called the bodys fuel. the digestible carbohydrates in an animals diet are converted to glucose molecules through a series of catabolic chemical reactions. adenosine triphosphate, or atp, is the primary energy currency in cells; atp stores energy in phosphate ester bonds. atp releases energy when the phosphodiester bonds are broken and atp is converted to adp and a phosphate group. atp is produced by the oxidative reactions in the cytoplasm and mitochondrion of the cell, where carbohydrates, proteins, and fats undergo a series of metabolic reactions collectively called cellular respiration. for example, glycolysis is a series of reactions in which glucose is converted to pyruvic acid and some of its chemical potential energy is transferred to nadh and atp. atp is required for all cellular functions. it is used to build the organic molecules that are required for cells and tissues; it provides energy for muscle contraction and for the transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system. when the amount of atp is available in excess of the bodys requirements, the liver uses the excess atp and excess glucose to produce molecules called glycogen. glycogen is a polymeric form of glucose and is stored in the liver and skeletal muscle cells. when blood sugar drops, the liver releases glucose from stores of glycogen. skeletal muscle converts glycogen to glucose during intense exercise. the process of converting glucose and excess atp to glycogen and the storage of excess energy is an evolutionarily important step in helping animals deal with mobility, food shortages, and famine. obesityobesity is a major health concern in the united states, and there is a growing focus on reducing obesity and the diseases it may lead to, such as type-2 diabetes, cancers of the colon and breast, and cardiovascular disease. how does the food consumed contribute to obesity? fatty foods are calorie-dense, meaning that they have more calories per unit mass than carbohydrates or proteins. one gram of carbohydrates has four calories, one gram of protein has four calories, and one gram of fat has nine calories. animals tend to seek lipid-rich food for their higher energy content. the signals of hunger (time to eat) and satiety (time to stop eating) are controlled in the hypothalamus region of the brain. foods that are rich in fatty acids tend to promote satiety more than foods that are rich only in carbohydrates. excess carbohydrate and atp are used by the liver to synthesize glycogen. the pyruvate produced during glycolysis is used to synthesize fatty acids. when there is more glucose in the body than required, the resulting excess pyruvate is converted into molecules that eventually result in the synthesis of fatty acids within the body. these fatty acids are stored in adipose cellsthe fat cells in the mammalian body whose primary role is to store fat for later use. it is important to note that some animals benefit from obesity. polar bears and seals need body fat for insulation and to keep them from losing body heat during arctic winters. when food is scarce, stored body fat provides energy for maintaining homeostasis. fats prevent famine in mammals, allowing them to access energy when food is not available on a daily basis; fats are stored when a large kill is made or lots of food is available. animal diet should be balanced and meet the needs of the body. carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the primary components of food. some essential nutrients are required for cellular function but cannot be produced by the animal body. these include vitamins, minerals, some fatty acids, and some amino acids. food intake in more than necessary amounts is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells, and in fat cells. excess adipose storage can lead to obesity and serious health problems. atp is the energy currency of the cell and is obtained from the metabolic pathways. excess carbohydrates and energy are stored as glycogen in the body.","[('essential nutrient', 'essential nutrients'), ('digestive system', 'digestive systems'), ('food requirement', 'food requirementss', 'food requirements'), ('animal digestion', 'animal digestions'), ('food energy', 'food energies'), ('vitamin', 'vitamins'), ('obesity', 'obesities'), ('mineral', 'minerals'), ('nutrition', 'nutritions'), ('amino acid', 'amino acids')]"
176,stax-bio,34,Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System,3,m44742,Digestive System Processes,"obtaining nutrition and energy from food is a multi-step process. for true animals, the first step is ingestion, the act of taking in food. this is followed by digestion, absorption, and elimination. in the following sections, each of these steps will be discussed in detail. the large molecules found in intact food cannot pass through the cell membranes. food needs to be broken into smaller particles so that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules. the first step in this process is ingestion. ingestion is the process of taking in food through the mouth. in vertebrates, the teeth, saliva, and tongue play important roles in mastication (preparing the food into bolus). while the food is being mechanically broken down, the enzymes in saliva begin to chemically process the food as well. the combined action of these processes modifies the food from large particles to a soft mass that can be swallowed and can travel the length of the esophagus. digestion is the mechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments. it is important to break down macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium. large, complex molecules of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids must be reduced to simpler particles such as simple sugar before they can be absorbed by the digestive epithelial cells. different organs play specific roles in the digestive process. the animal diet needs carbohydrates, protein, and fat, as well as vitamins and inorganic components for nutritional balance. how each of these components is digested is discussed in the following sections. the digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. the salivary enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of food starches into maltose, a disaccharide. as the bolus of food travels through the esophagus to the stomach, no significant digestion of carbohydrates takes place. the esophagus produces no digestive enzymes but does produce mucous for lubrication. the acidic environment in the stomach stops the action of the amylase enzyme. the next step of carbohydrate digestion takes place in the duodenum. recall that the chyme from the stomach enters the duodenum and mixes with the digestive secretion from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. pancreatic juices also contain amylase, which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose, a disaccharide. the disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called maltases, sucrases, and lactases, which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall. maltase breaks down maltose into glucose. other disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose are broken down by sucrase and lactase, respectively. sucrase breaks down sucrose (or table sugar) into glucose and fructose, and lactase breaks down lactose (or milk sugar) into glucose and galactose. the monosaccharides (glucose) thus produced are absorbed and then can be used in metabolic pathways to harness energy. the monosaccharides are transported across the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream to be transported to the different cells in the body. the steps in carbohydrate digestion are summarized in [link] and [link]. a large part of protein digestion takes place in the stomach. the enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the digestion of proteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides, which are short chains of four to nine amino acids. in the duodenum, other enzymestrypsin, elastase, and chymotrypsinact on the peptides reducing them to smaller peptides. trypsin elastase, carboxypeptidase, and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where they act on the chyme. further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases (those that break down peptides). specifically, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, and aminopeptidase play important roles in reducing the peptides to free amino acids. the amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestines. the steps in protein digestion are summarized in [link] and [link]. lipid digestion begins in the stomach with the aid of lingual lipase and gastric lipase. however, the bulk of lipid digestion occurs in the small intestine due to pancreatic lipase. when chyme enters the duodenum, the hormonal responses trigger the release of bile, which is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. bile aids in the digestion of lipids, primarily triglycerides by emulsification. emulsification is a process in which large lipid globules are broken down into several small lipid globules. these small globules are more widely distributed in the chyme rather than forming large aggregates. lipids are hydrophobic substances: in the presence of water, they will aggregate to form globules to minimize exposure to water. bile contains bile salts, which are amphipathic, meaning they contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. thus, the bile salts hydrophilic side can interface with water on one side and the hydrophobic side interfaces with lipids on the other. by doing so, bile salts emulsify large lipid globules into small lipid globules. why is emulsification important for digestion of lipids? pancreatic juices contain enzymes called lipases (enzymes that break down lipids). if the lipid in the chyme aggregates into large globules, very little surface area of the lipids is available for the lipases to act on, leaving lipid digestion incomplete. by forming an emulsion, bile salts increase the available surface area of the lipids many fold. the pancreatic lipases can then act on the lipids more efficiently and digest them, as detailed in [link]. lipases break down the lipids into fatty acids and glycerides. these molecules can pass through the plasma membrane of the cell and enter the epithelial cells of the intestinal lining. the bile salts surround long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides forming tiny spheres called micelles. the micelles move into the brush border of the small intestine absorptive cells where the long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse out of the micelles into the absorptive cells leaving the micelles behind in the chyme. the long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides, which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins. these large spheres are called chylomicrons. chylomicrons contain triglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids and have proteins on their surface. the surface is also composed of the hydrophilic phosphate ""heads"" of phospholipids. together, they enable the chylomicron to move in an aqueous environment without exposing the lipids to water. chylomicrons leave the absorptive cells via exocytosis. chylomicrons enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the blood in the subclavian vein. vitamins can be either water-soluble or lipid-soluble. fat soluble vitamins are absorbed in the same manner as lipids. it is important to consume some amount of dietary lipid to aid the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins. water-soluble vitamins can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream from the intestine. the final step in digestion is the elimination of undigested food content and waste products. the undigested food material enters the colon, where most of the water is reabsorbed. recall that the colon is also home to the microflora called intestinal flora that aid in the digestion process. the semi-solid waste is moved through the colon by peristaltic movements of the muscle and is stored in the rectum. as the rectum expands in response to storage of fecal matter, it triggers the neural signals required to set up the urge to eliminate. the solid waste is eliminated through the anus using peristaltic movements of the rectum. diarrhea and constipation are some of the most common health concerns that affect digestion. constipation is a condition where the feces are hardened because of excess water removal in the colon. in contrast, if enough water is not removed from the feces, it results in diarrhea. many bacteria, including the ones that cause cholera, affect the proteins involved in water reabsorption in the colon and result in excessive diarrhea. emesis, or vomiting, is elimination of food by forceful expulsion through the mouth. it is often in response to an irritant that affects the digestive tract, including but not limited to viruses, bacteria, emotions, sights, and food poisoning. this forceful expulsion of the food is due to the strong contractions produced by the stomach muscles. the process of emesis is regulated by the medulla. digestion begins with ingestion, where the food is taken in the mouth. digestion and absorption take place in a series of steps with special enzymes playing important roles in digesting carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. elimination describes removal of undigested food contents and waste products from the body. while most absorption occurs in the small intestines, the large intestine is responsible for the final removal of water that remains after the absorptive process of the small intestines. the cells that line the large intestine absorb some vitamins as well as any leftover salts and water. the large intestine (colon) is also where feces is formed.","[('fat digestion', 'fat digestions'), ('animal digestion', 'animal digestions'),

177,stax-bio,34,Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System,4,m44744,Digestive System Regulation,"the brain is the control center for the sensation of hunger and satiety. the functions of the digestive system are regulated through neural and hormonal responses. in reaction to the smell, sight, or thought of food, like that shown in [link], the first response is that of salivation. the salivary glands secrete more saliva in response to stimulation by the autonomic nervous system triggered by food in preparation for digestion. simultaneously, the stomach begins to produce hydrochloric acid to digest the food. recall that the peristaltic movements of the esophagus and other organs of the digestive tract are under the control of the brain. the brain prepares these muscles for movement as well. when the stomach is full, the part of the brain that detects satiety signals fullness. there are three overlapping phases of gastric controlthe cephalic phase, the gastric phase, and the intestinal phaseeach requires many enzymes and is under neural control as well. the response to food begins even before food enters the mouth. the first phase of ingestion, called the cephalic phase, is controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food. all aspectssuch as sight, sense, and smelltrigger the neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices. the gastric and salivary secretion in the cephalic phase can also take place due to the thought of food. right now, if you think about a piece of chocolate or a crispy potato chip, the increase in salivation is a cephalic phase response to the thought. the central nervous system prepares the stomach to receive food. the gastric phase begins once the food arrives in the stomach. it builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase. gastric acids and enzymes process the ingested materials. the gastric phase is stimulated by (1) distension of the stomach, (2) a decrease in the ph of the gastric contents, and (3) the presence of undigested material. this phase consists of local, hormonal, and neural responses. these responses stimulate secretions and powerful contractions. the intestinal phase begins when chyme enters the small intestine triggering digestive secretions. this phase controls the rate of gastric emptying. in addition to gastrin emptying, when chyme enters the small intestine, it triggers other hormonal and neural events that coordinate the activities of the intestinal tract, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. the endocrine system controls the response of the various glands in the body and the release of hormones at the appropriate times. one of the important factors under hormonal control is the stomach acid environment. during the gastric phase, the hormone gastrin is secreted by g cells in the stomach in response to the presence of proteins. gastrin stimulates the release of stomach acid, or hydrochloric acid (hcl) which aids in the digestion of the proteins. however, when the stomach is emptied, the acidic environment need not be maintained and a hormone called somatostatin stops the release of hydrochloric acid. this is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism. in the duodenum, digestive secretions from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder play an important role in digesting chyme during the intestinal phase. in order to neutralize the acidic chyme, a hormone called secretin stimulates the pancreas to produce alkaline bicarbonate solution and deliver it to the duodenum. secretin acts in tandem with another hormone called cholecystokinin (cck). not only does cck stimulate the pancreas to produce the requisite pancreatic juices, it also stimulates the gallbladder to release bile into the duodenum. another level of hormonal control occurs in response to the composition of food. foods high in lipids take a long time to digest. a hormone called gastric inhibitory peptide is secreted by the small intestine to slow down the peristaltic movements of the intestine to allow fatty foods more time to be digested and absorbed. understanding the hormonal control of the digestive system is an important area of ongoing research. scientists are exploring the role of each hormone in the digestive process and developing ways to target these hormones. advances could lead to knowledge that may help to battle the obesity epidemic. the brain and the endocrine system control digestive processes. the brain controls the responses of hunger and satiety. the endocrine system controls the release of hormones and enzymes required for digestion of food in the digestive tract.","[('intestinal phase', 'intestinal phases'), ('animal digestion', 'animal digestions'), ('gastric inhibitory peptide', 'gastric

179,stax-bio,35,The Nervous System,1,m44747,Neruons and Gilial Cells,"nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom vary in structure and complexity, as illustrated by the variety of animals shown in [link]. some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a nerve net. echinoderms such as sea stars have nerve cells that are bundled into fibers called nerves. flatworms of the phylum platyhelminthes have both a central nervous system (cns), made up of a small brain and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (pns) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body. the insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized. it contains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia (clusters of connected neurons). these ganglia can control movements and behaviors without input from the brain. octopi may have the most complicated of invertebrate nervous systemsthey have neurons that are organized in specialized lobes and eyes that are structurally similar to vertebrate species. compared to invertebrates, vertebrate nervous systems are more complex, centralized, and specialized. while there is great diversity among different vertebrate nervous systems, they all share a basic structure: a cns that contains a brain and spinal cord and a pns made up of peripheral sensory and motor nerves. one interesting difference between the nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates is that the nerve cords of many invertebrates are located ventrally whereas the vertebrate spinal cords are located dorsally. there is debate among evolutionary biologists as to whether these different nervous system plans evolved separately or whether the invertebrate body plan arrangement somehow flipped during the evolution of vertebrates. watch this video of  biologist mark kirschner discussing the flipping phenomenon of vertebrate evolution.

 the nervous system is made up of neurons, specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals, and glia, cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to neurons. a neuron can be compared to an electrical wireit transmits a signal from one place to another. glia can be compared to the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to the right places, maintain the wires, and take down wires that are broken. although glia have been compared to workers, recent evidence suggests that also usurp some of the signaling functions of neurons. there is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in different parts of the nervous system. there are four major types of neurons, and they share several important cellular components. the nervous system of the common laboratory fly, drosophila melanogaster, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same number as a lobster. this number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus. a human brain contains around 86 billion neurons. despite these very different numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same behaviorsfrom basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like finding food and courting mates. the ability of neurons to communicate with each other as well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors. most neurons share the same cellular components. but neurons are also highly specializeddifferent types of neurons have different sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles. like other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that contains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components. neurons also contain unique structures, illustrated in [link] for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible. dendrites are tree-like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses. although some neurons do not have any dendrites, some types of neurons have multiple dendrites. dendrites can have small protrusions called dendritic spines, which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections. once a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body. the cell body contains a specialized structure, the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an axon. an axon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals. these terminals in turn synapse on other neurons, muscle, or target organs. chemicals released at axon terminals allow signals to be communicated to these other cells. neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like amacrine cells in the retina, do not contain any axons. some axons are covered with myelin, which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed on conduction. this insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meterfrom the base of the spine to the toes. the myelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron. myelin is produced by glial cells. along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath. these gaps are called nodes of ranvier and are sites where the signal is recharged as it travels along the axon. it is important to note that a single neuron does not act aloneneuronal communication depends on the connections that neurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells). dendrites from a single neuron may receive synaptic contact from many other neurons. for example, dendrites from a purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive contact from as many as 200,000 other neurons. there are different types of neurons, and the functional role of a given neuron is intimately dependent on its structure. there is an amazing diversity of neuron shapes and sizes found in different parts of the nervous system (and across species), as illustrated by the neurons shown in [link]. while there are many defined neuron cell subtypes, neurons are broadly divided into four basic types: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar. [link] illustrates these four basic neuron types. unipolar neurons have only one structure that extends away from the soma. these neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands. a bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. an example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). an example of a multipolar neuron is a purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but only one axon. pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells. a pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a bipolar cell. most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions: one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord. neurogenesis
at one time, scientists believed that people were born with all the neurons they would ever have. research performed during the last few decades indicates that neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, continues into adulthood. neurogenesis was first discovered in songbirds that produce new neurons while learning songs. for mammals, new neurons also play an important role in learning: about 1000 new neurons develop in the hippocampus (a brain structure involved in learning and memory) each day. while most of the new neurons will die, researchers found that an increase in the number of surviving new neurons in the hippocampus correlated with how well rats learned a new task. interestingly, both exercise and some antidepressant medications also promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus. stress has the opposite effect. while neurogenesis is quite limited compared to regeneration in other tissues, research in this area may lead to new treatments for disorders such as alzheimers, stroke, and epilepsy. how do scientists identify new neurons? a researcher can inject a compound called bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) into the brain of an animal. while all cells will be exposed to brdu, brdu will only be incorporated into the dna of newly generated cells that are in s phase. a technique called immunohistochemistry can be used to attach a fluorescent label to the incorporated brdu, and a researcher can use fluorescent microscopy to visualize the presence of brdu, and thus new neurons, in brain tissue. [link] is a micrograph which shows fluorescently labeled neurons in the hippocampus of a rat. while glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the nervous system, the number of glial cells in the brain actually outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten. neurons would be unable to function without the vital roles that are fulfilled by these glial cells. glia guide developing neurons to their destinations, buffer ions and chemicals that would otherwise harm neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons. scientists have recently discovered that they also play a role in responding to nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells. when glia do not function properly, the result can be disastrousmost brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia. there are several different types of glia with different functions, two of which are shown in [link]. astrocytes, shown in [link]a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the cns. they provide nutrients and other substances to neurons, regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid, and provide structural support for synapses. astrocytes also form the blood-brain barriera structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain. astrocytes, in particular, have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity, transmit calcium waves between astrocytes, and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses. satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the pns. microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms. oligodendrocytes, shown in [link]b form myelin sheaths around axons in the cns. one axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes, and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons. this is distinctive from the pns where a single schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire schwann cell surrounds the axon. radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations. ependymal cells line fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. they are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid, which serves as a cushion for the brain, moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain, and is a component for the choroid plexus. the nervous system is made up of neurons and glia. neurons are specialized cells that are capable of sending electrical as well as chemical signals. most neurons contain dendrites, which receive these signals, and axons that send signals to other neurons or tissues. there are four main types of neurons: unipolar, bipolar, multipolar, and pseudounipolar neurons. glia are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that support neuronal development and signaling. there are several types of glia that serve different functions.","[('node of ranvier', 'node of ranvier', 'nodes of ranvier', 'nodes of ranvier'), ('glium function', 'glium functions'), ('microglium', 'microglias', 'microglia'), ('schwann cell', 'schwann cells'), ('glium', 'glias', 'glia'), ('synapse', 'synapses'), ('myelin', 'myelins'), ('glial cell', 'glial cells'), ('neurogenesi', 'neurogeneses', 'neurogenesis'), ('neuron', 'neurons'), ('neuron structure', 'neuron structures'), ('dendrite', 'dendrites'), ('satellite glium', 'satellite glias', 'satellite glia'), ('neuron type', 'neuron types'), ('nervous system', 'nervous systems'), ('glium type', 'glium typess', 'glium types'), ('axon terminal', 'axon terminals'), ('ependymal', 'ependymals'), ('neuron part', 'neuron partss', 'neuron parts'), ('axon', 'axons'), ('oligodendrocyte', 'oligodendrocytes'), ('axon hillock', 'axon hillocks'), ('astrocyte', 'astrocytes'), ('radial glium', 'radial glias', 'radial glia')]"
180,stax-bio,35,The Nervous System,2,m44748,How Neurons Communicate,"all functions performed by the nervous systemfrom a simple motor reflex to more advanced functions like making a memory or a decisionrequire neurons to communicate with one another. while humans use words and body language to communicate, neurons use electrical and chemical signals. just like a person in a committee, one neuron usually receives and synthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before making the decision to send the message on to other neurons. for the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. these signals are possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. to understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or resting membrane charge. the lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. to enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. ion channels have different configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in [link]. some ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. these ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. the difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential. this video discusses the basis of the resting membrane potential.

 a neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside (70 mv, note that this number varies by neuron type and by species). this voltage is called the resting membrane potential; it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. if the membrane were equally permeable to all ions, each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium. because ions cannot simply cross the membrane at will, there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown in [link]. the difference in the number of positively charged potassium ions (k+) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane potential ([link]). when the membrane is at rest, k+ ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with the concentration gradient. the negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of cations outside the cell (in the extracellular fluid) relative to inside the cell (in the cytoplasm). the negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement. in neurons, potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell. the cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient. however, the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels. therefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in. because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering, this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell. the actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential, once established. recall that  sodium potassium pumps brings two k+ ions into the cell while removing three na+ ions per atp consumed. as more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in, the inside of the cell remains negatively charged relative to the extracellular fluid. it should be noted that chloride ions (cl) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm. a neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input is strong enough, send the signal to downstream neurons. transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter. transmission of a signal within a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential. when neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neurons dendrites, ion channels open. at excitatory synapses, this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membranea decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron. a stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to  its threshold potential (-55 mv). na+ channels in the axon hillock open, allowing positive ions to enter the cell ([link] and [link]). once the sodium channels open, the neuron completely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about +40 mv.  action potentials are considered an ""all-or nothing"" event, in that, once the threshold potential is reached, the neuron always completely depolarizes. once depolarization is complete, the cell must now ""reset"" its membrane voltage back to the resting potential. to accomplish this, the na+ channels close and cannot be opened. this begins the neuron's refractory period, in which it cannot produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open. at the same time, voltage-gated k+ channels open, allowing k+ to leave the cell. as k+ ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again becomes negative. the diffusion of k+ out of the cell actually hyperpolarizes the cell, in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell's normal resting potential. at this point, the sodium channels will return to their resting state, meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again  exceeds the threshold potential. eventually the extra k+ ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels, bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state, back to its resting membrane potential. 
 for an action potential to communicate information to another neuron, it must travel along the axon and reach the axon terminals where it can initiate neurotransmitter release. the speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is influenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axons resistance to current leak. myelin acts as an insulator that prevents current from leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential conduction. in demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas. the nodes of ranvier, illustrated in [link] are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon. these unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer long and contain voltage gated na+ and k+ channels. flow of ions through these channels, particularly the na+ channels, regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon. this jumping of the action potential from one node to the next is called saltatory conduction. if nodes of ranvier were not present along an axon, the action potential would propagate very slowly since na+ and k+ channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials at every point along the axon instead of at specific points. nodes of ranvier also save energy for the neuron since the channels only need to be present at the nodes and not along the entire axon. the synapse or gap is the place where information is transmitted from one neuron to another. synapses usually form between axon terminals and dendritic spines, but this is not universally true. there are also axon-to-axon, dendrite-to-dendrite, and axon-to-cell body synapses. the neuron transmitting the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the neuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron. note that these designations are relative to a particular synapsemost neurons are both presynaptic and postsynaptic. there are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical. when an action potential reaches the axon terminal it depolarizes the membrane and opens voltage-gated na+ channels. na+ ions enter the cell, further depolarizing the presynaptic membrane. this depolarization causes voltage-gated ca2+ channels to open. calcium ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes small membrane-bound vesicles, called synaptic vesicles, containing neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. synaptic vesicles are shown in [link], which is an image from a scanning electron microscope. fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes neurotransmitter to be released into the synaptic cleft, the extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, as illustrated in [link]. the neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane. the binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion channels, in this case ligand-gated channels, on the postsynaptic membrane to open. neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic membrane, as detailed in [link]. for example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and muscle (called the neuromuscular junction) by a presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic na+ channels to open. na+ enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize. this depolarization is called an excitatory postsynaptic potential (epsp) and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential. release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps), a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane. for example, when the neurotransmitter gaba (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released from a presynaptic neuron, it binds to and opens cl- channels. cl- ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes the membrane, making the neuron less likely to fire an action potential. once neurotransmission has occurred, the neurotransmitter must be removed from the synaptic cleft so the postsynaptic membrane can reset and be ready to receive another signal. this can be accomplished in three ways: the neurotransmitter can diffuse away from the synaptic cleft, it can be degraded by enzymes in the synaptic cleft, or it can be recycled (sometimes called reuptake) by the presynaptic neuron. several drugs act at this step of neurotransmission. for example, some drugs that are given to alzheimers patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine. this inhibition of the enzyme essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine. once released, the acetylcholine stays in the cleft and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors. while electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical synapses, they are found in all nervous systems and play important and unique roles. the mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from that in chemical synapses. in an electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close together and are actually physically connected by channel proteins forming gap junctions. gap junctions allow current to pass directly from one cell to the next. in addition to the ions that carry this current, other molecules, such as atp, can diffuse through the large gap junction pores. there are key differences between chemical and electrical synapses. because chemical synapses depend on the release of neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their signal, there is an approximately one millisecond delay between when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when the neurotransmitter leads to opening of postsynaptic ion channels. additionally, this signaling is unidirectional. signaling in electrical synapses, in contrast, is virtually instantaneous (which is important for synapses involved in key reflexes), and some electrical synapses are bidirectional. electrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely to be blocked, and they are important for synchronizing the electrical activity of a group of neurons. for example, electrical synapses in the thalamus are thought to regulate slow-wave sleep, and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures. sometimes a single epsp is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create epsps around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential. this process is called summation and occurs at the axon hillock, as illustrated in [link]. additionally, one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neuronssome excitatory and some inhibitoryso ipsps can cancel out epsps and vice versa. it is the net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential. together, synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act as a filter so that random noise in the system is not transmitted as important information. brain-computer interface
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als, also called lou gehrigs disease) is a neurological disease characterized by the degeneration of the motor neurons that control voluntary movements. the disease begins with muscle weakening and lack of coordination and eventually destroys the neurons that control speech, breathing, and swallowing; in the end, the disease can lead to paralysis. at that point, patients require assistance from machines to be able to breathe and to communicate. several special technologies have been developed to allow locked-in patients to communicate with the rest of the world. one technology, for example, allows patients to type out sentences by twitching their cheek. these sentences can then be read aloud by a computer. a relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients, including those with als, to communicate and retain a degree of self-sufficiency is called brain-computer interface (bci) technology and is illustrated in [link]. this technology sounds like something out of science fiction: it allows paralyzed patients to control a computer using only their thoughts. there are several forms of bci. some forms use eeg recordings from electrodes taped onto the skull. these recordings contain information from large populations of neurons that can be decoded by a computer. other forms of bci require the implantation of an array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor cortex. this form of bci, while more invasive, is very powerful as each electrode can record actual action potentials from one or more neurons. these signals are then sent to a computer, which has been trained to decode the signal and feed it to a toolsuch as a cursor on a computer screen. this means that a patient with als can use e-mail, read the internet, and communicate with others by thinking of moving his or her hand or arm (even though the paralyzed patient cannot make that bodily movement). recent advances have allowed a paralyzed locked-in patient who suffered a stroke 15 years ago to control a robotic arm and even to feed herself coffee using bci technology. despite the amazing advancements in bci technology, it also has limitations. the technology can require many hours of training and long periods of intense concentration for the patient; it can also require brain surgery to implant the devices. watch this video in which a paralyzed woman use a brain-controlled robotic arm to bring a drink to her mouth, among other images of brain-computer interface technology in action.

 synapses are not static structures. they can be weakened or strengthened. they can be broken, and new synapses can be made. synaptic plasticity allows for these changes, which are all needed for a functioning nervous system. in fact, synaptic plasticity is the basis of learning and memory. two processes in particular, long-term potentiation (ltp) and long-term depression (ltd) are important forms of synaptic plasticity that occur in synapses in the hippocampus, a brain region that is involved in storing memories. long-term potentiation (ltp) is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection. ltp is based on the hebbian principle: cells that fire together wire together. there are various mechanisms, none fully understood, behind the synaptic strengthening seen with ltp. one known mechanism involves a type of postsynaptic glutamate receptor, called nmda (n-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors, shown in [link]. these receptors are normally blocked by magnesium ions; however, when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized by multiple presynaptic inputs in quick succession (either from one neuron or multiple neurons), the magnesium ions are forced out allowing ca ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell. next, ca2+ ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes a different type of glutamate receptor, called ampa (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors, to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane, since activated ampa receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell. so, the next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane, it will have a larger excitatory effect (epsp) on the postsynaptic cell because the binding of glutamate to these ampa receptors will allow more positive ions into the cell. the insertion of additional ampa receptors strengthens the synapse and means that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release. some drugs of abuse co-opt the ltp pathway, and this synaptic strengthening can lead to addiction. long-term depression (ltd) is essentially the reverse of ltp: it is a long-term weakening of a synaptic connection. one mechanism known to cause ltd also involves ampa receptors. in this situation, calcium that enters through nmda receptors initiates a different signaling cascade, which results in the removal of ampa receptors from the postsynaptic membrane, as illustrated in [link]. the decrease in ampa receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron. while it may seem counterintuitive, ltd may be just as important for learning and memory as ltp. the weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant connections to be lost and makes the synapses that have undergone ltp that much stronger by comparison. neurons have charged membranes because there are different concentrations of ions inside and outside of the cell. voltage-gated ion channels control the movement of ions into and out of a neuron. when a neuronal membrane is depolarized to at least the threshold of excitation, an action potential is fired. the action potential is then propagated along a myelinated axon to the axon terminals. in a chemical synapse, the action potential causes release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. through binding to postsynaptic receptors, the neurotransmitter can cause excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing, respectively, the postsynaptic membrane. in electrical synapses, the action potential is directly communicated to the postsynaptic cell through gap junctionslarge channel proteins that connect the pre-and postsynaptic membranes. synapses are not static structures and can be strengthened and weakened. two mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation and long-term depression.","[('refractory period', 'refractory periods'), ('nerve impulse transmission', 'nerve impulse transmissions', 'nerve impulses transmission', 'nerve impulses transmissions', 'nerves impulse transmission', 'nerves impulse transmissions', 'nerves impulses transmission', 'nerves impulses transmissions'), ('synaptic cleft', 'synaptic clefts'), ('excitatory postsynaptic potential', 'excitatory postsynaptic potentials', 'excitatories postsynaptic potential', 'excitatories postsynaptic potentials'), ('neuron communication', 'neuron communications'), ('signal summation', 'signal summations'), ('epsp', 'epsps'), ('chemical synapse', 'chemical synapses'), ('charged membrane', 'charged membranes'), ('ipsp', 'ipsps'), ('nervous system', 'nervous systems'), ('inhibitory postsynaptic potential ipsp', 'inhibitory postsynaptic potential ipsps', 'inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ipsp', 'inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ipsps'), ('synaptic plasticity', 'synaptic plasticities'), ('synaptic transmission', 'synaptic transmissions'), ('depolarization', 'depolarizations'), ('threshold of excitation', 'threshold of excitation', 'thresholds of excitation', 'thresholds of excitation'), ('action potential', 'action potentials'), ('long-term depression', 'long-term depressions'), ('brain-computer interface', 'brain-computer interfaces'), ('membrane potential', 'membrane potentials'), ('hyperpolarization', 'hyperpolarizations'), ('electrical synapse', 'electrical synapses'), ('ltd', 'ltds'), ('resting membrane potential', 'resting membrane potentials', 'resting membranes potential', 'resting membranes potentials'), ('action potential propagation', 'action potential propagations', 'actions potential propagation', 'actions potential propagations'), ('ltp', 'ltps'), ('summation', 'summations'), ('synaptic vesicle', 'synaptic vesicles'), ('long-term potentiation', 'long-term potentiations'), ('saltatory conduction', 'saltatory conductions')]"
181,stax-bio,35,The Nervous System,3,m44749,The Central Nervous System,"the central nervous system (cns) is made up of the brain, a part of which is shown in [link] and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges (from the greek word for membrane). the outermost layer is the dura mater (latin for hard mother). as the latin suggests, the primary function for this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal cord. the dura mater also contains vein-like structures that carry blood from the brain back to the heart. the middle layer is the web-like arachnoid mater. the last layer is the pia mater (latin for soft mother), which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord like plastic wrap. the space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (csf). csf is produced by a tissue called choroid plexus in fluid-filled compartments in the cns called ventricles. the brain floats in csf, which acts as a cushion and shock absorber and makes the brain neutrally buoyant. csf also functions to circulate chemical substances throughout the brain and into the spinal cord. the entire brain contains only about 8.5 tablespoons of csf, but csf is constantly produced in the ventricles. this creates a problem when a ventricle is blockedthe csf builds up and creates swelling and the brain is pushed against the skull. this swelling condition is called hydrocephalus (water head) and can cause seizures, cognitive problems, and even death if a shunt is not inserted to remove the fluid and pressure. the brain is the part of the central nervous system that is contained in the cranial cavity of the skull. it includes the cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. there are three different ways that a brain can be sectioned in order to view internal structures: a sagittal section cuts the brain left to right, as shown in [link]b, a coronal section cuts the brain front to back, as shown in [link]a, and a horizontal section cuts the brain top to bottom. the outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex, which is folded into hills called gyri (singular: gyrus) and valleys called sulci (singular: sulcus). the cortex is made up of two hemispheresright and leftwhich are separated by a large sulcus. a thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum (latin: tough body) connects the two hemispheres and allows information to be passed from one side to the other. although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant. in fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. while patients do suffer some deficits following the surgery, they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on children who have very immature nervous systems. in other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. this causes a condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres. for example, when an object is presented to patients left visual field, they may be unable to verbally name the object (and may claim to not have seen an object at all). this is because the visual input from the left visual field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then signal to the speech center, which generally is found in the left side of the brain. remarkably, if a split-brain patient is asked to pick up a specific object out of a group of objects with the left hand, the patient will be able to do so but will still be unable to vocally identify it. each cortical hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions. scientists use various techniques to determine what brain areas are involved in different functions: they examine patients who have had injuries or diseases that affect specific areas and see how those areas are related to functional deficits. they also conduct animal studies where they stimulate brain areas and see if there are any behavioral changes. they use a technique called transmagnetic stimulation (tms) to temporarily deactivate specific parts of the cortex using strong magnets placed outside the head; and they use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to look at changes in oxygenated blood flow in particular brain regions that correlate with specific behavioral tasks. these techniques, and others, have given great insight into the functions of different brain regions but have also showed that any given brain area can be involved in more than one behavior or process, and any given behavior or process generally involves neurons in multiple brain areas. that being said, each hemisphere of the mammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. [link] illustrates these four lobes of the human cerebral cortex. the frontal lobe is located at the front of the brain, over the eyes. this lobe contains the olfactory bulb, which processes smells. the frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex, which is important for planning and implementing movement. areas within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups, and there is some organization to this map, as shown in [link]. for example, the neurons that control movement of the fingers are next to the neurons that control movement of the hand. neurons in the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining attention, speech, and decision-making. studies of humans who have damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality, socialization, and assessing risk. the parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain. neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading. two of the parietal lobes main functions are processing somatosensationtouch sensations like pressure, pain, heat, coldand processing proprioceptionthe sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space. the parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex. the occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain. it is primarily involved in visionseeing, recognizing, and identifying the visual world. the temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain by your ears and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds. it also contains the hippocampus (greek for seahorse)a structure that processes memory formation. the hippocampus is illustrated in [link]. the role of the hippocampus in memory was partially determined by studying one famous epileptic patient, hm, who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. his seizures went away, but he could no longer form new memories (although he could remember some facts from before his surgery and could learn new motor tasks). 
compared to other vertebrates, mammals have exceptionally large brains for their body size. an entire alligators brain, for example, would fill about one and a half teaspoons. this increase in brain to body size ratio is especially pronounced in apes, whales, and dolphins. while this increase in overall brain size doubtlessly played a role in the evolution of complex behaviors unique to mammals, it does not tell the whole story. scientists have found a relationship between the relatively high surface area of the cortex and the intelligence and complex social behaviors exhibited by some mammals. this increased surface area is due, in part, to increased folding of the cortical sheet (more sulci and gyri). for example, a rat cortex is very smooth with very few sulci and gyri. cat and sheep cortices have more sulci and gyri. chimps, humans, and dolphins have even more. interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia (or basal nuclei), shown in [link]b, play important roles in movement control and posture. damage to the basal ganglia, as in parkinsons disease, leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait when walking. the basal ganglia also regulate motivation. for example, when a wasp sting led to bilateral basal ganglia damage in a 25-year-old businessman, he began to spend all his days in bed and showed no interest in anything or anybody. but when he was externally stimulatedas when someone asked to play a card game with himhe was able to function normally. interestingly, he and other similar patients do not report feeling bored or frustrated by their state. the thalamus (greek for inner chamber), illustrated in [link], acts as a gateway to and from the cortex. it receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex. this feedback mechanism can modulate conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and arousal state of the animal. the thalamus helps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states. a rare genetic disorder called fatal familial insomnia causes the degeneration of thalamic neurons and glia. this disorder prevents affected patients from being able to sleep, among other symptoms, and is eventually fatal. below the thalamus is the hypothalamus, shown in [link]. the hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to the pituitary gland, a pea-sized endocrine gland that releases several different hormones that affect other glands as well as other cells. this relationship means that the hypothalamus regulates important behaviors that are controlled by these hormones. the hypothalamus is the bodys thermostatit makes sure key functions like food and water intake, energy expenditure, and body temperature are kept at appropriate levels. neurons within the hypothalamus also regulate circadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles. the limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation. it plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus. one important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala (greek for almond), illustrated in [link]. the two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces. the cingulate gyrus helps regulate emotions and pain. the cerebellum (latin for little brain), shown in [link], sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem. the cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks. the brainstem, illustrated in [link], connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord. it consists of the midbrain, medulla oblongata, and the pons. motor and sensory neurons extend through the brainstem allowing for the relay of signals between the brain and spinal cord. ascending neural pathways cross in this section of the brain allowing the left hemisphere of the cerebrum to control the right side of the body and vice versa. the brainstem coordinates motor control signals sent from the brain to the body. the brainstem controls several important functions of the body including alertness, arousal, breathing, blood pressure, digestion, heart rate, swallowing, walking, and sensory and motor information integration. connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord, shown in [link]. the spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body. the spinal cord is contained within the bones of the vertebrate column but is able to communicate signals to and from the body through its connections with spinal nerves (part of the peripheral nervous system). a cross-section of the spinal cord looks like a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape, as illustrated in [link]. myelinated axons make up the white matter and neuron and glial cell bodies make up the gray matter. gray matter is also composed of interneurons, which connect two neurons each located in different parts of the body. axons and cell bodies in the dorsal (facing the back of the animal) spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain. axons and cell bodies in the ventral (facing the front of the animal) spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body. the spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. these reflexes are quick, unconscious movementslike automatically removing a hand from a hot object. reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections. for example, the knee reflex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron. while a reflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot). in the united states, there around 10,000 spinal cord injuries each year. because the spinal cord is the information superhighway connecting the brain with the body, damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis. the extent of the paralysis depends on the location of the injury along the spinal cord and whether the spinal cord was completely severed. for example, if the spinal cord is damaged at the level of the neck, it can cause paralysis from the neck down, whereas damage to the spinal column further down may limit paralysis to the legs. spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to treat because spinal nerves do not regenerate, although ongoing research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to act as a bridge to reconnect severed nerves. researchers are also looking at ways to prevent the inflammation that worsens nerve damage after injury. one such treatment is to pump the body with cold saline to induce hypothermia. this cooling can prevent swelling and other processes that are thought to worsen spinal cord injuries. the vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and the spinal cord, which are covered and protected by three meninges. the brain contains structurally and functionally defined regions. in mammals, these include the cortex (which can be broken down into four primary functional lobes: frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal), basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system, cerebellum, and brainstemalthough structures in some of these designations overlap. while functions may be primarily localized to one structure in the brain, most complex functions, like language and sleep, involve neurons in multiple brain regions. the spinal cord is the information superhighway that connects the brain with the rest of the body through its connections with peripheral nerves. it transmits sensory and motor input and also controls motor reflexes.","[('sulcus', 'sulcis', 'sulci'), ('basal nuclei', 'basal nucleis'), ('occipital lobe', 'occipital lobes'), ('sulcu', 'sulcuss', 'sulcus'), ('meninge', 'meninges'), ('choroid

182,stax-bio,35,The Nervous System,4,m44751,The Peripheral Nervous System,"the peripheral nervous system (pns) is the connection between the central nervous system and the rest of the body. the cns is like the power plant of the nervous system. it creates the signals that control the functions of the body. the pns is like the wires that go to individual houses. without those wires, the signals produced by the cns could not control the body (and the cns would not be able to receive sensory information from the body either). the pns can be broken down into the autonomic nervous system, which controls bodily functions without conscious control, and the sensory-somatic nervous system, which transmits sensory information from the skin, muscles, and sensory organs to the cns and sends motor commands from the cns to the muscles. the autonomic nervous system serves as the relay between the cns and the internal organs. it controls the lungs, the heart, smooth muscle, and exocrine and endocrine glands. the autonomic nervous system controls these organs largely without conscious control; it can continuously monitor the conditions of these different systems and implement changes as needed. signaling to the target tissue usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating in the cns) synapses to a neuron in a ganglion that, in turn, synapses on the target organ, as illustrated in [link]. there are two divisions of the autonomic nervous system that often have opposing effects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the fight or flight response that occurs when an animal encounters a dangerous situation. one way to remember this is to think of the surprise a person feels when encountering a snake (snake and sympathetic both begin with s). examples of functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system include an accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion. these functions help prepare an organisms body for the physical strain required to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a predator. most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system originate in the spinal cord, as illustrated in [link]. the axons of these neurons release acetylcholine on postganglionic neurons within sympathetic ganglia (the sympathetic ganglia form a chain that extends alongside the spinal cord). the acetylcholine activates the postganglionic neurons. postganglionic neurons then release norepinephrine onto target organs. as anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test, speech, or athletic event can attest, the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive. this is both because one preganglionic neuron synapses on multiple postganglionic neurons, amplifying the effect of the original synapse, and because the adrenal gland also releases norepinephrine (and the closely related hormone epinephrine) into the blood stream. the physiological effects of this norepinephrine release include dilating the trachea and bronchi (making it easier for the animal to breathe), increasing heart rate, and moving blood from the skin to the heart, muscles, and brain (so the animal can think and run). the strength and speed of the sympathetic response helps an organism avoid danger, and scientists have found evidence that it may also increase ltpallowing the animal to remember the dangerous situation and avoid it in the future. while the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations, the parasympathetic nervous system allows an animal to rest and digest. one way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic, the parasympathetic nervous system is in control (picnic and parasympathetic both start with p). parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral (toward the bottom) spinal cord, as shown in [link]. the axons of the preganglionic neurons release acetylcholine on the postganglionic neurons, which are generally located very near the target organs. most postganglionic neurons release acetylcholine onto target organs, although some release nitric oxide. the parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the sympathetic nervous system is activated (the common adrenaline dump you feel after a fight-or-flight event). effects of acetylcholine release on target organs include slowing of heart rate, lowered blood pressure, and stimulation of digestion. the sensory-somatic nervous system is made up of cranial and spinal nerves and contains both sensory and motor neurons. sensory neurons transmit sensory information from the skin, skeletal muscle, and sensory organs to the cns. motor neurons transmit messages about desired movement from the cns to the muscles to make them contract. without its sensory-somatic nervous system, an animal would be unable to process any information about its environment (what it sees, feels, hears, and so on) and could not control motor movements. unlike the autonomic nervous system, which has two synapses between the cns and the target organ, sensory and motor neurons have only one synapseone ending of the neuron is at the organ and the other directly contacts a cns neuron. acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter released at these synapses. humans have 12 cranial nerves, nerves that emerge from or enter the skull (cranium), as opposed to the spinal nerves, which emerge from the vertebral column. each cranial nerve is accorded a name, which are detailed in [link]. some cranial nerves transmit only sensory information. for example, the olfactory nerve transmits information about smells from the nose to the brainstem. other cranial nerves transmit almost solely motor information. for example, the oculomotor nerve controls the opening and closing of the eyelid and some eye movements. other cranial nerves contain a mix of sensory and motor fibers. for example, the glossopharyngeal nerve has a role in both taste (sensory) and swallowing (motor). spinal nerves transmit sensory and motor information between the spinal cord and the rest of the body. each of the 31 spinal nerves (in humans) contains both sensory and motor axons. the sensory neuron cell bodies are grouped in structures called dorsal root ganglia and are shown in [link]. each sensory neuron has one projectionwith a sensory receptor ending in skin, muscle, or sensory organsand another that synapses with a neuron in the dorsal spinal cord. motor neurons have cell bodies in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord that project to muscle through the ventral root. these neurons are usually stimulated by interneurons within the spinal cord but are sometimes directly stimulated by sensory neurons. the peripheral nervous system contains both the autonomic and sensory-somatic nervous systems. the autonomic nervous system provides unconscious control over visceral functions and has two divisions: the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations to prepare the animal for a fight or flight response. the parasympathetic nervous system is active during restful periods. the sensory-somatic nervous system is made of cranial and spinal nerves that transmit sensory information from skin and muscle to the cns and motor commands from the cns to the muscles.","[('parasympathetic nervous system', 'parasympathetic nervous systems'), ('sensory-somatic nervous system',

183,stax-bio,35,The Nervous System,5,m44752,Nervous System Disorders,"a nervous system that functions correctly is a fantastically complex, well-oiled machinesynapses fire appropriately, muscles move when needed, memories are formed and stored, and emotions are well regulated. unfortunately, each year millions of people in the united states deal with some sort of nervous system disorder. while scientists have discovered potential causes of many of these diseases, and viable treatments for some, ongoing research seeks to find ways to better prevent and treat all of these disorders. neurodegenerative disorders are illnesses characterized by a loss of nervous system functioning that are usually caused by neuronal death. these diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons die. the symptoms of a particular neurodegenerative disease are related to where in the nervous system the death of neurons occurs. spinocerebellar ataxia, for example, leads to neuronal death in the cerebellum. the death of these neurons causes problems in balance and walking. neurodegenerative disorders include huntingtons disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, alzheimers disease and other types of dementia disorders, and parkinsons disease. here, alzheimers and parkinsons disease will be discussed in more depth. alzheimers disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. in 2012, an estimated 5.4 million americans suffered from alzheimers disease, and payments for their care are estimated at $200 billion. roughly one in every eight people age 65 or older has the disease. due to the aging of the baby-boomer generation, there are projected to be as many as 13 million alzheimers patients in the united states in the year 2050. symptoms of alzheimers disease include disruptive memory loss, confusion about time or place, difficulty planning or executing tasks, poor judgment, and personality changes. problems smelling certain scents can also be indicative of alzheimers disease and may serve as an early warning sign. many of these symptoms are also common in people who are aging normally, so it is the severity and longevity of the symptoms that determine whether a person is suffering from alzheimers. alzheimers disease was named for alois alzheimer, a german psychiatrist who published a report in 1911 about a woman who showed severe dementia symptoms. along with his colleagues, he examined the womans brain following her death and reported the presence of abnormal clumps, which are now called amyloid plaques, along with tangled brain fibers called neurofibrillary tangles. amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and an overall shrinking of brain volume are commonly seen in the brains of alzheimers patients. loss of neurons in the hippocampus is especially severe in advanced alzheimers patients. [link] compares a normal brain to the brain of an alzheimers patient. many research groups are examining the causes of these hallmarks of the disease. one form of the disease is usually caused by mutations in one of three known genes. this rare form of early onset alzheimers disease affects fewer than five percent of patients with the disease and causes dementia beginning between the ages of 30 and 60. the more prevalent, late-onset form of the disease likely also has a genetic component. one particular gene, apolipoprotein e (apoe) has a variant (e4) that increases a carriers likelihood of getting the disease. many other genes have been identified that might be involved in the pathology. unfortunately, there is no cure for alzheimers disease. current treatments focus on managing the symptoms of the disease. because decrease in the activity of cholinergic neurons (neurons that use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) is common in alzheimers disease, several drugs used to treat the disease work by increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission, often by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. other clinical interventions focus on behavioral therapies like psychotherapy, sensory therapy, and cognitive exercises. since alzheimers disease appears to hijack the normal aging process, research into prevention is prevalent. smoking, obesity, and cardiovascular problems may be risk factors for the disease, so treatments for those may also help to prevent alzheimers disease. some studies have shown that people who remain intellectually active by playing games, reading, playing musical instruments, and being socially active in later life have a reduced risk of developing the disease. like alzheimers disease, parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative disease. it was first characterized by james parkinson in 1817. each year, 50,000-60,000 people in the united states are diagnosed with the disease. parkinsons disease causes the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, a midbrain structure that regulates movement. loss of these neurons causes many symptoms including tremor (shaking of fingers or a limb), slowed movement, speech changes, balance and posture problems, and rigid muscles. the combination of these symptoms often causes a characteristic slow hunched shuffling walk, illustrated in [link]. patients with parkinsons disease can also exhibit psychological symptoms, such as dementia or emotional problems. although some patients have a form of the disease known to be caused by a single mutation, for most patients the exact causes of parkinsons disease remain unknown: the disease likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors (similar to alzheimers disease). post-mortem analysis of brains from parkinsons patients shows the presence of lewy bodiesabnormal protein clumpsin dopaminergic neurons. the prevalence of these lewy bodies often correlates with the severity of the disease. there is no cure for parkinsons disease, and treatment is focused on easing symptoms. one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for parkinsons is l-dopa, which is a chemical that is converted into dopamine by neurons in the brain. this conversion increases the overall level of dopamine neurotransmission and can help compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. other drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down dopamine. neurodevelopmental disorders occur when the development of the nervous system is disturbed. there are several different classes of neurodevelopmental disorders. some, like down syndrome, cause intellectual deficits. others specifically affect communication, learning, or the motor system. some disorders like autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder have complex symptoms. autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a neurodevelopmental disorder. its severity differs from person to person. estimates for the prevalence of the disorder have changed rapidly in the past few decades. current estimates suggest that one in 88 children will develop the disorder. asd is four times more prevalent in males than females. a characteristic symptom of asd is impaired social skills. children with autism may have difficulty making and maintaining eye contact and reading social cues. they also may have problems feeling empathy for others. other symptoms of asd include repetitive motor behaviors (such as rocking back and forth), preoccupation with specific subjects, strict adherence to certain rituals, and unusual language use. up to 30 percent of patients with asd develop epilepsy, and patients with some forms of the disorder (like fragile x) also have intellectual disability. because it is a spectrum disorder, other asd patients are very functional and have good-to-excellent language skills. many of these patients do not feel that they suffer from a disorder and instead think that their brains just process information differently. except for some well-characterized, clearly genetic forms of autism (like fragile x and retts syndrome), the causes of asd are largely unknown. variants of several genes correlate with the presence of asd, but for any given patient, many different mutations in different genes may be required for the disease to develop. at a general level, asd is thought to be a disease of incorrect wiring. accordingly, brains of some asd patients lack the same level of synaptic pruning that occurs in non-affected people. in the 1990s, a research paper linked autism to a common vaccine given to children. this paper was retracted when it was discovered that the author falsified data, and follow-up studies showed no connection between vaccines and autism. treatment for autism usually combines behavioral therapies and interventions, along with medications to treat other disorders common to people with autism (depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder). although early interventions can help mitigate the effects of the disease, there is currently no cure for asd. approximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd). like asd, adhd is more prevalent in males than females. symptoms of the disorder include inattention (lack of focus), executive functioning difficulties, impulsivity, and hyperactivity beyond what is characteristic of the normal developmental stage. some patients do not have the hyperactive component of symptoms and are diagnosed with a subtype of adhd: attention deficit disorder (add). many people with adhd also show comorbitity, in that they develop secondary disorders in addition to adhd. examples include depression or obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd). [link] provides some statistics concerning comorbidity with adhd. the cause of adhd is unknown, although research points to a delay and dysfunction in the development of the prefrontal cortex and disturbances in neurotransmission. according to studies of twins, the disorder has a strong genetic component. there are several candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder, but no definitive links have been discovered. environmental factors, including exposure to certain pesticides, may also contribute to the development of adhd in some patients. treatment for adhd often involves behavioral therapies and the prescription of stimulant medications, which paradoxically cause a calming effect in these patients. neurologist
neurologists are physicians who specialize in disorders of the nervous system. they diagnose and treat disorders such as epilepsy, stroke, dementia, nervous system injuries, parkinsons disease, sleep disorders, and multiple sclerosis. neurologists are medical doctors who have attended college, medical school, and completed three to four years of neurology residency. when examining a new patient, a neurologist takes a full medical history and performs a complete physical exam. the physical exam contains specific tasks that are used to determine what areas of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system may be damaged. for example, to check whether the hypoglossal nerve is functioning correctly, the neurologist will ask the patient to move his or her tongue in different ways. if the patient does not have full control over tongue movements, then the hypoglossal nerve may be damaged or there may be a lesion in the brainstem where the cell bodies of these neurons reside (or there could be damage to the tongue muscle itself). neurologists have other tools besides a physical exam they can use to diagnose particular problems in the nervous system. if the patient has had a seizure, for example, the neurologist can use electroencephalography (eeg), which involves taping electrodes to the scalp to record brain activity, to try to determine which brain regions are involved in the seizure. in suspected stroke patients, a neurologist can use a computerized tomography (ct) scan, which is a type of x-ray, to look for bleeding in the brain or a possible brain tumor. to treat patients with neurological problems, neurologists can prescribe medications or refer the patient to a neurosurgeon for surgery. mental illnesses are nervous system disorders that result in problems with thinking, mood, or relating with other people. these disorders are severe enough to affect a persons quality of life and often make it difficult for people to perform the routine tasks of daily living. debilitating mental disorders plague approximately 12.5 million americans (about 1 in 17 people) at an annual cost of more than $300 billion. there are several types of mental disorders including schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders and phobias, post-traumatic stress disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), among others. the american psychiatric association publishes the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (or dsm), which describes the symptoms required for a patient to be diagnosed with a particular mental disorder. each newly released version of the dsm contains different symptoms and classifications as scientists learn more about these disorders, their causes, and how they relate to each other. a more detailed discussion of two mental illnessesschizophrenia and major depressionis given below. schizophrenia is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the united states. symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination, inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses, difficulty thinking, and problems with social situations. people with schizophrenia can suffer from hallucinations and hear voices; they may also suffer from delusions. patients also have so-called negative symptoms like a flattened emotional state, loss of pleasure, and loss of basic drives. many schizophrenic patients are diagnosed in their late adolescence or early 20s. the development of schizophrenia is thought to involve malfunctioning dopaminergic neurons and may also involve problems with glutamate signaling. treatment for the disease usually requires antipsychotic medications that work by blocking dopamine receptors and decreasing dopamine neurotransmission in the brain. this decrease in dopamine can cause parkinsons disease-like symptoms in some patients. while some classes of antipsychotics can be quite effective at treating the disease, they are not a cure, and most patients must remain medicated for the rest of their lives. major depression affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the united states each year and is one of the most common mental disorders. to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder, a person must have experienced a severely depressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously enjoyed, changes in appetite and sleep schedules, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts. the exact causes of major depression are unknown and likely include both genetic and environmental risk factors. some research supports the classic monoamine hypothesis, which suggests that depression is caused by a decrease in norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission. one argument against this hypothesis is the fact that some antidepressant medications cause an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin release within a few hours of beginning treatmentbut clinical results of these medications are not seen until weeks later. this has led to alternative hypotheses: for example, dopamine may also be decreased in depressed patients, or it may actually be an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin that causes the disease, and antidepressants force a feedback loop that decreases this release. treatments for depression include psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, deep-brain stimulation, and prescription medications. there are several classes of antidepressant medications that work through different mechanisms. for example, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (mao inhibitors) block the enzyme that degrades many neurotransmitters (including dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine), resulting in increased neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) block the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron. this blockage results in an increase in serotonin in the synaptic cleft. other types of drugs such as norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also used to treat depression. there are several other neurological disorders that cannot be easily placed in the above categories. these include chronic pain conditions, cancers of the nervous system, epilepsy disorders, and stroke. epilepsy and stroke are discussed below. estimates suggest that up to three percent of people in the united states will be diagnosed with epilepsy in their lifetime. while there are several different types of epilepsy, all are characterized by recurrent seizures. epilepsy itself can be a symptom of a brain injury, disease, or other illness. for example, people who have intellectual disability or asd can experience seizures, presumably because the developmental wiring malfunctions that caused their disorders also put them at risk for epilepsy. for many patients, however, the cause of their epilepsy is never identified and is likely to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. often, seizures can be controlled with anticonvulsant medications. however, for very severe cases, patients may undergo brain surgery to remove the brain area where seizures originate. a stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage. without the oxygen supplied by blood flow, neurons in this brain region die. this neuronal death can cause many different symptomsdepending on the brain area affected including headache, muscle weakness or paralysis, speech disturbances, sensory problems, memory loss, and confusion. stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting of a weak blood vessel. strokes are extremely common and are the third most common cause of death in the united states. on average one person experiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the united states. approximately 75 percent of strokes occur in people older than 65. risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a family history of stroke. smoking doubles the risk of stroke. because a stroke is a medical emergency, patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to the emergency room, where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed. these drugs will not work if the stroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three hours before arriving at the hospital. treatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication (to prevent future strokes) and (sometimes intense) physical therapy. some general themes emerge from the sampling of nervous system disorders presented above. the causes for most disorders are not fully understoodat least not for all patientsand likely involve a combination of nature (genetic mutations that become risk factors) and nurture (emotional trauma, stress, hazardous chemical exposure). because the causes have yet to be fully determined, treatment options are often lacking and only address symptoms.","[(""alzheimer' disease"", ""alzheimer' diseases""), ('neurological disorder', 'neurological disorders'), ('attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'attention

185,stax-bio,36,Sensory Systems,1,m44754,Sensory Processes,"senses provide information about the body and its environment.  humans have five special senses: olfaction (smell), gustation (taste), equilibrium (balance and body position), vision, and hearing. additionally, we possess general senses, also called somatosensation, which respond to stimuli like temperature, pain, pressure, and vibration. vestibular sensation, which is an organisms sense of spatial orientation and balance, proprioception (position of bones, joints, and muscles), and the sense of limb position that is used to track kinesthesia (limb movement) are part of somatosensation. although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different, all share a common function: to convert a stimulus (such as light, or sound, or the position of the body) into an electrical signal in the nervous system. this process is called sensory transduction. there are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction. in one, a neuron works with a sensory receptor, a cell, or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus. stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron, which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system. in the second type of sensory transduction, a sensory nerve ending responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment: this neuron constitutes the sensory receptor. free nerve endings can be stimulated by several different stimuli, thus showing little receptor specificity. for example, pain receptors in your gums and teeth may be stimulated by temperature changes, chemical stimulation, or pressure. the first step in sensation is reception, which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli (being bent or squished, for example), chemicals, or temperature. the receptor can then respond to the stimuli. the region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus, be it far away or in contact with the body, is that receptors receptive field. think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses. for the sense of touch, a stimulus must come into contact with body. for the sense of hearing, a stimulus can be a moderate distance away (some baleen whale sounds can propagate for many kilometers). for vision, a stimulus can be very far away; for example, the visual system perceives light from stars at enormous distances. the most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system. this takes place at the sensory receptor, and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the receptor potential. how is sensory input, such as pressure on the skin, changed to a receptor potential? in this example, a type of receptor called a mechanoreceptor (as shown in [link]) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure. disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron, changing its electrical potential. recall that in the nervous system, a positive change of a neurons electrical potential (also called the membrane potential), depolarizes the neuron. receptor potentials are graded potentials: the magnitude of these graded (receptor) potentials varies with the strength of the stimulus. if the magnitude of depolarization is sufficient (that is, if membrane potential reaches a threshold), the neuron will fire an action potential. in most cases, the correct stimulus impinging on a sensory receptor will drive membrane potential in a positive direction, although for some receptors, such as those in the visual system, this is not always the case. sensory receptors for different senses are very different from each other, and they are specialized according to the type of stimulus they sense: they have receptor specificity. for example, touch receptors, light receptors, and sound receptors are each activated by different stimuli. touch receptors are not sensitive to light or sound; they are sensitive only to touch or pressure. however, stimuli may be combined at higher levels in the brain, as happens with olfaction, contributing to our sense of taste. four aspects of sensory information are encoded by sensory systems: the type of stimulus, the location of the stimulus in the receptive field, the duration of the stimulus, and the relative intensity of the stimulus. thus, action potentials transmitted over a sensory receptors afferent axons encode one type of stimulus, and this segregation of the senses is preserved in other sensory circuits. for example, auditory receptors transmit signals over their own dedicated system, and electrical activity in the axons of the auditory receptors will be interpreted by the brain as an auditory stimulusa sound. the intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor. thus, an intense stimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials, and reducing the stimulus will likewise slow the rate of production of action potentials. a second way in which intensity is encoded is by the number of receptors activated. an intense stimulus might initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent receptors, while a less intense stimulus might stimulate fewer receptors. integration of sensory information begins as soon as the information is received in the cns, and the brain will further process incoming signals. 
perception is an individuals interpretation of a sensation. although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors, perception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor, but at higher levels in the nervous system, in the brain. the brain distinguishes sensory stimuli through a sensory pathway: action potentials from sensory receptors travel along neurons that are dedicated to a particular stimulus. these neurons are dedicated to that particular stimulus and synapse with particular neurons in the brain or spinal cord. all sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, are transmitted though the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus and to the appropriate region of the cortex. recall that the thalamus is a structure in the forebrain that serves as a clearinghouse and relay station for sensory (as well as motor) signals. when the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex ([link]) dedicated to processing that particular sense. how are neural signals interpreted? interpretation of sensory signals between individuals of the same species is largely similar, owing to the inherited similarity of their nervous systems; however, there are some individual differences. a good example of this is individual tolerances to a painful stimulus, such as dental pain, which certainly differ. just-noticeable differenceit is easy to differentiate between a one-pound bag of rice and a two-pound bag of rice. there is a one-pound difference, and one bag is twice as heavy as the other. however, would it be as easy to differentiate between a 20- and a 21-pound bag? question: what is the smallest detectible weight difference between a one-pound bag of rice and a larger bag? what is the smallest detectible difference between a 20-pound bag and a larger bag? in both cases, at what weights are the differences detected? this smallest detectible difference in stimuli is known as the just-noticeable difference (jnd). background: research background literature on jnd and on webers law, a description of a proposed mathematical relationship between the overall magnitude of the stimulus and the jnd. you will be testing jnd of different weights of rice in bags. choose a convenient increment that is to be stepped through while testing. for example, you could choose 10 percent increments between one and two pounds (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and so on) or 20 percent increments (1.2, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8). hypothesis: develop a hypothesis about jnd in terms of percentage of the whole weight being tested (such as the jnd between the two small bags and between the two large bags is proportionally the same, or . . . is not proportionally the same.) so, for the first hypothesis, if the jnd between the one-pound bag and a larger bag is 0.2 pounds (that is, 20 percent; 1.0 pound feels the same as 1.1 pounds, but 1.0 pound feels less than 1.2 pounds), then the jnd between the 20-pound bag and a larger bag will also be 20 percent. (so, 20 pounds feels the same as 22 pounds or 23 pounds, but 20 pounds feels less than 24 pounds.) test the hypothesis: enlist 24 participants, and split them into two groups of 12. to set up the demonstration, assuming a 10 percent increment was selected, have the first group be the one-pound group. as a counter-balancing measure against a systematic error, however, six of the first group will compare one pound to two pounds, and step down in weight (1.0 to 2.0, 1.0 to 1.9, and so on.), while the other six will step up (1.0 to 1.1, 1.0 to 1.2, and so on). apply the same principle to the 20-pound group (20 to 40, 20 to 38, and so on, and 20 to 22, 20 to 24, and so on). given the large difference between 20 and 40 pounds, you may wish to use 30 pounds as your larger weight. in any case, use two weights that are easily detectable as different. record the observations: record the data in a table similar to the table below. for the one-pound and 20-pound groups (base weights) record a plus sign (+) for each participant that detects a difference between the base weight and the step weight. record a minus sign (-) for each participant that finds no difference. if one-tenth steps were not used, then replace the steps in the step weight columns with the step you are using. analyze the data/report the results: what step weight did all participants find to be equal with one-pound base weight? what about the 20-pound group? draw a conclusion: did the data support the hypothesis? are the final weights proportionally the same? if not, why not? do the findings adhere to webers law? webers law states that the concept that a just-noticeable difference in a stimulus is proportional to the magnitude of the original stimulus. a sensory activation occurs when a physical or chemical stimulus is processed into a neural signal (sensory transduction) by a sensory receptor. perception is an individual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain function. humans have special senses: olfaction, gustation, equilibrium, and hearing, plus the general senses of somatosensation. sensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with sensory neurons or the specialized ends of sensory neurons that are a part of the peripheral nervous system, and they are used to receive information about the environment (internal or external). each sensory receptor is modified for the type of stimulus it detects. for example, neither gustatory receptors nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light. each sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific region in space, which is known as that receptors receptive field. the most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system. all sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, enter the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus. when the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex dedicated to processing that particular sense.","[('perception', 'perceptions'), ('transduction', 'transductions'), ('reception', 'receptions'), ('sensory system', 'sensory systems'), ('receptive field', 'receptive fields'), ('vestibular sense', 'vestibular senses'), ('sensory receptor', 'sensory receptors'), ('just-noticeable difference', 'just-noticeable differences'), ('kinesthesium', 'kinesthesias', 'kinesthesia'), ('mechanoreceptor', 'mechanoreceptors'), ('sensory proces', 'sensory processes', 'sensory process'), ('receptor potential', 'receptor potentials'), ('five sense', 'five sensess', 'five senses'), ('sensory perception', 'sensory perceptions'), ('proprioception', 'proprioceptions'), ('sense', 'senses'), ('sensory transduction', 'sensory transductions')]"
186,stax-bio,36,Sensory Systems,2,m44757,Somatosensation,"somatosensation is a mixed sensory category and includes all sensation received from the skin and mucous membranes, as well from as the limbs and joints. somatosensation is also known as tactile sense, or more familiarly, as the sense of touch. somatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the body and at some interior locations as well. a variety of receptor typesembedded in the skin, mucous membranes, muscles, joints, internal organs, and cardiovascular systemplay a role. recall that the epidermis is the outermost layer of skin in mammals. it is relatively thin, is composed of keratin-filled cells, and has no blood supply. the epidermis serves as a barrier to water and to invasion by pathogens. below this, the much thicker dermis contains blood vessels, sweat glands, hair follicles, lymph vessels, and lipid-secreting sebaceous glands ([link]). below the epidermis and dermis is the subcutaneous tissue, or hypodermis, the fatty layer that contains blood vessels, connective tissue, and the axons of sensory neurons. the hypodermis, which holds about 50 percent of the bodys fat, attaches the dermis to the bone and muscle, and supplies nerves and blood vessels to the dermis. sensory receptors are classified into five categories: mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, proprioceptors, pain receptors, and chemoreceptors. these categories are based on the nature of stimuli each receptor class transduces. what is commonly referred to as touch involves more than one kind of stimulus and more than one kind of receptor. mechanoreceptors in the skin are described as encapsulated (that is, surrounded by a capsule) or unencapsulated (a group that includes free nerve endings). a free nerve ending, as its name implies, is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron. free nerve endings are the most common nerve endings in skin, and they extend into the middle of the epidermis. free nerve endings are sensitive to painful stimuli, to hot and cold, and to light touch. they are slow to adjust to a stimulus and so are less sensitive to abrupt changes in stimulation. there are three classes of mechanoreceptors: tactile, proprioceptors, and baroreceptors. mechanoreceptors sense stimuli due to physical deformation of their plasma membranes. they contain mechanically gated ion channels whose gates open or close in response to pressure, touch, stretching, and sound. there are four primary tactile mechanoreceptors in human skin: merkels disks, meissners corpuscles, ruffini endings, and pacinian corpuscle; two are located toward the surface of the skin and two are located deeper. a fifth type of mechanoreceptor, krause end bulbs, are found only in specialized regions. merkels disks (shown in [link]) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis, both in skin that has hair and on glabrous skin, that is, the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers, the soles of the feet, and the lips of humans and other primates. merkels disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips. they are slow-adapting, encapsulated nerve endings, and they respond to light touch. light touch, also known as discriminative touch, is a light pressure that allows the location of a stimulus to be pinpointed. the receptive fields of merkels disks are small with well-defined borders. that makes them finely sensitive to edges and they come into use in tasks such as typing on a keyboard. meissners corpuscles, (shown in [link]) also known as tactile corpuscles, are found in the upper dermis, but they project into the epidermis. they, too, are found primarily in the glabrous skin on the fingertips and eyelids. they respond to fine touch and pressure, but they also respond to low-frequency vibration or flutter. they are rapidly adapting, fluid-filled, encapsulated neurons with small, well-defined borders and are responsive to fine details. like merkels disks, meissners corpuscles are not as plentiful in the palms as they are in the fingertips. deeper in the epidermis, near the base, are ruffini endings, which are also known as bulbous corpuscles. they are found in both glabrous and hairy skin. these are slow-adapting, encapsulated mechanoreceptors that detect skin stretch and deformations within joints, so they provide valuable feedback for gripping objects and controlling finger position and movement. thus, they also contribute to proprioception and kinesthesia. ruffini endings also detect warmth. note that these warmth detectors are situated deeper in the skin than are the cold detectors. it is not surprising, then, that humans detect cold stimuli before they detect warm stimuli. pacinian corpuscles (seen in [link]) are located deep in the dermis of both glabrous and hairy skin and are structurally similar to meissners corpuscles; they are found in the bone periosteum, joint capsules, pancreas and other viscera, breast, and genitals. they are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that sense deep transient (but not prolonged) pressure and high-frequency vibration. pacinian receptors detect pressure and vibration by being compressed, stimulating their internal dendrites. there are fewer pacinian corpuscles and ruffini endings in skin than there are merkels disks and meissners corpuscles. in proprioception, proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals travel through myelinated afferent neurons running from the spinal cord to the medulla. neurons are not physically connected, but communicate via neurotransmitters secreted into synapses or gaps between communicating neurons. once in the medulla, the neurons continue carrying the signals to the thalamus. muscle spindles are stretch receptors that detect the amount of stretch, or lengthening of muscles. related to these are golgi tendon organs, which are tension receptors that detect the force of muscle contraction. proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals come from limbs. unconscious proprioceptive signals run from the spinal cord to the cerebellum, the brain region that coordinates muscle contraction, rather than to the thalamus, like most other sensory information. barorecptors detect pressure changes in an organ. they are found in the walls of the carotid artery and the aorta where they monitor blood pressure, and in the lungs where they detect the degree of lung expansion. stretch receptors are found at various sites in the digestive and urinary systems. in addition to these two types of deeper receptors, there are also rapidly adapting hair receptors, which are found on nerve endings that wrap around the base of hair follicles. there are a few types of hair receptors that detect slow and rapid hair movement, and they differ in their sensitivity to movement. some hair receptors also detect skin deflection, and certain rapidly adapting hair receptors allow detection of stimuli that have not yet touched the skin. the configuration of the different types of receptors working in concert in human skin results in a very refined sense of touch. the nociceptive receptorsthose that detect painare located near the surface. small, finely calibrated mechanoreceptorsmerkels disks and meissners corpusclesare located in the upper layers and can precisely localize even gentle touch. the large mechanoreceptorspacinian corpuscles and ruffini endingsare located in the lower layers and respond to deeper touch. (consider that the deep pressure that reaches those deeper receptors would not need to be finely localized.) both the upper and lower layers of the skin hold rapidly and slowly adapting receptors. both primary somatosensory cortex and secondary cortical areas are responsible for processing the complex picture of stimuli transmitted from the interplay of mechanoreceptors. the distribution of touch receptors in human skin is not consistent over the body. in humans, touch receptors are less dense in skin covered with any type of hair, such as the arms, legs, torso, and face. touch receptors are denser in glabrous skin (the type found on human fingertips and lips, for example), which is typically more sensitive and is thicker than hairy skin (4 to 5 mm versus 2 to 3 mm). how is receptor density estimated in a human subject? the relative density of pressure receptors in different locations on the body can be demonstrated experimentally using a two-point discrimination test. in this demonstration, two sharp points, such as two thumbtacks, are brought into contact with the subjects skin (though not hard enough to cause pain or break the skin). the subject reports if he or she feels one point or two points. if the two points are felt as one point, it can be inferred that the two points are both in the receptive field of a single sensory receptor. if two points are felt as two separate points, each is in the receptive field of two separate sensory receptors. the points could then be moved closer and re-tested until the subject reports feeling only one point, and the size of the receptive field of a single receptor could be estimated from that distance. in addition to krause end bulbs that detect cold and ruffini endings that detect warmth, there are different types of cold receptors on some free nerve endings: thermoreceptors, located in the dermis, skeletal muscles, liver, and hypothalamus, that are activated by different temperatures. their pathways into the brain run from the spinal cord through the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex. warmth and cold information from the face travels through one of the cranial nerves to the brain. you know from experience that a tolerably cold or hot stimulus can quickly progress to a much more intense stimulus that is no longer tolerable. any stimulus that is too intense can be perceived as pain because temperature sensations are conducted along the same pathways that carry pain sensations 
pain is the name given to nociception, which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage. pain is caused by true sources of injury, such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive chemical. but pain also can be caused by harmless stimuli that mimic the action of damaging stimuli, such as contact with capsaicins, the compounds that cause peppers to taste hot and which are used in self-defense pepper sprays and certain topical medications. peppers taste hot because the protein receptors that bind capsaicin open the same calcium channels that are activated by warm receptors. nociception starts at the sensory receptors, but pain, inasmuch as it is the perception of nociception, does not start until it is communicated to the brain. there are several nociceptive pathways to and through the brain. most axons carrying nociceptive information into the brain from the spinal cord project to the thalamus (as do other sensory neurons) and the neural signal undergoes final processing in the primary somatosensory cortex. interestingly, one nociceptive pathway projects not to the thalamus but directly to the hypothalamus in the forebrain, which modulates the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine functions of the autonomic nervous system. recall that threateningor painfulstimuli stimulate the sympathetic branch of the visceral sensory system, readying a fight-or-flight response. view this video that animates the five phases of nociceptive pain.

 somatosensation includes all sensation received from the skin and mucous membranes, as well as from the limbs and joints. somatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the body and at some interior locations as well, and a variety of receptor types, embedded in the skin and mucous membranes, play a role. there are several types of specialized sensory receptors. rapidly adapting free nerve endings detect nociception, hot and cold, and light touch. slowly adapting, encapsulated merkels disks are found in fingertips and lips, and respond to light touch. meissners corpuscles, found in glabrous skin, are rapidly adapting, encapsulated receptors that detect touch, low-frequency vibration, and flutter. ruffini endings are slowly adapting, encapsulated receptors that detect skin stretch, joint activity, and warmth. hair receptors are rapidly adapting nerve endings wrapped around the base of hair follicles that detect hair movement and skin deflection. finally, pacinian corpuscles are encapsulated, rapidly adapting receptors that detect transient pressure and high-frequency vibration.","[('bulbous corpuscle', 'bulbous corpuscles'), ('somatosensation', 'somatosensations'), ('propriorception', 'propriorceptions'), ('sensory system', 'sensory systems'), ('golgi tendon organ', 'golgi tendon organs', 'golgis tendon organ', 'golgis tendon organs'), ('pacinian corpuscle', 'pacinian corpuscles'), ('pain', 'pains'), ('muscle spindle', 'muscle spindles'), ('skin sensor', 'skin sensors'), ('krause end bulb', 'krause end bulbs', 'krause ends bulb', 'krause ends bulbs', 'krauses end bulb', 'krauses end bulbs', 'krauses ends bulb', 'krauses ends bulbs'), ('tactile corpuscle', 'tactile corpuscles'), ('somatosensory receptor', 'somatosensory receptors'), (""merkel' disc"", ""merkel' discs""), ('mechanoreceptor density', 'mechanoreceptor densities'), ('sense', 'senses'), (""meissner' corpuscle"", ""meissner' corpuscles""), ('glabrou', 'glabrouss', 'glabrous'), ('nociception', 'nociceptions'), ('ruffini ending', 'ruffini endings'), ('bulboid corpuscle', 'bulboid corpuscles'), ('thermoreception', 'thermoreceptions'), ('free nerve ending', 'free nerve endings', 'free nerves ending', 'free nerves endings'), ('mechanoreceptor', 'mechanoreceptors')]"
187,stax-bio,36,Sensory Systems,3,m44764,Taste and Smell,"taste, also called gustation, and smell, also called olfaction, are the most interconnected senses in that both involve molecules of the stimulus entering the body and bonding to receptors. smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other animalswhether potential mates, predators, or preyor other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival. similarly, the sense of taste allows animals to discriminate between types of foods. while the value of a sense of smell is obvious, what is the value of a sense of taste? different tasting foods have different attributes, both helpful and harmful. for example, sweet-tasting substances tend to be highly caloric, which could be necessary for survival in lean times. bitterness is associated with toxicity, and sourness is associated with spoiled food. salty foods are valuable in maintaining homeostasis by helping the body retain water and by providing ions necessary for cells to function. both taste and odor stimuli are molecules taken in from the environment. the primary tastes detected by humans are sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. the first four tastes need little explanation. the identification of umami as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recentlyit was identified in 1908 by japanese scientist kikunae ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth, but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later. the taste of umami, also known as savoriness, is attributable to the taste of the amino acid l-glutamate. in fact, monosodium glutamate, or msg, is often used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods. what is the adaptive value of being able to distinguish umami? savory substances tend to be high in protein. all odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe. if a substance does not release molecules into the air from its surface, it has no smell. and if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that recognizes a specific molecule, then that molecule has no smell. humans have about 350 olfactory receptor subtypes that work in various combinations to allow us to sense about 10,000 different odors. compare that to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory receptor types, and therefore probably sense more odors. both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific chemoreceptors. although humans commonly distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another, they work together to create the perception of flavor. a persons perception of flavor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages. odorants (odor molecules) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium, the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity (as illustrated in [link]). the olfactory epithelium is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm2 in humans. recall that sensory cells are neurons. an olfactory receptor, which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron, responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain. humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors, distributed among hundreds of different receptor types that respond to different odors. twelve million seems like a large number of receptors, but compare that to other animals: rabbits have about 100 million, most dogs have about 1 billion, and bloodhoundsdogs selectively bred for their sense of smellhave about 4 billion. the overall size of the olfactory epithelium also differs between species, with that of bloodhounds, for example, being many times larger than that of humans. olfactory neurons are bipolar neurons (neurons with two processes from the cell body). each neuron has a single dendrite buried in the olfactory epithelium, and extending from this dendrite are 5 to 20 receptor-laden, hair-like cilia that trap odorant molecules. the sensory receptors on the cilia are proteins, and it is the variations in their amino acid chains that make the receptors sensitive to different odorants. each olfactory sensory neuron has only one type of receptor on its cilia, and the receptors are specialized to detect specific odorants, so the bipolar neurons themselves are specialized. when an odorant binds with a receptor that recognizes it, the sensory neuron associated with the receptor is stimulated. olfactory stimulation is the only sensory information that directly reaches the cerebral cortex, whereas other sensations are relayed through the thalamus. pheromonesa pheromone is a chemical released by an animal that affects the behavior or physiology of animals of the same species. pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them, but pheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors. there are several different types of pheromones, which are released in urine or as glandular secretions. certain pheromones are attractants to potential mates, others are repellants to potential competitors of the same sex, and still others play roles in mother-infant attachment. some pheromones can also influence the timing of puberty, modify reproductive cycles, and even prevent embryonic implantation. while the roles of pheromones in many nonhuman species are important, pheromones have become less important in human behavior over evolutionary time compared to their importance to organisms with more limited behavioral repertoires. the vomeronasal organ (vno, or jacobsons organ) is a tubular, fluid-filled, olfactory organ present in many vertebrate animals that sits adjacent to the nasal cavity. it is very sensitive to pheromones and is connected to the nasal cavity by a duct. when molecules dissolve in the mucosa of the nasal cavity, they then enter the vno where the pheromone molecules among them bind with specialized pheromone receptors. upon exposure to pheromones from their own species or others, many animals, including cats, may display the flehmen response (shown in [link]), a curling of the upper lip that helps pheromone molecules enter the vno. pheromonal signals are sent, not to the main olfactory bulb, but to a different neural structure that projects directly to the amygdala (recall that the amygdala is a brain center important in emotional reactions, such as fear). the pheromonal signal then continues to areas of the hypothalamus that are key to reproductive physiology and behavior. while some scientists assert that the vno is apparently functionally vestigial in humans, even though there is a similar structure located near human nasal cavities, others are researching it as a possible functional system that may, for example, contribute to synchronization of menstrual cycles in women living in close proximity. detecting a taste (gustation) is fairly similar to detecting an odor (olfaction), given that both taste and smell rely on chemical receptors being stimulated by certain molecules. the primary organ of taste is the taste bud. a taste bud is a cluster of gustatory receptors (taste cells) that are located within the bumps on the tongue called papillae (singular: papilla) (illustrated in [link]). there are several structurally distinct papillae. filiform papillae, which are located across the tongue, are tactile, providing friction that helps the tongue move substances, and contain no taste cells. in contrast, fungiform papillae, which are located mainly on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, each contain one to eight taste buds and also have receptors for pressure and temperature. the large circumvallate papillae contain up to 100 taste buds and form a v near the posterior margin of the tongue. in addition to those two types of chemically and mechanically sensitive papillae are foliate papillaeleaf-like papillae located in parallel folds along the edges and toward the back of the tongue, as seen in the [link] micrograph. foliate papillae contain about 1,300 taste buds within their folds. finally, there are circumvallate papillae, which are wall-like papillae in the shape of an inverted v at the back of the tongue. each of these papillae is surrounded by a groove and contains about 250 taste buds. each taste buds taste cells are replaced every 10 to 14 days. these are elongated cells with hair-like processes called microvilli at the tips that extend into the taste bud pore (illustrate in [link]). food molecules (tastants) are dissolved in saliva, and they bind with and stimulate the receptors on the microvilli. the receptors for tastants are located across the outer portion and front of the tongue, outside of the middle area where the filiform papillae are most prominent. in humans, there are five primary tastes, and each taste has only one corresponding type of receptor. thus, like olfaction, each receptor is specific to its stimulus (tastant). transduction of the five tastes happens through different mechanisms that reflect the molecular composition of the tastant. a salty tastant (containing nacl) provides the sodium ions (na+) that enter the taste neurons and excite them directly. sour tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family. binding of an acid or other sour-tasting molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion (h+) concentrations in the taste neurons, thus depolarizing them. sweet, bitter, and umami tastants require a g-protein coupled receptor. these tastants bind to their respective receptors, thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with them. both tasting abilities and sense of smell change with age. in humans, the senses decline dramatically by age 50 and continue to decline. a child may find a food to be too spicy, whereas an elderly person may find the same food to be bland and unappetizing. 
olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin, unmyelinated axons. the olfactory bulb is composed of neural clusters called glomeruli, and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor, so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant. from glomeruli, olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus. recall that this is a different path from most other sensory information, which is sent directly to the thalamus before ending up in the cortex. olfactory signals also travel directly to the amygdala, thereafter reaching the hypothalamus, thalamus, and frontal cortex. the last structure that olfactory signals directly travel to is a cortical center in the temporal lobe structure important in spatial, autobiographical, declarative, and episodic memories. olfaction is finally processed by areas of the brain that deal with memory, emotions, reproduction, and thought. taste neurons project from taste cells in the tongue, esophagus, and palate to the medulla, in the brainstem. from the medulla, taste signals travel to the thalamus and then to the primary gustatory cortex. information from different regions of the tongue is segregated in the medulla, thalamus, and cortex. there are five primary tastes in humans: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. each taste has its own receptor type that responds only to that taste. tastants enter the body and are dissolved in saliva. taste cells are located within taste buds, which are found on three of the four types of papillae in the mouth. regarding olfaction, there are many thousands of odorants, but humans detect only about 10,000. like taste receptors, olfactory receptors are each responsive to only one odorant. odorants dissolve in nasal mucosa, where they excite their corresponding olfactory sensory cells. when these cells detect an odorant, they send their signals to the main olfactory bulb and then to other locations in the brain, including the olfactory cortex.","[('olfactory bulb', 'olfactory bulbs'), ('papilla', 'papillas'), ('bipolar neuron', 'bipolar neurons'), ('sensory system', 'sensory systems'), ('odor', 'odors'), ('umami', 'umamis'), ('taste bud', 'taste buds'), ('taste', 'tastes'), ('smell', 'smells'), ('odorant', 'odorants'), ('pheromone', 'pheromones'), ('salty', 'salties'), ('olfactory epithelium', 'olfactory epitheliums'), ('transduction', 'transductions'), ('olfaction', 'olfactions'), ('tastant', 'tastants'), ('glomerulu', 'glomeruluss', 'glomerulus'), ('reception', 'receptions'), ('sweet', 'sweets'), ('bitter', 'bitters'), ('gustation', 'gustations'), ('sense', 'senses'), ('smy', 'sours', 'sour')]"
188,stax-bio,36,Sensory Systems,4,m44760,Hearing and Vestibular Sensation,"audition, or hearing, is important to humans and to other animals for many different interactions. it enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger, such as an approaching predator, and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating. on the other hand, although it is physically linked to the auditory system, the vestibular system is not involved in hearing. instead, an animals vestibular system detects its own movement, both linear and angular acceleration and deceleration, and balance. auditory stimuli are sound waves, which are mechanical, pressure waves that move through a medium, such as air or water. there are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules to move in waves. the speed of sound waves differs, based on altitude, temperature, and medium, but at sea level and a temperature of 20 c (68 f), sound waves travel in the air at about 343 meters per second. as is true for all waves, there are four main characteristics of a sound wave: frequency, wavelength, period, and amplitude. frequency is the number of waves per unit of time, and in sound is heard as pitch. high-frequency (15.000hz) sounds are higher-pitched (short wavelength) than low-frequency (long wavelengths; 100hz) sounds. frequency is measured in cycles per second, and for sound, the most commonly used unit is hertz (hz), or cycles per second. most humans can perceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20,000 hz. women are typically better at hearing high frequencies, but everyones ability to hear high frequencies decreases with age. dogs detect up to about 40,000 hz; cats, 60,000 hz; bats, 100,000 hz; and dolphins 150,000 hz, and american shad (alosa sapidissima), a fish, can hear 180,000 hz. those frequencies above the human range are called ultrasound. amplitude, or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough, in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in [link]. the sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds. for sound, volume is measured in decibels (db). the softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point. humans speak normally at 60 decibels. in mammals, sound waves are collected by the external, cartilaginous part of the ear called the pinna, then travel through the auditory canal and cause vibration of the thin diaphragm called the tympanum or ear drum, the innermost part of the outer ear (illustrated in [link]). interior to the tympanum is the middle ear. the middle ear holds three small bones called the ossicles, which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear. the three ossicles are the malleus (also known as the hammer), the incus (the anvil), and stapes (the stirrup). the aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup. the three ossicles are unique to mammals, and each plays a role in hearing. the malleus attaches at three points to the interior surface of the tympanic membrane. the incus attaches the malleus to the stapes. in humans, the stapes is not long enough to reach the tympanum. if we did not have the malleus and the incus, then the vibrations of the tympanum would never reach the inner ear. these bones also function to collect force and amplify sounds. the ear ossicles are homologous to bones in a fish mouth: the bones that support gills in fish are thought to be adapted for use in the vertebrate ear over evolutionary time. many animals (frogs, reptiles, and birds, for example) use the stapes of the middle ear to transmit vibrations to the middle ear. vibrating objects, such as vocal cords, create sound waves or pressure waves in the air. when these pressure waves reach the ear, the ear transduces this mechanical stimulus (pressure wave) into a nerve impulse (electrical signal) that the brain perceives as sound. the pressure waves strike the tympanum, causing it to vibrate. the mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear. the stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the oval window, which is the outermost structure of the inner ear. the structures of the inner ear are found in the labyrinth, a bony, hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear. here, the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea. the vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid (perilymph) inside the cochlea. the cochlea is a whorled structure, like the shell of a snail, and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal (as illustrated in [link]). inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea, curling toward the cochleas center. the mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length, such that it is thicker, tauter, and narrower at the outside of the whorl (where the cochlea is largest), and thinner, floppier, and broader toward the apex, or center, of the whorl (where the cochlea is smallest). different regions of the basilar membrane vibrate according to the frequency of the sound wave conducted through the fluid in the cochlea. for these reasons, the fluid-filled cochlea detects different wave frequencies (pitches) at different regions of the membrane. when the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar membrane, it flexes back and forth in a wave-like fashion. above the basilar membrane is the tectorial membrane. the site of transduction is in the organ of corti (spiral organ). it is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil, with their exposed short, hair-like stereocilia contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them. the inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row, numbering approximately 3,500. the stereocilia from inner hair cells extend into small dimples on the tectorial membranes lower surface. the outer hair cells are arranged in three or four rows. they number approximately 12,000, and they function to fine tune incoming sound waves. the longer stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial membrane. all of the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors, and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening a gated ion channel (refer to [link]). as a result, the hair cell membrane is depolarized, and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear nerve. intensity (volume) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated. the hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way. the basilar membrane vibrates in different regions, according to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it. likewise, the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive to a specific frequency of sound waves. hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies, but they require stimulation of greater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range. the difference in response frequency between adjacent inner hair cells is about 0.2 percent. compare that to adjacent piano strings, which are about six percent different. place theory, which is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear, states that high frequency sounds selectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port (the oval window). lower frequencies travel farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane. the basic pitch-determining mechanism is based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated. the place theory is the first step toward an understanding of pitch perception. considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear, it is thought that there must be some auditory sharpening mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution. when sound waves produce fluid waves inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane flexes, bending the stereocilia that attach to the tectorial membrane. their bending results in action potentials in the hair cells, and auditory information travels along the neural endings of the bipolar neurons of the hair cells (collectively, the auditory nerve) to the brain. when the hairs bend, they release an excitatory neurotransmitter at a synapse with a sensory neuron, which then conducts action potentials to the central nervous system. the cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve sends information on hearing. the auditory system is very refined, and there is some modulation or sharpening built in. the brain can send signals back to the cochlea, resulting in a change of length in the outer hair cells, sharpening or dampening the hair cells response to certain frequencies. the inner hair cells are most important for conveying auditory information to the brain. about 90 percent of the afferent neurons carry information from inner hair cells, with each hair cell synapsing with 10 or so neurons. outer hair cells connect to only 10 percent of the afferent neurons, and each afferent neuron innervates many hair cells. the afferent, bipolar neurons that convey auditory information travel from the cochlea to the medulla, through the pons and midbrain in the brainstem, finally reaching the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. the stimuli associated with the vestibular system are linear acceleration (gravity) and angular acceleration and deceleration. gravity, acceleration, and deceleration are detected by evaluating the inertia on receptive cells in the vestibular system. gravity is detected through head position. angular acceleration and deceleration are expressed through turning or tilting of the head. the vestibular system has some similarities with the auditory system. it utilizes hair cells just like the auditory system, but it excites them in different ways. there are five vestibular receptor organs in the inner ear: the utricle, the saccule, and three semicircular canals. together, they make up whats known as the vestibular labyrinth that is shown in [link]. the utricle and saccule respond to acceleration in a straight line, such as gravity. the roughly 30,000 hair cells in the utricle and 16,000 hair cells in the saccule lie below a gelatinous layer, with their stereocilia projecting into the gelatin. embedded in this gelatin are calcium carbonate crystalslike tiny rocks. when the head is tilted, the crystals continue to be pulled straight down by gravity, but the new angle of the head causes the gelatin to shift, thereby bending the stereocilia. the bending of the stereocilia stimulates the neurons, and they signal to the brain that the head is tilted, allowing the maintenance of balance. it is the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve that deals with balance. the fluid-filled semicircular canals are tubular loops set at oblique angles. they are arranged in three spatial planes. the base of each canal has a swelling that contains a cluster of hair cells. the hairs project into a gelatinous cap called the cupula and monitor angular acceleration and deceleration from rotation. they would be stimulated by driving your car around a corner, turning your head, or falling forward. one canal lies horizontally, while the other two lie at about 45 degree angles to the horizontal axis, as illustrated in [link]. when the brain processes input from all three canals together, it can detect angular acceleration or deceleration in three dimensions. when the head turns, the fluid in the canals shifts, thereby bending stereocilia and sending signals to the brain. upon cessation accelerating or deceleratingor just movingthe movement of the fluid within the canals slows or stops. for example, imagine holding a glass of water. when moving forward, water may splash backwards onto the hand, and when motion has stopped, water may splash forward onto the fingers. while in motion, the water settles in the glass and does not splash. note that the canals are not sensitive to velocity itself, but to changes in velocity, so moving forward at 60mph with your eyes closed would not give the sensation of movement, but suddenly accelerating or braking would stimulate the receptors. hair cells from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals also communicate through bipolar neurons to the cochlear nucleus in the medulla. cochlear neurons send descending projections to the spinal cord and ascending projections to the pons, thalamus, and cerebellum. connections to the cerebellum are important for coordinated movements. there are also projections to the temporal cortex, which account for feelings of dizziness; projections to autonomic nervous system areas in the brainstem, which account for motion sickness; and projections to the primary somatosensory cortex, which monitors subjective measurements of the external world and self-movement. people with lesions in the vestibular area of the somatosensory cortex see vertical objects in the world as being tilted. finally, the vestibular signals project to certain optic muscles to coordinate eye and head movements. audition is important for territory defense, predation, predator defense, and communal exchanges. the vestibular system, which is not auditory, detects linear acceleration and angular acceleration and deceleration. both the auditory system and vestibular system use hair cells as their receptors. auditory stimuli are sound waves. the sound wave energy reaches the outer ear (pinna, canal, tympanum), and vibrations of the tympanum send the energy to the middle ear. the middle ear bones shift and the stapes transfers mechanical energy to the oval window of the fluid-filled inner ear cochlea. once in the cochlea, the energy causes the basilar membrane to flex, thereby bending the stereocilia on receptor hair cells. this activates the receptors, which send their auditory neural signals to the brain. the vestibular system has five parts that work together to provide the sense of direction, thus helping to maintain balance. the utricle and saccule measure head orientation: their calcium carbonate crystals shift when the head is tilted, thereby activating hair cells. the semicircular canals work similarly, such that when the head is turned, the fluid in the canals bends stereocilia on hair cells. the vestibular hair cells also send signals to the thalamus and to somatosensory cortex, but also to the cerebellum, the structure above the brainstem that plays a large role in timing and coordination of movement.","[('ultrasound', 'ultrasounds'), ('malleu', 'malleuss', 'malleus'), ('sound reception', 'sound receptions'), ('sound transduction', 'sound transductions'), ('sensory

189,stax-bio,36,Sensory Systems,5,m44761,Vision,"vision is the ability to detect light patterns from the outside environment and interpret them into images. animals are bombarded with sensory information, and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic. fortunately, the visual systems of species have evolved to attend to the most-important stimuli. the importance of vision to humans is further substantiated by the fact that about one-third of the human cerebral cortex is dedicated to analyzing and perceiving visual information. as with auditory stimuli, light travels in waves. the compression waves that compose sound must travel in a mediuma gas, a liquid, or a solid. in contrast, light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no medium; light can travel in a vacuum ([link]). the behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the fundamental unit of lighta packet of electromagnetic radiation called a photon. a glance at the electromagnetic spectrum shows that visible light for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum, which includes radiation that we cannot see as light because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light. certain variables are important when discussing perception of light. wavelength (which varies inversely with frequency) manifests itself as hue. light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths (and is lower frequency), while light at the violet end has shorter wavelengths (and is higher frequency). the wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers (nm); one nanometer is one billionth of a meter. humans perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm. some other animals, though, can detect wavelengths outside of the human range. for example, bees see near-ultraviolet light in order to locate nectar guides on flowers, and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light (heat that prey gives off). wave amplitude is perceived as luminous intensity, or brightness. the standard unit of intensity of light is the candela, which is approximately the luminous intensity of a one common candle. light waves travel 299,792 km per second in a vacuum, (and somewhat slower in various media such as air and water), and those waves arrive at the eye as long (red), medium (green), and short (blue) waves. what is termed white light is light that is perceived as white by the human eye. this effect is produced by light that stimulates equally the color receptors in the human eye. the apparent color of an object is the color (or colors) that the object reflects. thus a red object reflects the red wavelengths in mixed (white) light and absorbs all other wavelengths of light.  the photoreceptive cells of the eye, where transduction of light to nervous impulses occurs, are located in the retina (shown in [link]) on the inner surface of the back of the eye. but light does not impinge on the retina unaltered. it passes through other layers that process it so that it can be interpreted by the retina ([link]b). the cornea, the front transparent layer of the eye, and the crystalline lens, a transparent convex structure behind the cornea, both refract (bend) light to focus the image on the retina. the iris, which is conspicuous as the colored part of the eye, is a circular muscular ring lying between the lens and cornea that regulates the amount of light entering the eye. in conditions of high ambient light, the iris contracts, reducing the size of the pupil at its center. in conditions of low light, the iris relaxes and the pupil enlarges. the main function of the lens is to focus light on the retina and fovea centralis. the lens is dynamic, focusing and re-focusing light as the eye rests on near and far objects in the visual field. the lens is operated by muscles that stretch it flat or allow it to thicken, changing the focal length of light coming through it to focus it sharply on the retina. with age comes the loss of the flexibility of the lens, and a form of farsightedness called presbyopia results. presbyopia occurs because the image focuses behind the retina. presbyopia is a deficit similar to a different type of farsightedness called hyperopia caused by an eyeball that is too short. for both defects, images in the distance are clear but images nearby are blurry. myopia (nearsightedness) occurs when an eyeball is elongated and the image focus falls in front of the retina. in this case, images in the distance are blurry but images nearby are clear. there are two types of photoreceptors in the retina: rods and cones, named for their general appearance as illustrated in [link]. rods are strongly photosensitive and are located in the outer edges of the retina. they detect dim light and are used primarily for peripheral and nighttime vision. cones are weakly photosensitive and are located near the center of the retina. they respond to bright light, and their primary role is in daytime, color vision. the fovea is the region in the center back of the eye that is responsible for acute vision. the fovea has a high density of cones. when you bring your gaze to an object to examine it intently in bright light, the eyes orient so that the objects image falls on the fovea. however, when looking at a star in the night sky or other object in dim light, the object can be better viewed by the peripheral vision because it is the rods at the edges of the retina, rather than the cones at the center, that operate better in low light. in humans, cones far outnumber rods in the fovea. the rods and cones are the site of transduction of light to a neural signal. both rods and cones contain photopigments. in vertebrates, the main photopigment, rhodopsin, has two main parts  [link]): an opsin, which is a membrane protein (in the form of a cluster of -helices that span the membrane), and retinala molecule that absorbs light. when light hits a photoreceptor, it causes a shape change in the retinal, altering its structure from a bent (cis) form of the molecule to its linear (trans) isomer. this isomerization of retinal activates the rhodopsin, starting a cascade of events that ends with the closing of na+ channels in the membrane of the photoreceptor. thus, unlike most other sensory neurons (which become depolarized by exposure to a stimulus) visual receptors become hyperpolarized and thus driven away from threshold ([link]). there are three types of cones (with different photopsins), and they differ in the wavelength to which they are most responsive, as shown in [link]. some cones are maximally responsive to short light waves of 420 nm, so they are called s cones (s for short); others respond maximally to waves of 530 nm (m cones, for medium); a third group responds maximally to light of longer wavelengths, at 560 nm (l, or long cones). with only one type of cone, color vision would not be possible, and a two-cone (dichromatic) system has limitations. primates use a three-cone (trichromatic) system, resulting in full color vision. the color we perceive is a result of the ratio of activity of our three types of cones. the colors of the visual spectrum, running from long-wavelength light to short, are red (700 nm), orange (600 nm), yellow (565 nm), green (497 nm), blue (470 nm), indigo (450 nm), and violet (425 nm). humans have very sensitive perception of color and can distinguish about 500 levels of brightness, 200 different hues, and 20 steps of saturation, or about 2 million distinct colors. visual signals leave the cones and rods, travel to the bipolar cells, and then to ganglion cells. a large degree of processing of visual information occurs in the retina itself, before visual information is sent to the brain. photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo tonic activity. that is, they are always slightly active even when not stimulated by light. in neurons that exhibit tonic activity, the absence of stimuli maintains a firing rate at a baseline; while some stimuli increase firing rate from the baseline, and other stimuli decrease firing rate. in the absence of light, the bipolar neurons that connect rods and cones to ganglion cells are continuously and actively inhibited by the rods and cones. exposure of the retina to light hyperpolarizes the rods and cones and removes their inhibition of bipolar cells. the now active bipolar cells in turn stimulate the ganglion cells, which send action potentials along their axons (which leave the eye as the optic nerve). thus, the visual system relies on change in retinal activity, rather than the absence or presence of activity, to encode visual signals for the brain. sometimes horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptors and to several bipolar cells. when a rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell, the horizontal cell inhibits more distant photoreceptors and bipolar cells, creating lateral inhibition. this inhibition sharpens edges and enhances contrast in the images by making regions receiving light appear lighter and dark surroundings appear darker. amacrine cells can distribute information from one bipolar cell to many ganglion cells. you can demonstrate this using an easy demonstration to trick your retina and brain about the colors you are observing in your visual field. look fixedly at [link] for about 45 seconds. then quickly shift your gaze to a sheet of blank white paper or a white wall. you should see an afterimage of the norwegian flag in its correct colors. at this point, close your eyes for a moment, then reopen them, looking again at the white paper or wall; the afterimage of the flag should continue to appear as red, white, and blue. what causes this? according to an explanation called opponent process theory, as you gazed fixedly at the green, black, and yellow flag, your retinal ganglion cells that respond positively to green, black, and yellow increased their firing dramatically. when you shifted your gaze to the neutral white ground, these ganglion cells abruptly decreased their activity and the brain interpreted this abrupt downshift as if the ganglion cells were responding now to their opponent colors: red, white, and blue, respectively, in the visual field. once the ganglion cells return to their baseline activity state, the false perception of color will disappear. the myelinated axons of ganglion cells make up the optic nerves. within the nerves, different axons carry different qualities of the visual signal. some axons constitute the magnocellular (big cell) pathway, which carries information about form, movement, depth, and differences in brightness. other axons constitute the parvocellular (small cell) pathway, which carries information on color and fine detail. some visual information projects directly back into the brain, while other information crosses to the opposite side of the brain. this crossing of optical pathways produces the distinctive optic chiasma (greek, for crossing) found at the base of the brain and allows us to coordinate information from both eyes. once in the brain, visual information is processed in several places, and its routes reflect the complexity and importance of visual information to humans and other animals. one route takes the signals to the thalamus, which serves as the routing station for all incoming sensory impulses except olfaction. in the thalamus, the magnocellular and parvocellular distinctions remain intact, and there are different layers of the thalamus dedicated to each. when visual signals leave the thalamus, they travel to the primary visual cortex at the rear of the brain. from the visual cortex, the visual signals travel in two directions. one stream that projects to the parietal lobe, in the side of the brain, carries magnocellular (where) information. a second stream projects to the temporal lobe and carries both magnocellular (where) and parvocellular (what) information. another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the superior colliculus in the midbrain, where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information. finally, there is the pathway from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) of the hypothalamus. the scn is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the bodys internal clock, which controls our circadian (day-long) cycle. the scn sends information to the pineal gland, which is important in sleep/wake patterns and annual cycles. vision is the only photo responsive sense. visible light travels in waves and is a very small slice of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum. light waves differ based on their frequency (wavelength = hue) and amplitude (intensity = brightness). in the vertebrate retina, there are two types of light receptors (photoreceptors): cones and rods. cones, which are the source of color vision, exist in three formsl, m, and sand they are differentially sensitive to different wavelengths. cones are located in the retina, along with the dim-light, achromatic receptors (rods). cones are found in the fovea, the central region of the retina, whereas rods are found in the peripheral regions of the retina. visual signals travel from the eye over the axons of retinal ganglion cells, which make up the optic nerves. ganglion cells come in several versions. some ganglion cell axons carry information on form, movement, depth, and brightness, while other axons carry information on color and fine detail. visual information is sent to the superior colliculi in the midbrain, where coordination of eye movements and integration of auditory information takes place. visual information is also sent to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) of the hypothalamus, which plays a role in the circadian cycle.","[('light transduction', 'light transductions'), ('iri', 'irides',

191,stax-bio,37,The Endocrine System,1,m44766,Types of Hormones,"maintaining homeostasis within the body requires the coordination of many different systems and organs. communication between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body, occurs through the release of chemicals called hormones. hormones are released into body fluids (usually blood) that carry these chemicals to their target cells. at the target cells, which are cells that have a receptor for a signal or ligand from a signal cell, the hormones elicit a response. the cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones make up the endocrine system. examples of glands of the endocrine system include the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses to stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates. although there are many different hormones in the human body, they can be divided into three classes based on their chemical structure: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide (peptide and proteins) hormones. one of the key distinguishing features of lipid-derived hormones is that they can diffuse across plasma membranes whereas the amino acid-derived and peptide hormones cannot. most lipid hormones are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it, as illustrated in [link]. the primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones. chemically, these hormones are usually ketones or alcohols; their chemical names will end in -ol for alcohols or -one for ketones. examples of steroid hormones include estradiol, which is an estrogen, or female sex hormone,  and testosterone, which is an androgen, or male sex hormone. these two hormones  are released by the female and male reproductive organs, respectively. other steroid hormones include  aldosterone and cortisol, which are released by the adrenal glands along with some other types of androgens. steroid hormones are insoluble in water, and they are transported by transport proteins in blood. as a result, they remain in circulation longer than peptide hormones. for example, cortisol has a half-life of 60 to 90 minutes, while epinephrine, an amino acid derived-hormone, has a half-life of approximately one minute. the amino acid-derived hormones are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, shown in [link]. if a hormone is amino acid-derived, its chemical name will end in -ine. examples of amino acid-derived hormones include epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are synthesized in the medulla of the adrenal glands, and thyroxine, which is produced by the thyroid gland. the pineal gland in the brain makes and secretes melatonin which regulates sleep cycles. the structure of peptide hormones is that of a polypeptide chain (chain of amino acids). the peptide hormones include molecules that are short polypeptide chains, such as antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin produced in the brain and released into the blood in the posterior pituitary gland. this class also includes small proteins, like growth hormones produced by the pituitary, and large glycoproteins such as follicle-stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary. [link] illustrates these peptide hormones. secreted peptides like insulin are stored within vesicles in the cells that synthesize them. they are then released in response to stimuli such as high blood glucose levels in the case of insulin. amino acid-derived and polypeptide hormones are water-soluble and insoluble in lipids. these hormones cannot pass through plasma membranes of cells; therefore, their receptors are found on the surface of the target cells. endocrinologistan endocrinologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine glands, hormone systems, and glucose and lipid metabolic pathways. an endocrine surgeon specializes in the surgical treatment of endocrine diseases and glands. some of the diseases that are managed by endocrinologists: disorders of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus), disorders of the pituitary (gigantism, acromegaly, and pituitary dwarfism), disorders of the thyroid gland (goiter and graves disease), and disorders of the adrenal glands (cushings disease and addisons disease). endocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive use of laboratory tests. many endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine organ functioning. blood samples are then drawn to determine the effect of stimulating or suppressing an endocrine organ on the production of hormones. for example, to diagnose diabetes mellitus, patients are required to fast for 12 to 24 hours. they are then given a sugary drink, which stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin to decrease blood glucose levels. a blood sample is taken one to two hours after the sugar drink is consumed. if the pancreas is functioning properly, the blood glucose level will be within a normal range. another example is the a1c test, which can be performed during blood screening. the a1c test measures average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months by examining how well the blood glucose is being managed over a long time. once a disease has been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes and/or medications to treat the disease. some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise, weight loss, and a healthy diet; in other cases, medications may be required to enhance insulin release. if the disease cannot be controlled by these means, the endocrinologist may prescribe insulin injections. in addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also be involved in primary research and development activities. for example, ongoing islet transplant research is investigating how healthy pancreas islet cells may be transplanted into diabetic patients. successful islet transplants may allow patients to stop taking insulin injections. there are three basic types of hormones: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide. lipid-derived hormones are structurally similar to cholesterol and include steroid hormones such as estradiol and testosterone. amino acid-derived hormones are relatively small molecules and include the adrenal hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. peptide hormones are polypeptide chains or proteins and include the pituitary hormones, antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin), and oxytocin.","[('homeostasi', 'homeostases', 'homeostasis'), ('exocrine system', 'exocrine systems'), ('peptide hormone', 'peptide hormones'), ('endocrine system', 'endocrine systems'), ('lipid derived hormone', 'lipid derived hormones'), ('endocrinologist', 'endocrinologists'), ('hormone', 'hormones'), ('amino acid derived hormone', 'amino acid derived hormones', 'amino acids derived hormone', 'amino acids derived hormones', 'aminoes acid derived hormone', 'aminoes acid derived hormones', 'aminoes acids derived hormone', 'aminoes acids derived hormones'), ('endocrine', 'endocrines')]"
192,stax-bio,37,The Endocrine System,2,m44768,How Hormones Work,"hormones mediate changes in target cells by binding to specific hormone receptors. in this way, even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors. receptors for a specific hormone may be found on many different cells or may be limited to a small number of specialized cells. for example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic activity throughout the body. cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of hormones. the number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cells sensitivity to that hormone, and the resulting cellular response. additionally, the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time, resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity. in up-regulation, the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels, making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity. when the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels, called down-regulation, cellular activity is reduced. receptor binding alters cellular activity and results in an increase or decrease in normal body processes. depending on the location of the protein receptor on the target cell and the chemical structure of the hormone, hormones can mediate changes directly by binding to intracellular hormone receptors and modulating gene transcription, or indirectly by binding to cell surface receptors and stimulating signaling pathways. lipid-derived (soluble) hormones such as steroid hormones diffuse across the membranes of the endocrine cell. once outside the cell, they bind to transport proteins that keep them soluble in the bloodstream. at the target cell, the hormones are released from the carrier protein and diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane of cells. the steroid hormones pass through the plasma membrane of a target cell and adhere to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. the cell signaling pathways induced by the steroid hormones regulate specific genes on the cell's dna. the hormones and receptor complex act as transcription regulators by increasing or decreasing the synthesis of mrna molecules of specific genes. this, in turn, determines the amount of corresponding protein that is synthesized by altering gene expression. this protein can be used either to change the structure of the cell or to produce enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions. in this way, the steroid hormone regulates specific cell processes as illustrated in [link]. other lipid-soluble hormones that are not steroid hormones, such as vitamin d and thyroxine, have receptors located in the nucleus. the hormones diffuse across both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope, then bind to receptors in the nucleus. the hormone-receptor complex stimulates transcription of specific genes. amino acid derived hormones and polypeptide hormones are not lipid-derived (lipid-soluble) and therefore cannot diffuse through the plasma membrane of cells. lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, via plasma membrane hormone receptors. unlike steroid hormones, lipid insoluble hormones do not directly affect the target cell because they cannot enter the cell and act directly on dna. binding of these hormones to a cell surface receptor results in activation of a signaling pathway; this triggers intracellular activity and carries out the specific effects associated with the hormone. in this way, nothing passes through the cell membrane; the hormone that binds at the surface remains at the surface of the cell while the intracellular product remains inside the cell. the hormone that initiates the signaling pathway is called a first messenger, which activates a second messenger in the cytoplasm, as illustrated in [link]. one very important second messenger is cyclic amp (camp). when a hormone binds to its membrane receptor, a g-protein that is associated with the receptor is activated; g-proteins are proteins separate from receptors that are found in the cell membrane. when a hormone is not bound to the receptor, the g-protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine diphosphate, or gdp. when a hormone binds to the receptor, the g-protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate, or gtp, in place of gdp. after binding, gtp is hydrolysed by the g-protein into gdp and becomes inactive. the activated g-protein in turn activates a membrane-bound enzyme called adenylyl cyclase. adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of atp to camp. camp, in turn, activates a group of proteins called protein kinases, which transfer a phosphate group from atp to a substrate molecule in a process called phosphorylation. the phosphorylation of a substrate molecule changes its structural orientation, thereby activating it. these activated molecules can then mediate changes in cellular processes. the effect of a hormone is amplified as the signaling pathway progresses. the binding of a hormone at a single receptor causes the activation of many g-proteins, which activates adenylyl cyclase. each molecule of adenylyl cyclase then triggers the formation of many molecules of camp. further amplification occurs as protein kinases, once activated by camp, can catalyze many reactions. in this way, a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular product. to stop hormone activity, camp is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme phosphodiesterase, or pde. pde is always present in the cell and breaks down camp to control hormone activity, preventing overproduction of cellular products. the specific response of a cell to a lipid insoluble hormone depends on the type of receptors that are present on the cell membrane and the substrate molecules present in the cell cytoplasm. cellular responses to hormone binding of a receptor include altering membrane permeability and metabolic pathways, stimulating synthesis of proteins and enzymes, and activating hormone release. hormones cause cellular changes by binding to receptors on target cells. the number of receptors on a target cell can increase or decrease in response to hormone activity. hormones can affect cells directly through intracellular hormone receptors or indirectly through plasma membrane hormone receptors. lipid-derived (soluble) hormones can enter the cell by diffusing across the plasma membrane and binding to dna to regulate gene transcription and to change the cells activities by inducing production of proteins that affect, in general, the long-term structure and function of the cell. lipid insoluble hormones bind to receptors on the plasma membrane surface and trigger a signaling pathway to change the cells activities by inducing production of various cell products that affect the cell in the short-term. the hormone is called a first messenger and the cellular component is called a second messenger. g-proteins activate the second messenger (cyclic amp), triggering the cellular response. response to hormone binding is amplified as the signaling pathway progresses. cellular responses to hormones include the production of proteins and enzymes and altered membrane permeability.","[('hormone receptor', 'hormone receptors'), ('down-regulation', 'down-regulations'), ('up-regulation', 'up-regulations'), ('phosphodiesterase', 'phosphodiesterases'), ('hormone', 'hormones'), ('adenylate cyclase', 'adenylate cyclases'), ('endocrine system', 'endocrine systems'), ('endocrine', 'endocrines'), ('intracellular hormone receptor', 'intracellular hormone receptors', 'intracellular hormones receptor', 'intracellular hormones receptors'), ('plasma membrane hormone receptor', 'plasma membrane hormone receptors', 'plasma membrane hormones receptor', 'plasma membrane hormones receptors', 'plasma membranes hormone receptor', 'plasma membranes hormone receptors', 'plasma membranes hormones receptor', 'plasma membranes hormones receptors', 'plasmas membrane hormone receptor', 'plasmas membrane hormone receptors', 'plasmas membrane hormones receptor', 'plasmas membrane hormones receptors', 'plasmas membranes hormone receptor', 'plasmas membranes hormone receptors', 'plasmas membranes hormones receptor', 'plasmas membranes hormones receptors'), ('second messenger', 'second messengers'), ('first messenger', 'first messengers'), ('g-protein', 'g-proteins')]"
193,stax-bio,37,The Endocrine System,3,m44777,Regulation of Body Processes,"hormones have a wide range of effects and modulate many different body processes. the key regulatory processes that will be examined here are those affecting the excretory system, the reproductive system, metabolism, blood calcium concentrations, growth, and the stress response. maintaining a proper water balance in the body is important to avoid dehydration or over-hydration (hyponatremia). the water concentration of the body is monitored by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which detect the concentration of electrolytes in the extracellular fluid. the concentration of electrolytes in the blood rises when there is water loss caused by excessive perspiration, inadequate water intake, or low blood volume due to blood loss. an increase in blood electrolyte levels results in a neuronal signal being sent from the osmoreceptors in hypothalamic nuclei. the pituitary gland has two components: anterior and posterior. the anterior pituitary is composed of glandular cells that secrete protein hormones. the posterior pituitary is an extension of the hypothalamus. it is composed largely of neurons that are continuous with the hypothalamus. the hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (adh), which is transported to and released from the posterior pituitary gland. the principal action of adh is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the kidneys. as adh (which is also known as vasopressin) causes direct water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, salts and wastes are concentrated in what will eventually be excreted as urine. the hypothalamus controls the mechanisms of adh secretion, either by regulating blood volume or the concentration of water in the blood. dehydration or physiological stress can cause an increase of osmolarity above 300 mosm/l, which in turn, raises adh secretion and water will be retained, causing an increase in blood pressure. adh travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys. once at the kidneys, adh changes the kidneys to become more permeable to water by temporarily inserting water channels, aquaporins, into the kidney tubules. water moves out of the kidney tubules through the aquaporins, reducing urine volume. the water is reabsorbed into the capillaries lowering blood osmolarity back toward normal. as blood osmolarity decreases, a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus, and adh secretion is reduced. adh release can be reduced by certain substances, including alcohol, which can cause increased urine production and dehydration. chronic underproduction of adh or a mutation in the adh receptor results in diabetes insipidus. if the posterior pituitary does not release enough adh, water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine. this causes increased thirst, but water taken in is lost again and must be continually consumed. if the condition is not severe, dehydration may not occur, but severe cases can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration. another hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte concentrations in extracellular fluids is aldosterone, a steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex. in contrast to adh, which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain proper water balance, aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing na+ reabsorption and k+ secretion from extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules. because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the concentrations of minerals na+ and k+, aldosterone is referred to as a mineralocorticoid, a corticosteroid that affects ion and water balance. aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels, blood volume, or blood pressure, or an increase in blood potassium levels. it also prevents the loss of na+ from sweat, saliva, and gastric juice. the reabsorption of na+ also results in the osmotic reabsorption of water, which alters blood volume and blood pressure. aldosterone production can be stimulated by low blood pressure, which triggers a sequence of chemical release, as illustrated in [link]. when blood pressure drops, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) is activated. cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which regulates the functions of the nephrons of the kidney, detect this and release renin. renin, an enzyme, circulates in the blood and reacts with a plasma protein produced by the liver called angiotensinogen. when angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin, it produces angiotensin i, which is then converted into angiotensin ii in the lungs. angiotensin ii functions as a hormone and then causes the release of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, resulting in increased na+ reabsorption, water retention, and an increase in blood pressure. angiotensin ii in addition to being a potent vasoconstrictor also causes an increase in adh and increased thirst, both of which help to raise blood pressure. regulation of the reproductive system is a process that requires the action of hormones from the pituitary gland, the adrenal cortex, and the gonads. during puberty in both males and females, the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh), which stimulates the production and release of follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh) from the anterior pituitary gland. these hormones regulate the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females) and therefore are called gonadotropins. in both males and females, fsh stimulates gamete production and lh stimulates production of hormones by the gonads. an increase in gonad hormone levels inhibits gnrh production through a negative feedback loop. in males, fsh stimulates the maturation of sperm cells. fsh production is inhibited by the hormone inhibin, which is released by the testes. lh stimulates production of the sex hormones (androgens) by the interstitial cells of the testes and therefore is also called interstitial cell-stimulating hormone. the most widely known androgen in males is testosterone. testosterone promotes the production of sperm and masculine characteristics. the adrenal cortex also produces small amounts of testosterone precursor, although the role of this additional hormone production is not fully understood. the dangers of synthetic hormones some athletes attempt to boost their performance by using artificial hormones that enhance muscle performance. anabolic steroids, a form of the male sex hormone testosterone, are one of the most widely known performance-enhancing drugs. steroids are used to help build muscle mass. other hormones that are used to enhance athletic performance include erythropoietin, which triggers the production of red blood cells, and human growth hormone, which can help in building muscle mass. most performance enhancing drugs are illegal for non-medical purposes. they are also banned by national and international governing bodies including the international olympic committee, the u.s. olympic committee, the national collegiate athletic association, the major league baseball, and the national football league. the side effects of synthetic hormones are often significant and non-reversible, and in some cases, fatal. androgens produce several complications such as liver dysfunctions and liver tumors, prostate gland enlargement, difficulty urinating, premature closure of epiphyseal cartilages, testicular atrophy, infertility, and immune system depression. the physiological strain caused by these substances is often greater than what the body can handle, leading to unpredictable and dangerous effects and linking their use to heart attacks, strokes, and impaired cardiac function. in females, fsh stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. follicle cells produce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits fsh production. lh also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries, as illustrated in [link]. estradiol and progesterone are steroid hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy. estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both estradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle. in addition to producing fsh and lh, the anterior portion of the pituitary gland also produces the hormone prolactin (prl) in females. prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth. prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin-releasing hormone (prh) and prolactin-inhibiting hormone (pih), which is now known to be dopamine. prh stimulates the release of prolactin and pih inhibits it. the posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth. the uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks. stretching of tissues in the uterus and cervix stimulates oxytocin release during childbirth. contractions increase in intensity as blood levels of oxytocin rise via a positive feedback mechanism until the birth is complete. oxytocin also stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells around the milk-producing mammary glands. as these cells contract, milk is forced from the secretory alveoli into milk ducts and is ejected from the breasts in milk ejection (let-down) reflex. oxytocin release is stimulated by the suckling of an infant, which triggers the synthesis of oxytocin in the hypothalamus and its release into circulation at the posterior pituitary. blood glucose levels vary widely over the course of a day as periods of food consumption alternate with periods of fasting. insulin and glucagon are the two hormones primarily responsible for maintaining homeostasis of blood glucose levels. additional regulation is mediated by the thyroid hormones. cells of the body require nutrients in order to function, and these nutrients are obtained through feeding. in order to manage nutrient intake, storing excess intake and utilizing reserves when necessary, the body uses hormones to moderate energy stores. insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, which are stimulated to release insulin as blood glucose levels rise (for example, after a meal is consumed). insulin lowers blood glucose levels by enhancing the rate of glucose uptake and utilization by target cells, which use glucose for atp production. it also stimulates the liver to convert glucose to glycogen, which is then stored by cells for later use. insulin also increases glucose transport into certain cells, such as muscle cells and the liver. this results from an insulin-mediated increase in the number of glucose transporter proteins in cell membranes, which remove glucose from circulation by facilitated diffusion. as insulin binds to its target cell via insulin receptors and signal transduction, it triggers the cell to incorporate glucose transport proteins into its membrane. this allows glucose to enter the cell, where it can be used as an energy source. however, this does not occur in all cells: some cells, including those in the kidneys and brain, can access glucose without the use of insulin. insulin also stimulates the conversion of glucose to fat in adipocytes and the synthesis of proteins. these actions mediated by insulin cause blood glucose concentrations to fall, called a hypoglycemic low sugar effect, which inhibits further insulin release from beta cells through a negative feedback loop. this animation describe the role of insulin and the pancreas in diabetes.

 impaired insulin function can lead to a condition called diabetes mellitus, the main symptoms of which are illustrated in [link]. this can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas, or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin. this prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells, causing high levels of blood glucose, or hyperglycemia (high sugar). high blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine, resulting in glucose being lost in urine. high glucose levels also result in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys, causing high amounts of urine to be produced; this may result in dehydration. over time, high blood glucose levels can cause nerve damage to the eyes and peripheral body tissues, as well as damage to the kidneys and cardiovascular system. oversecretion of insulin can cause hypoglycemia, low blood glucose levels. this causes insufficient glucose availability to cells, often leading to muscle weakness, and can sometimes cause unconsciousness or death if left untreated. when blood glucose levels decline below normal levels, for example between meals or when glucose is utilized rapidly during exercise, the hormone glucagon is released from the alpha cells of the pancreas. glucagon raises blood glucose levels, eliciting what is called a hyperglycemic effect, by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in skeletal muscle cells and liver cells in a process called glycogenolysis. glucose can then be utilized as energy by muscle cells and released into circulation by the liver cells. glucagon also stimulates absorption of amino acids from the blood by the liver, which then converts them to glucose. this process of glucose synthesis is called gluconeogenesis. glucagon also stimulates adipose cells to release fatty acids into the blood. these actions mediated by glucagon result in an increase in blood glucose levels to normal homeostatic levels. rising blood glucose levels inhibit further glucagon release by the pancreas via a negative feedback mechanism. in this way, insulin and glucagon work together to maintain homeostatic glucose levels, as shown in [link]. the basal metabolic rate, which is the amount of calories required by the body at rest, is determined by two hormones produced by the thyroid gland: thyroxine, also known as tetraiodothyronine or t4, and triiodothyronine, also known as t3. these hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain, uterus, testes, blood cells, and spleen. they are transported across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to receptors on the mitochondria resulting in increased atp production. in the nucleus, t3 and t4 activate genes involved in energy production and glucose oxidation. this results in increased rates of metabolism and body heat production, which is known as the hormones calorigenic effect. t3 and t4 release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), which is produced by the anterior pituitary. tsh binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of t3 and t4 from a glycoprotein called thyroglobulin. thyroglobulin is present in the follicles of the thyroid, and is converted into thyroid hormones with the addition of iodine. iodine is formed from iodide ions that are actively transported into the thyroid follicle from the bloodstream. a peroxidase enzyme then attaches the iodine to the tyrosine amino acid found in thyroglobulin. t3 has three iodine ions attached, while t4 has four iodine ions attached. t3 and t4 are then released into the bloodstream, with t4 being released in much greater amounts than t3. as t3 is more active than t4 and is responsible for most of the effects of thyroid hormones, tissues of the body convert t4 to t3 by the removal of an iodine ion. most of the released t3 and t4 becomes attached to transport proteins in the bloodstream and is unable to cross the plasma membrane of cells. these protein-bound molecules are only released when blood levels of the unattached hormone begin to decline. in this way, a weeks worth of reserve hormone is maintained in the blood. increased t3 and t4 levels in the blood inhibit the release of tsh, which results in lower t3 and t4 release from the thyroid. the follicular cells of the thyroid require iodides (anions of iodine) in order to synthesize t3 and t4. iodides obtained from the diet are actively transported into follicle cells resulting in a concentration that is approximately 30 times higher than in blood. the typical diet in north america provides more iodine than required due to the addition of iodide to table salt. inadequate iodine intake, which occurs in many developing countries, results in an inability to synthesize t3 and t4 hormones. the thyroid gland enlarges in a condition called goiter, which is caused by overproduction of tsh without the formation of thyroid hormone. thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid, and tsh stimulation results in higher levels of colloid accumulation in the thyroid. in the absence of iodine, this is not converted to thyroid hormone, and colloid begins to accumulate more and more in the thyroid gland, leading to goiter. disorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones. hypothyroidism, underproduction of the thyroid hormones, can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain, sensitivity to cold, and reduced mental activity, among other symptoms. in children, hypothyroidism can cause cretinism, which can lead to mental retardation and growth defects. hyperthyroidism, the overproduction of thyroid hormones, can lead to an increased metabolic rate and its effects: weight loss, excess heat production, sweating, and an increased heart rate. graves disease is one example of a hyperthyroid condition. regulation of blood calcium concentrations is important for generation of muscle contractions and nerve impulses, which are electrically stimulated. if calcium levels get too high, membrane permeability to sodium decreases and membranes become less responsive. if calcium levels get too low, membrane permeability to sodium increases and convulsions or muscle spasms can result. blood calcium levels are regulated by parathyroid hormone (pth), which is produced by the parathyroid glands, as illustrated in [link]. pth is released in response to low blood ca2+ levels. pth increases ca2+ levels by targeting the skeleton, the kidneys, and the intestine. in the skeleton, pth stimulates osteoclasts, which causes bone to be reabsorbed, releasing ca2+ from bone into the blood. pth also inhibits osteoblasts, reducing ca2+ deposition in bone. in the intestines, pth increases dietary ca2+ absorption, and in the kidneys, pth stimulates reabsorption of the ca2+. while pth acts directly on the kidneys to increase ca2+ reabsorption, its effects on the intestine are indirect. pth triggers the formation of calcitriol, an active form of vitamin d, which acts on the intestines to increase absorption of dietary calcium. pth release is inhibited by rising blood calcium levels. hyperparathyroidism results from an overproduction of parathyroid hormone. this results in excessive calcium being removed from bones and introduced into blood circulation, producing structural weakness of the bones, which can lead to deformation and fractures, plus nervous system impairment due to high blood calcium levels. hypoparathyroidism, the underproduction of pth, results in extremely low levels of blood calcium, which causes impaired muscle function and may result in tetany (severe sustained muscle contraction). the hormone calcitonin, which is produced by the parafollicular or c cells of the thyroid, has the opposite effect on blood calcium levels as does pth. calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels by inhibiting osteoclasts, stimulating osteoblasts, and stimulating calcium excretion by the kidneys. this results in calcium being added to the bones to promote structural integrity. calcitonin is most important in children (when it stimulates bone growth), during pregnancy (when it reduces maternal bone loss), and during prolonged starvation (because it reduces bone mass loss). in healthy nonpregnant, unstarved adults, the role of calcitonin is unclear. hormonal regulation is required for the growth and replication of most cells in the body. growth hormone (gh), produced by the anterior portion of the pituitary gland, accelerates the rate of protein synthesis, particularly in skeletal muscle and bones. growth hormone has direct and indirect mechanisms of action. the first direct action of gh is stimulation of triglyceride breakdown (lipolysis) and release into the blood by adipocytes. this results in a switch by most tissues from utilizing glucose as an energy source to utilizing fatty acids. this process is called a glucose-sparing effect. in another direct mechanism, gh stimulates glycogen breakdown in the liver; the glycogen is then released into the blood as glucose. blood glucose levels increase as most tissues are utilizing fatty acids instead of glucose for their energy needs. the gh mediated increase in blood glucose levels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose levels seen in diabetes mellitus. the indirect mechanism of gh action is mediated by insulin-like growth factors (igfs) or somatomedins, which are a family of growth-promoting proteins produced by the liver, which stimulates tissue growth. igfs stimulate the uptake of amino acids from the blood, allowing the formation of new proteins, particularly in skeletal muscle cells, cartilage cells, and other target cells, as shown in [link]. this is especially important after a meal, when glucose and amino acid concentration levels are high in the blood. gh levels are regulated by two hormones produced by the hypothalamus. gh release is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (ghrh) and is inhibited by growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (ghih), also called somatostatin. a balanced production of growth hormone is critical for proper development. underproduction of gh in adults does not appear to cause any abnormalities, but in children it can result in pituitary dwarfism, in which growth is reduced. pituitary dwarfism is characterized by symmetric body formation. in some cases, individuals are under 30 inches in height. oversecretion of growth hormone can lead to gigantism in children, causing excessive growth. in some documented cases, individuals can reach heights of over eight feet. in adults, excessive gh can lead to acromegaly, a condition in which there is enlargement of bones in the face, hands, and feet that are still capable of growth. when a threat or danger is perceived, the body responds by releasing hormones that will ready it for the fight-or-flight response. the effects of this response are familiar to anyone who has been in a stressful situation: increased heart rate, dry mouth, and hair standing up. fight-or-flight responseinteractions of the endocrine hormones have evolved to ensure the bodys internal environment remains stable. stressors are stimuli that disrupt homeostasis. the sympathetic division of the vertebrate autonomic nervous system has evolved the fight-or-flight response to counter stress-induced disruptions of homeostasis. in the initial alarm phase, the sympathetic nervous system stimulates an increase in energy levels through increased blood glucose levels. this prepares the body for physical activity that may be required to respond to stress: to either fight for survival or to flee from danger. however, some stresses, such as illness or injury, can last for a long time. glycogen reserves, which provide energy in the short-term response to stress, are exhausted after several hours and cannot meet long-term energy needs. if glycogen reserves were the only energy source available, neural functioning could not be maintained once the reserves became depleted due to the nervous systems high requirement for glucose. in this situation, the body has evolved a response to counter long-term stress through the actions of the glucocorticoids, which ensure that long-term energy requirements can be met. the glucocorticoids mobilize lipid and protein reserves, stimulate gluconeogenesis, conserve glucose for use by neural tissue, and stimulate the conservation of salts and water. the mechanisms to maintain homeostasis that are described here are those observed in the human body. however, the fight-or-flight response exists in some form in all vertebrates. the sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus. stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla (which mediates short-term stress responses) via nerve impulses, and the adrenal cortex, which mediates long-term stress responses, via the hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth), which is produced by the anterior pituitary. when presented with a stressful situation, the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy. the hormones epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) are released by the adrenal medulla. how do these hormones provide a burst of energy? epinephrine and norepinephrine increase blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver and skeletal muscles to break down glycogen and by stimulating glucose release by liver cells. additionally, these hormones increase oxygen availability to cells by increasing the heart rate and dilating the bronchioles. the hormones also prioritize body function by increasing blood supply to essential organs such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles, while restricting blood flow to organs not in immediate need, such as the skin, digestive system, and kidneys. epinephrine and norepinephrine are collectively called catecholamines. watch this discovery channel animation describing the flight-or-flight response. long-term stress response differs from short-term stress response. the body cannot sustain the bursts of energy mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine for long times. instead, other hormones come into play. in a long-term stress response, the hypothalamus triggers the release of acth from the anterior pituitary gland. the adrenal cortex is stimulated by acth to release steroid hormones called corticosteroids. corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of target cells. they change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism. there are two main corticosteroids: glucocorticoids such as cortisol, and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. these hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue. the fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues to use for atp production. the glucocorticoids primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis. glucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system. for example, cortisone is used as an anti-inflammatory medication; however, it cannot be used long term as it increases susceptibility to disease due to its immune-suppressing effects. mineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body. the hormone aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney, which results in increased blood pressure and volume. hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as cushings disease, characterized by a shifting of fat storage areas of the body. this can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck, and excessive glucose in the blood. hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause addisons disease, which may result in bronzing of the skin, hypoglycemia, and low electrolyte levels in the blood. water levels in the body are controlled by antidiuretic hormone (adh), which is produced in the hypothalamus and triggers the reabsorption of water by the kidneys. underproduction of adh can cause diabetes insipidus. aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex of the kidneys, enhances na+ reabsorption from the extracellular fluids and subsequent water reabsorption by diffusion. the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is one way that aldosterone release is controlled. the reproductive system is controlled by the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh), which are produced by the pituitary gland. gonadotropin release is controlled by the hypothalamic hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh). fsh stimulates the maturation of sperm cells in males and is inhibited by the hormone inhibin, while lh stimulates the production of the androgen testosterone. fsh stimulates egg maturation in females, while lh stimulates the production of estrogens and progesterone. estrogens are a group of steroid hormones produced by the ovaries that trigger the development of secondary sex characteristics in females as well as control the maturation of the ova. in females, the pituitary also produces prolactin, which stimulates milk production after childbirth, and oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contraction during childbirth and milk let-down during suckling. insulin is produced by the pancreas in response to rising blood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize blood glucose and store excess glucose for later use. diabetes mellitus is caused by reduced insulin activity and causes high blood glucose levels, or hyperglycemia. glucagon is released by the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels and stimulates the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which can be used by the body. the bodys basal metabolic rate is controlled by the thyroid hormones thyroxine (t4) and triiodothyronine (t3). the anterior pituitary produces thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh), which controls the release of t3 and t4 from the thyroid gland. iodine is necessary in the production of thyroid hormone, and the lack of iodine can lead to a condition called goiter. parathyroid hormone (pth) is produced by the parathyroid glands in response to low blood ca2+ levels. the parafollicular cells of the thyroid produce calcitonin, which reduces blood ca2+ levels. growth hormone (gh) is produced by the anterior pituitary and controls the growth rate of muscle and bone. gh action is indirectly mediated by insulin-like growth factors (igfs). short-term stress causes the hypothalamus to trigger the adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and norepinephrine, which trigger the fight or flight response. long-term stress causes the hypothalamus to trigger the anterior pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth), which causes the release of corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids, from the adrenal cortex.","[('glucocorticoid',

194,stax-bio,37,The Endocrine System,4,m44771,Regulation of Hormone Production,"hormone production and release are primarily controlled by negative feedback. in negative feedback systems, a stimulus elicits the release of a substance; once the substance reaches a certain level, it sends a signal that stops further release of the substance. in this way, the concentration of hormones in blood is maintained within a narrow range. for example, the anterior pituitary signals the thyroid to release thyroid hormones. increasing levels of these hormones in the blood then give feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit further signaling to the thyroid gland, as illustrated in [link]. there are three mechanisms by which endocrine glands are stimulated to synthesize and release hormones: humoral stimuli, hormonal stimuli, and neural stimuli. the term humoral is derived from the term humor, which refers to bodily fluids such as blood. a humoral stimulus refers to the control of hormone release in response to changes in extracellular fluids such as blood or the ion concentration in the blood. for example, a rise in blood glucose levels triggers the pancreatic release of insulin. insulin causes blood glucose levels to drop, which signals the pancreas to stop producing insulin in a negative feedback loop. hormonal stimuli refers to the release of a hormone in response to another hormone. a number of endocrine glands release hormones when stimulated by hormones released by other endocrine glands. for example, the hypothalamus produces hormones that stimulate the anterior portion of the pituitary gland. the anterior pituitary in turn releases hormones that regulate hormone production by other endocrine glands. the anterior pituitary releases the thyroid-stimulating hormone, which then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce the hormones t3 and t4. as blood concentrations of t3 and t4 rise, they inhibit both the pituitary and the hypothalamus in a negative feedback loop. in some cases, the nervous system directly stimulates endocrine glands to release hormones, which is referred to as neural stimuli. recall that in a short-term stress response, the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are important for providing the bursts of energy required for the body to respond. here, neuronal signaling from the sympathetic nervous system directly stimulates the adrenal medulla to release the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine in response to stress. hormone levels are primarily controlled through negative feedback, in which rising levels of a hormone inhibit its further release. the three mechanisms of hormonal release are humoral stimuli, hormonal stimuli, and neural stimuli. humoral stimuli refers to the control of hormonal release in response to changes in extracellular fluid levels or ion levels. hormonal stimuli refers to the release of hormones in response to hormones released by other endocrine glands. neural stimuli refers to the release of hormones in response to neural stimulation.","[('neural stimuli', 'neural stimulis'), ('hormone', 'hormones'), ('hormonal stimuli', 'hormonal stimulis'), ('endocrine system', 'endocrine systems'), ('hormone production', 'hormone productions'), ('humoral stimuli', 'humoral stimulis'), ('endocrine', 'endocrines')]"
195,stax-bio,37,The Endocrine System,5,m44775,Endocrine Glands,"both the endocrine and nervous systems use chemical signals to communicate and regulate the body's physiology. the endocrine system releases hormones that act on target cells to regulate development, growth, energy metabolism, reproduction, and many behaviors. the nervous system releases neurotransmitters or neurohormones that regulate neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells. because the neurons can regulate the release of hormones, the nervous and endocrine systems work in a coordinated manner to regulate the body's physiology.  the hypothalamus in vertebrates integrates the endocrine and nervous systems. the hypothalamus is an endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain. it receives input from the body and other brain areas and initiates endocrine responses to environmental changes. the hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ, synthesizing hormones and transporting them along axons to the posterior pituitary gland. it synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland. the hypothalamus contains autonomic centers that control endocrine cells in the adrenal medulla via neuronal control. the pituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis or master gland is located at the base of the brain in the sella turcica, a groove of the sphenoid bone of the skull, illustrated in [link]. it is attached to the hypothalamus via a stalk called the pituitary stalk (or infundibulum). the anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release-inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus. the pituitary has two distinct regionsthe anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitarywhich between them secrete nine different peptide or protein hormones. the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland contains axons of the hypothalamic neurons. the anterior pituitary gland, or adenohypophysis, is surrounded by a capillary network that extends from the hypothalamus, down along the infundibulum, and to the anterior pituitary. this capillary network is a part of the hypophyseal portal system that carries substances from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary and hormones from the anterior pituitary into the circulatory system. a portal system carries blood from one capillary network to another; therefore, the hypophyseal portal system allows hormones produced by the hypothalamus to be carried directly to the anterior pituitary without first entering the circulatory system. the anterior pituitary produces seven hormones: growth hormone (gh), prolactin (prl), thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), melanin-stimulating hormone (msh), adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth), follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh), and luteinizing hormone (lh). anterior pituitary hormones are sometimes referred to as tropic hormones, because they control the functioning of other organs. while these hormones are produced by the anterior pituitary, their production is controlled by regulatory hormones produced by the hypothalamus. these regulatory hormones can be releasing hormones or inhibiting hormones, causing more or less of the anterior pituitary hormones to be secreted. these travel from the hypothalamus through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary where they exert their effect. negative feedback then regulates how much of these regulatory hormones are released and how much anterior pituitary hormone is secreted. the posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary. it is a part of the brain, extending down from the hypothalamus, and contains mostly nerve fibers and neuroglial cells, which support axons that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary. the posterior pituitary and the infundibulum together are referred to as the neurohypophysis. the hormones antidiuretic hormone (adh), also known as vasopressin, and oxytocin are produced by neurons in the hypothalamus and transported within these axons along the infundibulum to the posterior pituitary. they are released into the circulatory system via neural signaling from the hypothalamus. these hormones are considered to be posterior pituitary hormones, even though they are produced by the hypothalamus, because that is where they are released into the circulatory system. the posterior pituitary itself does not produce hormones, but instead stores hormones produced by the hypothalamus and releases them into the blood stream. the thyroid gland is located in the neck, just below the larynx and in front of the trachea, as shown in [link]. it is a butterfly-shaped gland with two lobes that are connected by the isthmus. it has a dark red color due to its extensive vascular system. when the thyroid swells due to dysfunction, it can be felt under the skin of the neck. the thyroid gland is made up of many spherical thyroid follicles, which are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium. these follicles contain a viscous fluid, called colloid, which stores the glycoprotein thyroglobulin, the precursor to the thyroid hormones. the follicles produce hormones that can be stored in the colloid or released into the surrounding capillary network for transport to the rest of the body via the circulatory system. thyroid follicle cells synthesize the hormone thyroxine, which is also known as t4 because it contains four atoms of iodine, and triiodothyronine, also known as t3 because it contains three atoms of iodine. follicle cells are stimulated to release stored t3 and t4 by thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh), which is produced by the anterior pituitary. these thyroid hormones increase the rates of mitochondrial atp production. a third hormone, calcitonin, is produced by parafollicular cells of the thyroid either releasing hormones or inhibiting hormones. calcitonin release is not controlled by tsh, but instead is released when calcium ion concentrations in the blood rise. calcitonin functions to help regulate calcium concentrations in body fluids. it acts in the bones to inhibit osteoclast activity and in the kidneys to stimulate excretion of calcium. the combination of these two events lowers body fluid levels of calcium. most people have four parathyroid glands; however, the number can vary from two to six. these glands are located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland, as shown in [link]. normally, there is a superior gland and an inferior gland associated with each of the thyroids two lobes. each parathyroid gland is covered by connective tissue and contains many secretory cells that are associated with a capillary network. the parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (pth). pth increases blood calcium concentrations when calcium ion levels fall below normal. pth (1) enhances reabsorption of ca2+ by the kidneys, (2) stimulates osteoclast activity and inhibits osteoblast activity, and (3) it stimulates synthesis and secretion of calcitriol by the kidneys, which enhances ca2+ absorption by the digestive system. pth is produced by chief cells of the parathyroid. pth and calcitonin work in opposition to one another to maintain homeostatic ca2+ levels in body fluids. another type of cells, oxyphil cells, exist in the parathyroid but their function is not known. these hormones encourage bone growth, muscle mass, and blood cell formation in children and women. the adrenal glands are associated with the kidneys; one gland is located on top of each kidney as illustrated in [link]. the adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla. these regions secrete different hormones. the adrenal cortex is made up of layers of epithelial cells and associated capillary networks. these layers form three distinct regions: an outer zona glomerulosa that produces mineralocorticoids, a middle zona fasciculata that produces glucocorticoids, and an inner zona reticularis that produces androgens. the main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, which regulates the concentration of na+ ions in urine, sweat, pancreas, and saliva. aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex is stimulated by a decrease in blood concentrations of sodium ions, blood volume, or blood pressure, or by an increase in blood potassium levels. the three main glucocorticoids are cortisol, corticosterone, and cortisone. the glucocorticoids stimulate the synthesis of glucose and gluconeogenesis (converting a non-carbohydrate to glucose) by liver cells and they promote the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue. these hormones increase blood glucose levels to maintain levels within a normal range between meals. these hormones are secreted in response to acth and levels are regulated by negative feedback. androgens are sex hormones that promote masculinity. they are produced in small amounts by the adrenal cortex in both males and females. they do not affect sexual characteristics and may supplement sex hormones released from the gonads. the adrenal medulla contains large, irregularly shaped cells that are closely associated with blood vessels. these cells are innervated by preganglionic autonomic nerve fibers from the central nervous system. the adrenal medulla contains two types of secretory cells: one that produces epinephrine (adrenaline) and another that produces norepinephrine (noradrenaline). epinephrine is the primary adrenal medulla hormone accounting for 75 to 80 percent of its secretions. epinephrine and norepinephrine increase heart rate, breathing rate, cardiac muscle contractions, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. they also accelerate the breakdown of glucose in skeletal muscles and stored fats in adipose tissue. the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is stimulated by neural impulses from the sympathetic nervous system. secretion of these hormones is stimulated by acetylcholine release from preganglionic sympathetic fibers innervating the adrenal medulla. these neural impulses originate from the hypothalamus in response to stress to prepare the body for the fight-or-flight response. the pancreas, illustrated in [link], is an elongated organ that is located between the stomach and the proximal portion of the small intestine. it contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release hormones. it is sometimes referred to as a heterocrine gland because it has both endocrine and exocrine functions. the endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of langerhans, as visible in the micrograph shown in [link]. the pancreatic islets contain two primary cell types: alpha cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, and beta cells, which produce the hormone insulin. these hormones regulate blood glucose levels. as blood glucose levels decline, alpha cells release glucagon to raise the blood glucose levels by increasing rates of glycogen breakdown and glucose release by the liver. when blood glucose levels rise, such as after a meal, beta cells release insulin to lower blood glucose levels by increasing the rate of glucose uptake in most body cells, and by increasing glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscles and the liver. together, glucagon and insulin regulate blood glucose levels. 
the pineal gland produces melatonin. the rate of melatonin production is affected by the photoperiod. collaterals from the visual pathways innervate the pineal gland. during the day photoperiod, little melatonin is produced; however, melatonin production increases during the dark photoperiod (night). in some mammals, melatonin has an inhibitory affect on reproductive functions by decreasing production and maturation of sperm, oocytes, and reproductive organs. melatonin is an effective antioxidant, protecting the cns from free radicals such as nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide. lastly, melatonin is involved in biological rhythms, particularly circadian rhythms such as the sleep-wake cycle and eating habits.  
 the gonadsthe male testes and female ovariesproduce steroid hormones. the testes produce androgens, testosterone being the most prominent, which allow for the development of secondary sex characteristics and the production of sperm cells. the ovaries produce estradiol and progesterone, which cause secondary sex characteristics and prepare the body for childbirth. there are several organs whose primary functions are non-endocrine but that also possess endocrine functions. these include the heart, kidneys, intestines, thymus, gonads, and adipose tissue. the heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells. these cells release the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) in response to increased blood volume. high blood volume causes the cells to be stretched, resulting in hormone release. anp acts on the kidneys to reduce the reabsorption of na+, causing na+ and water to be excreted in the urine. anp also reduces the amounts of renin released by the kidneys and aldosterone released by the adrenal cortex, further preventing the retention of water. in this way, anp causes a reduction in blood volume and blood pressure, and reduces the concentration of na+ in the blood. the gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion. the endocrine cells are located in the mucosa of the gi tract throughout the stomach and small intestine. some of the hormones produced include gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin, which are secreted in the presence of food, and some of which act on other organs such as the pancreas, gallbladder, and liver. they trigger the release of gastric juices, which help to break down and digest food in the gi tract. while the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major endocrine glands, the kidneys themselves also possess endocrine function. renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone. aldosterone then causes the retention of na+ and water, raising blood volume. the kidneys also release calcitriol, which aids in the absorption of ca2+ and phosphate ions. erythropoietin (epo) is a protein hormone that triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. epo is released in response to low oxygen levels. because red blood cells are oxygen carriers, increased production results in greater oxygen delivery throughout the body. epo has been used by athletes to improve performance, as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells allows for greater endurance. because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood, artificially high levels of epo can cause severe health risks. the thymus is found behind the sternum; it is most prominent in infants, becoming smaller in size through adulthood. the thymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins, which contribute to the development of the immune response. adipose tissue is a connective tissue found throughout the body. it produces the hormone leptin in response to food intake. leptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons, producing a feeling of satiety after eating, thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating. leptin is also associated with reproduction. it must be present for gnrh and gonadotropin synthesis to occur. extremely thin females may enter puberty late; however, if adipose levels increase, more leptin will be produced, improving fertility. the pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and is attached to the hypothalamus by the infundibulum. the anterior pituitary receives products from the hypothalamus by the hypophyseal portal system and produces six hormones. the posterior pituitary is an extension of the brain and releases hormones (antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin) produced by the hypothalamus. the thyroid gland is located in the neck and is composed of two lobes connected by the isthmus. the thyroid is made up of follicle cells that produce the hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine. parafollicular cells of the thyroid produce calcitonin. the parathyroid glands lie on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland and produce parathyroid hormone. the adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and consist of the renal cortex and renal medulla. the adrenal cortex is the outer part of the adrenal gland and produces the corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids. the adrenal medulla is the inner part of the adrenal gland and produces the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine. the pancreas lies in the abdomen between the stomach and the small intestine. clusters of endocrine cells in the pancreas form the islets of langerhans, which are composed of alpha cells that release glucagon and beta cells that release insulin. some organs possess endocrine activity as a secondary function but have another primary function. the heart produces the hormone atrial natriuretic peptide, which functions to reduce blood volume, pressure, and na+ concentration. the gastrointestinal tract produces various hormones that aid in digestion. the kidneys produce renin, calcitriol, and erythropoietin. adipose tissue produces leptin, which promotes satiety signals in the brain.","[('betum cell', 'betum cells'), ('isthmu', 'isthmuss', 'isthmus'), ('endocrine system', 'endocrine systems'), ('pituitary gland', 'pituitary glands'), ('pancrea', 'pancreass', 'pancreas'), ('anp', 'anps'), ('epo', 'epoes'), ('thyroid gland', 'thyroid glands'), ('secondary endocrine function', 'secondary endocrine functions', 'secondary endocrines function', 'secondary endocrines functions'), ('adrenal medulla', 'adrenal medullas'), ('alpha cell', 'alpha cells'), ('parafollicular cell', 'parafollicular cells'), ('posterior pituitary', 'posterior pituitaries'), ('erythropoietin', 'erythropoietins'), ('endocrine gland', 'endocrine glands'), ('adrenal gland', 'adrenal glands'), ('pancreatic islet', 'pancreatic isletss', 'pancreatic islets'), ('exocrine gland', 'exocrine glands'), ('adrenal cortex', 'adrenal cortices'), ('atrial natriuretic peptide', 'atrial natriuretic peptides'), ('infundibulum', 'infundibulums'), ('hypophyseal portal system', 'hypophyseal portal systems'), ('thymu', 'thymuss', 'thymus'), ('hormone', 'hormones'), ('islet of langerhan', 'islet of langerhans', 'islet of langerhans', 'islets of langerhan', 'islets of langerhans', 'islets of langerhans'), ('parathyroid gland', 'parathyroid glands'), ('anterior pituitary', 'anterior pituitaries'), ('colloid', 'colloids'), ('thyroid', 'thyroids'), ('leptin', 'leptins'), ('endocrine', 'endocrines')]"
196,stax-bio,38,The Musculoskeletal System,0,m44783,Introduction,"the muscular and skeletal systems provide support to the body and allow for a wide range of movement. the bones of the skeletal system protect the bodys internal organs and support the weight of the body. the muscles of the muscular system contract and pull on the bones, allowing for movements as diverse as standing, walking, running, and grasping items. injury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be very debilitating. in humans, the most common musculoskeletal diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition. ailments that affect the joints are also widespread, such as arthritis, which can make movement difficult andin advanced casescompletely impair mobility. in severe cases in which the joint has suffered extensive damage, joint replacement surgery may be needed. progress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the development of artificial joints, with joint replacement surgery in the hips and knees being the most common. replacement joints for shoulders, elbows, and fingers are also available. even with this progress, there is still room for improvement in the design of prostheses. the state-of-the-art prostheses have limited durability and therefore wear out quickly, particularly in young or active individuals. current research is focused on the use of new materials, such as carbon fiber, that may make prostheses more durable.","[('excitationcontraction coupling', 'excitationcontraction couplings'), ('intervertebral disc', 'intervertebral discs'),

197,stax-bio,38,The Musculoskeletal System,1,m44781,Types of Skeletal Systems,"a skeletal system is necessary to support the body, protect internal organs, and allow for the movement of an organism. there are three different skeleton designs that fulfill these functions: hydrostatic skeleton, exoskeleton, and endoskeleton. a hydrostatic skeleton is a skeleton formed by a fluid-filled compartment within the body, called the coelom. the organs of the coelom are supported by the aqueous fluid, which also resists external compression. this compartment is under hydrostatic pressure because of the fluid and supports the other organs of the organism. this type of skeletal system is found in soft-bodied animals such as sea anemones, earthworms, cnidaria, and other invertebrates ([link]). movement in a hydrostatic skeleton is provided by muscles that surround the coelom. the muscles in a hydrostatic skeleton contract to change the shape of the coelom; the pressure of the fluid in the coelom produces movement. for example, earthworms move by waves of muscular contractions of the skeletal muscle of the body wall hydrostatic skeleton, called peristalsis, which alternately shorten and lengthen the body. lengthening the body extends the anterior end of the organism. most organisms have a mechanism to fix themselves in the substrate. shortening the muscles then draws the posterior portion of the body forward. although a hydrostatic skeleton is well-suited to invertebrate organisms such as earthworms and some aquatic organisms, it is not an efficient skeleton for terrestrial animals. an exoskeleton is an external skeleton that consists of a hard encasement on the surface of an organism. for example, the shells of crabs and insects are exoskeletons ([link]). this skeleton type provides defence against predators, supports the body, and allows for movement through the contraction of attached muscles. as with vertebrates, muscles must cross a joint inside the exoskeleton. shortening of the muscle changes the relationship of the two segments of the exoskeleton. arthropods such as crabs and lobsters have exoskeletons that consist of 3050 percent chitin, a polysaccharide derivative of glucose that is a strong but flexible material. chitin is secreted by the epidermal cells. the exoskeleton is further strengthened by the addition of calcium carbonate in organisms such as the lobster. because the exoskeleton is acellular, arthropods must periodically shed their exoskeletons because the exoskeleton does not grow as the organism grows. an endoskeleton is a skeleton that consists of hard, mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of organisms. an example of a primitive endoskeletal structure is the spicules of sponges. the bones of vertebrates are composed of tissues, whereas sponges have no true tissues ([link]). endoskeletons provide support for the body, protect internal organs, and allow for movement through contraction of muscles attached to the skeleton. the human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones in the adult. it has five main functions: providing support to the body, storing minerals and lipids, producing blood cells, protecting internal organs, and allowing for movement. the skeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton (which consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage), and the appendicular skeleton (which consists of the shoulders, limb bones, the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle). the axial skeleton forms the central axis of the body and includes the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear, hyoid bone of the throat, vertebral column, and the thoracic cage (ribcage) ([link]). the function of the axial skeleton is to provide support and protection for the brain, the spinal cord, and the organs in the ventral body cavity. it provides a surface for the attachment of muscles that move the head, neck, and trunk, performs respiratory movements, and stabilizes parts of the appendicular skeleton. the bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain. the skull consists of 22 bones, which are divided into two categories: cranial bones and facial bones. the cranial bones are eight bones that form the cranial cavity, which encloses the brain and serves as an attachment site for the muscles of the head and neck. the eight cranial bones are the frontal bone, two parietal bones, two temporal bones, occipital bone, sphenoid bone, and the ethmoid bone. although the bones developed separately in the embryo and fetus, in the adult, they are tightly fused with connective tissue and adjoining bones do not move ([link]). the auditory ossicles of the middle ear transmit sounds from the air as vibrations to the fluid-filled cochlea. the auditory ossicles consist of three bones each: the malleus, incus, and stapes. these are the smallest bones in the body and are unique to mammals. fourteen facial bones form the face, provide cavities for the sense organs (eyes, mouth, and nose), protect the entrances to the digestive and respiratory tracts, and serve as attachment points for facial muscles. the 14 facial bones are the nasal bones, the maxillary bones, zygomatic bones, palatine, vomer, lacrimal bones, the inferior nasal conchae, and the mandible. all of these bones occur in pairs except for the mandible and the vomer ([link]). although it is not found in the skull, the hyoid bone is considered a component of the axial skeleton. the hyoid bone lies below the mandible in the front of the neck. it acts as a movable base for the tongue and is connected to muscles of the jaw, larynx, and tongue. the mandible articulates with the base of the skull. the mandible controls the opening to the airway and gut.  in animals with teeth, the mandible brings the surfaces of the teeth in contact with the maxillary teeth. the vertebral column, or spinal column, surrounds and protects the spinal cord, supports the head, and acts as an attachment point for the ribs and muscles of the back and neck.  the adult vertebral column comprises 26 bones: the 24 vertebrae, the sacrum, and the coccyx bones. in the adult, the sacrum is typically composed of five vertebrae that fuse into one. the coccyx is typically 34 vertebrae that fuse into one. around the age of 70, the sacrum and the coccyx may fuse together. we begin life with approximately 33 vertebrae, but as we grow, several vertebrae fuse together. the adult vertebrae are further divided into the 7 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, and 5 lumbar vertebrae ([link]). each vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the nerves of the spinal cord pass. there is also a notch on each side through which the spinal nerves, which serve the body at that level, can exit from the spinal cord. the vertebral column is approximately 71 cm (28 inches) in adult male humans and is curved, which can be seen from a side view. the names of the spinal curves correspond to the region of the spine in which they occur. the thoracic and sacral curves are concave (curve inwards relative to the front of the body) and the cervical and lumbar curves are convex (curve outwards relative to the front of the body). the arched curvature of the vertebral column increases its strength and flexibility, allowing it to absorb shocks like a spring ([link]). intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum. each disc is part of a joint that allows for some movement of the spine and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from movements such as walking and running. intervertebral discs also act as ligaments to bind vertebrae together. the inner part of discs, the nucleus pulposus, hardens as people age and becomes less elastic. this loss of elasticity diminishes its ability to absorb shocks. the thoracic cage, also known as the ribcage, is the skeleton of the chest, and consists of the ribs, sternum, thoracic vertebrae, and costal cartilages ([link]). the thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity, including the heart and lungs. it also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper limbs, and serves as the attachment point for the diaphragm, muscles of the back, chest, neck, and shoulders.  changes in the volume of the thorax enable breathing. the sternum, or breastbone, is a long, flat bone located at the anterior of the chest. it is formed from three bones that fuse in the adult. the ribs are 12 pairs of long, curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body, forming the ribcage. costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum, with the exception of rib pairs 11 and 12, which are free-floating ribs. the appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the upper limbs (which function to grasp and manipulate objects) and the lower limbs (which permit locomotion). it also includes the pectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, that attaches the upper limbs to the body, and the pelvic girdle that attaches the lower limbs to the body ([link]). the pectoral girdle bones provide the points of attachment of the upper limbs to the axial skeleton. the human pectoral girdle consists of the clavicle (or collarbone) in the anterior, and the scapula (or shoulder blades) in the posterior ([link]). the clavicles are s-shaped bones that position the arms on the body. the clavicles lie horizontally across the front of the thorax (chest) just above the first rib. these bones are fairly fragile and are susceptible to fractures. for example, a fall with the arms outstretched causes the force to be transmitted to the clavicles, which can break if the force is excessive. the clavicle articulates with the sternum and the scapula. the scapulae are flat, triangular bones that are located at the back of the pectoral girdle. they support the muscles crossing the shoulder joint. a ridge, called the spine, runs across the back of the scapula and can easily be felt through the skin ([link]). the spine of the scapula is a good example of a bony protrusion that facilitates a broad area of attachment for muscles to bone. the upper limb contains 30 bones in three regions: the arm (shoulder to elbow), the forearm (ulna and radius), and the wrist and hand ([link]). an articulation is any place at which two bones are joined. the humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb and the only bone of the arm. it articulates with the scapula at the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow. the forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones: the ulna and the radius. the radius is located along the lateral (thumb) side of the forearm and articulates with the humerus at the elbow. the ulna is located on the medial aspect (pinky-finger side) of the forearm. it is longer than the radius. the ulna articulates with the humerus at the elbow. the radius and ulna also articulate with the carpal bones and with each other, which in vertebrates enables a variable degree of rotation of the carpus with respect to the long axis of the limb.  the hand includes the eight bones of the carpus (wrist), the five bones of the metacarpus (palm), and the 14 bones of the phalanges (digits). each digit consists of three phalanges, except for the thumb, when present, which has only two. the pelvic girdle attaches to the lower limbs of the axial skeleton. because it is responsible for bearing the weight of the body and for locomotion, the pelvic girdle is securely attached to the axial skeleton by strong ligaments. it also has deep sockets with robust ligaments to securely attach the femur to the body. the pelvic girdle is further strengthened by two large hip bones. in adults, the hip bones, or coxal bones, are formed by the fusion of three pairs of bones: the ilium, ischium, and pubis. the pelvis joins together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the sacrum at the posterior of the body. the female pelvis is slightly different from the male pelvis. over generations of evolution, females with a wider pubic angle and larger diameter pelvic canal reproduced more successfully. therefore, their offspring also had pelvic anatomy that enabled successful childbirth ([link]). the lower limb consists of the thigh, the leg, and the foot. the bones of the lower limb are the femur (thigh bone), patella (kneecap), tibia and fibula (bones of the leg), tarsals (bones of the ankle), and metatarsals and phalanges (bones of the foot) ([link]). the bones of the lower limbs are thicker and stronger than the bones of the upper limbs because of the need to support the entire weight of the body and the resulting forces from locomotion. in addition to evolutionary fitness, the bones of an individual will respond to forces exerted upon them. the femur, or thighbone, is the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the body. the femur and pelvis form the hip joint at the proximal end. at the distal end, the femur, tibia, and patella form the knee joint. the patella, or kneecap, is a triangular bone that lies anterior to the knee joint. the patella is embedded in the tendon of the femoral extensors (quadriceps). it improves knee extension by reducing friction. the tibia, or shinbone, is a large bone of the leg that is located directly below the knee. the tibia articulates with the femur at its proximal end, with the fibula and the tarsal bones at its distal end. it is the second largest bone in the human body and is responsible for transmitting the weight of the body from the femur to the foot. the fibula, or calf bone, parallels and articulates with the tibia. it does not articulate with the femur and does not bear weight. the fibula acts as a site for muscle attachment and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint. the tarsals are the seven bones of the ankle. the ankle transmits the weight of the body from the tibia and the fibula to the foot. the metatarsals are the five bones of the foot. the phalanges are the 14 bones of the toes. each toe consists of three phalanges, except for the big toe that has only two ([link]). variations exist in other species; for example, the horses metacarpals and metatarsals are oriented vertically and do not make contact with the substrate. evolution of body design for locomotion on land
the transition of vertebrates onto land required a number of changes in body design, as movement on land presents a number of challenges for animals that are adapted to movement in water. the buoyancy of water provides a certain amount of lift, and a common form of movement by fish is lateral undulations of the entire body. this back and forth movement pushes the body against the water, creating forward movement. in most fish, the muscles of paired fins attach to girdles within the body, allowing for some control of locomotion. as certain fish began moving onto land, they retained their lateral undulation form of locomotion (anguilliform). however, instead of pushing against water, their fins or flippers became points of contact with the ground, around which they rotated their bodies. the effect of gravity and the lack of buoyancy on land meant that body weight was suspended on the limbs, leading to increased strengthening and ossification of the limbs. the effect of gravity also required changes to the axial skeleton. lateral undulations of land animal vertebral columns cause torsional strain. a firmer, more ossified vertebral column became common in terrestrial tetrapods because it reduces strain while providing the strength needed to support the bodys weight. in later tetrapods, the vertebrae began allowing for vertical motion rather than lateral flexion. another change in the axial skeleton was the loss of a direct attachment between the pectoral girdle and the head. this reduced the jarring to the head caused by the impact of the limbs on the ground. the vertebrae of the neck also evolved to allow movement of the head independently of the body. the appendicular skeleton of land animals is also different from aquatic animals. the shoulders attach to the pectoral girdle through muscles and connective tissue, thus reducing the jarring of the skull. because of a lateral undulating vertebral column, in early tetrapods, the limbs were splayed out to the side and movement occurred by performing push-ups. the vertebrae of these animals had to move side-to-side in a similar manner to fish and reptiles. this type of motion requires large muscles to move the limbs toward the midline; it was almost like walking while doing push-ups, and it is not an efficient use of energy. later tetrapods have their limbs placed under their bodies, so that each stride requires less force to move forward. this resulted in decreased adductor muscle size and an increased range of motion of the scapulae. this also restricts movement primarily to one plane, creating forward motion rather than moving the limbs upward as well as forward.  the femur and humerus were also rotated, so that the ends of the limbs and digits were pointed forward, in the direction of motion, rather than out to the side. by placement underneath the body, limbs can swing forward like a pendulum to produce a stride that is more efficient for moving over land. the three types of skeleton designs are hydrostatic skeletons, exoskeletons, and endoskeletons. a hydrostatic skeleton is formed by a fluid-filled compartment held under hydrostatic pressure; movement is created by the muscles producing pressure on the fluid. an exoskeleton is a hard external skeleton that protects the outer surface of an organism and enables movement through muscles attached on the inside. an endoskeleton is an internal skeleton composed of hard, mineralized tissue that also enables movement by attachment to muscles. the human skeleton is an endoskeleton that is composed of the axial and appendicular skeleton. the axial skeleton is composed of the bones of the skull, ossicles of the ear, hyoid bone, vertebral column, and ribcage. the skull consists of eight cranial bones and 14 facial bones. six bones make up the ossicles of the middle ear, while the hyoid bone is located in the neck under the mandible. the vertebral column contains 26 bones, and it surrounds and protects the spinal cord. the thoracic cage consists of the sternum, ribs, thoracic vertebrae, and costal cartilages. the appendicular skeleton is made up of the limbs of the upper and lower limbs. the pectoral girdle is composed of the clavicles and the scapulae. the upper limb contains 30 bones in the arm, the forearm, and the hand. the pelvic girdle attaches the lower limbs to the axial skeleton. the lower limb includes the bones of the thigh, the leg, and the foot.","[('sternum', 'sternums'), ('intervertebral disc', 'intervertebral discs'), ('appendicular skeleton', 'appendicular skeletons'), ('vertebral column', 'vertebral columns'), ('scapula', 'scapulas'), ('metatarsal', 'metatarsals'), ('middle ear', 'middle ears'), ('thoracic cage', 'thoracic cages'), ('fibula', 'fibulas'), ('ulna', 'ulnas'), ('skeleton evolution', 'skeleton evolutions'), ('skull', 'skulls'), ('coxal bone', 'coxal bones'), ('endoskeleton', 'endoskeletons'), ('musculoskeletal system', 'musculoskeletal systems'), ('pectoral girdle', 'pectoral girdles'), ('ribcage', 'ribcages'), ('lower limb', 'lower limbs'), ('exoskeleton', 'exoskeletons'), ('radiu', 'radii', 'radius'), ('clavicle', 'clavicles'), ('spine', 'spines'), ('tarsal', 'tarsals'), ('skeletal system', 'skeletal systems'), ('tibium', 'tibias', 'tibia'), ('cranial bone', 'cranial bones'), ('auditory ossicle', 'auditory ossicles'), ('humeru', 'humeruss', 'humerus'), ('hyoid bone', 'hyoid bones'), ('thighbone', 'thighbones'), ('shinbone', 'shinbones'), ('facial bone', 'facial bones'), ('hydrostatic skeleton', 'hydrostatic skeletons'), ('axial skeleton', 'axial skeletons'), ('rib', 'ribs'), ('kneecap', 'kneecaps'), ('calf bone', 'calf bones'), ('human skeletal system', 'human skeletal systems'), ('patella', 'patellas'), ('forearm', 'forearms'), ('femur', 'femurs'), ('human skeleton', 'human skeletons'), ('hip bone', 'hip bones'), ('locomotion', 'locomotions')]"
198,stax-bio,38,The Musculoskeletal System,2,m44789,Bone,"bone, or osseous tissue, is a connective tissue that constitutes the endoskeleton. it contains specialized cells and a matrix of mineral salts and collagen fibers. the mineral salts primarily include hydroxyapatite, a mineral formed from calcium phosphate. calcification is the process of deposition of mineral salts on the collagen fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue. the process of calcification only occurs in the presence of collagen fibers. the bones of the human skeleton are classified by their shape: long bones, short bones, flat bones, sutural bones, sesamoid bones, and irregular bones ([link]). long bones are longer than they are wide and have a shaft and two ends. the diaphysis, or central shaft, contains bone marrow in a marrow cavity. the rounded ends, the epiphyses, are covered with articular cartilage and are filled with red bone marrow, which produces blood cells ([link]). most of the limb bones are long bonesfor example, the femur, tibia, ulna, and radius. exceptions to this include the patella and the bones of the wrist and ankle. short bones, or cuboidal bones, are bones that are the same width and length, giving them a cube-like shape. for example, the bones of the wrist (carpals) and ankle (tarsals) are short bones ([link]). flat bones are thin and relatively broad bones that are found where extensive protection of organs is required or where broad surfaces of muscle attachment are required. examples of flat bones are the sternum (breast bone), ribs, scapulae (shoulder blades), and the roof of the skull ([link]). irregular bones are bones with complex shapes. these bones may have short, flat, notched, or ridged surfaces. examples of irregular bones are the vertebrae, hip bones, and several skull bones. sesamoid bones are small, flat bones and are shaped similarly to a sesame seed. the patellae are sesamoid bones ([link]). sesamoid bones develop inside tendons and may be found near joints at the knees, hands, and feet. sutural bones are small, flat, irregularly shaped bones. they may be found between the flat bones of the skull. they vary in number, shape, size, and position. bones are considered organs because they contain various types of tissue, such as blood, connective tissue, nerves, and bone tissue. osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral matrix of bones. there are two types of bone tissue: compact and spongy. compact bone (or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone marrow. it provides protection and strength to bones. compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or haversian systems. osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport blood. they are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. each osteon consists of lamellae, which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the haversian canal. the haversian canal (osteonic canal) contains the bones blood vessels and nerve fibers ([link]). osteons in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing. therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at which stresses are applied in only a few directions. whereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones, spongy bone or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all bones. spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute compact bone tissue. instead, it consists of trabeculae, which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates. red bone marrow is found between the trabuculae. blood vessels within this tissue deliver nutrients to osteocytes and remove waste. the red bone marrow of the femur and the interior of other large bones, such as the ileum, forms blood cells. spongy bone reduces the density of bone and allows the ends of long bones to compress as the result of stresses applied to the bone. spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not heavily stressed or where stresses arrive from many directions. the epiphyses of bones, such as the neck of the femur, are subject to stress from many directions. imagine laying a heavy framed picture flat on the floor.  you could hold up one side of the picture with a toothpick if the toothpick was perpendicular to the floor and the picture. now drill a hole and stick the toothpick into the wall to hang up the picture. in this case, the function of the toothpick is to transmit the downward pressure of the picture to the wall. the force on the picture is straight down to the floor, but the force on the toothpick is both the picture wire pulling down and the bottom of the hole in the wall pushing up. the toothpick will break off right at the wall. the neck of the femur is horizontal like the toothpick in the wall. the weight of the body pushes it down near the joint, but the vertical diaphysis of the femur pushes it up at the other end. the neck of the femur must be strong enough to transfer the downward force of the body weight horizontally to the vertical shaft of the femur ([link]). bone consists of four types of cells: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and osteoprogenitor cells. osteoblasts are bone cells that are responsible for bone formation. osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic part and inorganic part of the extracellular matrix of bone tissue, and collagen fibers. osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active osteocytes. osteoclasts are large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei. they remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve the bony matrix. these minerals, released from bones into the blood, help regulate calcium concentrations in body fluids. bone may also be resorbed for remodeling, if the applied stresses have changed. osteocytes are mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue; these cells cannot divide. osteocytes maintain normal bone structure by recycling the mineral salts in the bony matrix. osteoprogenitor cells are squamous stem cells that divide to produce daughter cells that differentiate into osteoblasts. osteoprogenitor cells are important in the repair of fractures. ossification, or osteogenesis, is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts. ossification is distinct from the process of calcification; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones, it can also occur in other tissues. ossification begins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo. before this time, the embryonic skeleton consists entirely of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. the development of bone from fibrous membranes is called intramembranous ossification; development from hyaline cartilage is called endochondral ossification. bone growth continues until approximately age 25. bones can grow in thickness throughout life, but after age 25, ossification functions primarily in bone remodeling and repair. intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. it is involved in the formation of the flat bones of the skull, the mandible, and the clavicles. ossification begins as mesenchymal cells form a template of the future bone. they then differentiate into osteoblasts at the ossification center. osteoblasts secrete the extracellular matrix and deposit calcium, which hardens the matrix. the non-mineralized portion of the bone or osteoid continues to form around blood vessels, forming spongy bone. connective tissue in the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow in the fetus. the spongy bone is remodeled into a thin layer of compact bone on the surface of the spongy bone. endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. all of the bones of the body, except for the flat bones of the skull, mandible, and clavicles, are formed through endochondral ossification. in long bones, chondrocytes form a template of the hyaline cartilage diaphysis. responding to complex developmental signals, the matrix begins to calcify. this calcification prevents diffusion of nutrients into the matrix, resulting in chondrocytes dying and the opening up of cavities in the diaphysis cartilage. blood vessels invade the cavities, and osteoblasts and osteoclasts modify the calcified cartilage matrix into spongy bone. osteoclasts then break down some of the spongy bone to create a marrow, or medullary, cavity in the center of the diaphysis. dense, irregular connective tissue forms a sheath (periosteum) around the bones. the periosteum assists in attaching the bone to surrounding tissues, tendons, and ligaments. the bone continues to grow and elongate as the cartilage cells at the epiphyses divide. in the last stage of prenatal bone development, the centers of the epiphyses begin to calcify. secondary ossification centers form in the epiphyses as blood vessels and osteoblasts enter these areas and convert hyaline cartilage into spongy bone. until adolescence, hyaline cartilage persists at the epiphyseal plate (growth plate), which is the region between the diaphysis and epiphysis that is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones ([link]). long bones continue to lengthen, potentially until adolescence, through the addition of bone tissue at the epiphyseal plate. they also increase in width through appositional growth. chondrocytes on the epiphyseal side of the epiphyseal plate divide; one cell remains undifferentiated near the epiphysis, and one cell moves toward the diaphysis. the cells, which are pushed from the epiphysis, mature and are destroyed by calcification. this process replaces cartilage with bone on the diaphyseal side of the plate, resulting in a lengthening of the bone. long bones stop growing at around the age of 18 in females and the age of 21 in males in a process called epiphyseal plate closure. during this process, cartilage cells stop dividing and all of the cartilage is replaced by bone. the epiphyseal plate fades, leaving a structure called the epiphyseal line or epiphyseal remnant, and the epiphysis and diaphysis fuse. appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bony tissue at the surface of bones. osteoblasts at the bone surface secrete bone matrix, and osteoclasts on the inner surface break down bone. the osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes. a balance between these two processes allows the bone to thicken without becoming too heavy. bone renewal continues after birth into adulthood. bone remodeling is the replacement of old bone tissue by new bone tissue. it involves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. normal bone growth requires vitamins d, c, and a, plus minerals such as calcium, phosphorous, and magnesium. hormones such as parathyroid hormone, growth hormone, and calcitonin are also required for proper bone growth and maintenance. bone turnover rates are quite high, with five to seven percent of bone mass being recycled every week. differences in turnover rate exist in different areas of the skeleton and in different areas of a bone. for example, the bone in the head of the femur may be fully replaced every six months, whereas the bone along the shaft is altered much more slowly. bone remodeling allows bones to adapt to stresses by becoming thicker and stronger when subjected to stress. bones that are not subject to normal stress, for example when a limb is in a cast, will begin to lose mass.  a fractured or broken bone undergoes repair through four stages: blood vessels in the broken bone tear and hemorrhage, resulting in the formation of clotted blood, or a hematoma, at the site of the break. the severed blood vessels at the broken ends of the bone are sealed by the clotting process, and bone cells that are deprived of nutrients begin to die. within days of the fracture, capillaries grow into the hematoma, and phagocytic cells begin to clear away the dead cells. though fragments of the blood clot may remain, fibroblasts and osteoblasts enter the area and begin to reform bone. fibroblasts produce collagen fibers that connect the broken bone ends, and osteoblasts start to form spongy bone. the repair tissue between the broken bone ends is called the fibrocartilaginous callus, as it is composed of both hyaline and fibrocartilage ([link]). some bone spicules may also appear at this point. the fibrocartilaginous callus is converted into a bony callus of spongy bone. it takes about two months for the broken bone ends to be firmly joined together after the fracture. this is similar to the endochondral formation of bone, as cartilage becomes ossified; osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone matrix are present. the bony callus is then remodelled by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, with excess material on the exterior of the bone and within the medullary cavity being removed. compact bone is added to create bone tissue that is similar to the original, unbroken bone. this remodeling can take many months, and the bone may remain uneven for years.  decalcification of bones
question: what effect does the removal of calcium and collagen have on bone structure? background: conduct a literature search on the role of calcium and collagen in maintaining bone structure. conduct a literature search on diseases in which bone structure is compromised. hypothesis: develop a hypothesis that states predictions of the flexibility, strength, and mass of bones that have had the calcium and collagen components removed. develop a hypothesis regarding the attempt to add calcium back to decalcified bones. test the hypothesis: test the prediction by removing calcium from chicken bones by placing them in a jar of vinegar for seven days. test the hypothesis regarding adding calcium back to decalcified bone by placing the decalcified chicken bones into a jar of water with calcium supplements added. test the prediction by denaturing the collagen from the bones by baking them at 250c for three hours. analyze the data: create a table showing the changes in bone flexibility, strength, and mass in the three different environments. report the results: under which conditions was the bone most flexible? under which conditions was the bone the strongest? draw a conclusion: did the results support or refute the hypothesis? how do the results observed in this experiment correspond to diseases that destroy bone tissue? bone, or osseous tissue, is connective tissue that includes specialized cells, mineral salts, and collagen fibers. the human skeleton can be divided into long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones. compact bone tissue is composed of osteons and forms the external layer of all bones. spongy bone tissue is composed of trabeculae and forms the inner part of all bones. four types of cells compose bony tissue: osteocytes, osteoclasts, osteoprogenitor cells, and osteoblasts. ossification is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts. intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. long bones lengthen as chondrocytes divide and secrete hyaline cartilage.  osteoblasts replace cartilage with bone. appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bone tissue at the surface of bones. bone remodeling involves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. bone repair occurs in four stages and can take several months.","[('lamella', 'lamellaes', 'lamellae'), ('ossification', 'ossifications'), ('short bone', 'short bones'), ('osteon', 'osteons'), ('trabecula', 'trabeculas'), ('bone remodeling', 'bone remodelings'), ('compact bone tissue', 'compact bone tissues', 'compact bones tissue', 'compact bones tissues'), ('bone', 'bones'), ('bone cell', 'bone cells'), ('epiphyseal plate', 'epiphyseal plates'), ('appositional growth', 'appositional growths'), ('bone type', 'bone types'), ('decalcification', 'decalcifications'), ('diaphysi', 'diaphyses', 'diaphysis'), ('bone tissue', 'bone tissues'), ('irregular bone', 'irregular bones'), ('osteocyte', 'osteocytes'), ('calcification', 'calcifications'), ('haversian canal', 'haversian canals'), ('spongy bone tissue', 'spongy bone tissues', 'spongy bones tissue', 'spongy bones tissues'), ('endochondral ossification', 'endochondral ossifications'), ('osseous tissue', 'osseous tissues'), ('osteoclast', 'osteoclasts'), ('resorption', 'resorptions'), ('long bone', 'long bones'), ('musculoskeletal system', 'musculoskeletal systems'), ('intramembranous ossification', 'intramembranous ossifications'), ('osteoblast', 'osteoblasts'), ('bone growth', 'bone growths'), ('flat bone', 'flat bones'), ('epiphysis', 'epiphysess', 'epiphyses'), ('bone repair', 'bone repairs')]"
199,stax-bio,38,The Musculoskeletal System,3,m44786,Joints and Skeletal Movement,"the point at which two or more bones meet is called a joint, or articulation. joints are responsible for movement, such as the movement of limbs, and stability, such as the stability found in the bones of the skull. there are two ways to classify joints: on the basis of their structure or on the basis of their function. the structural classification divides joints into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending on the material composing the joint and the presence or absence of a cavity in the joint. the bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue. there is no cavity, or space, present between the bones and so most fibrous joints do not move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. there are three types of fibrous joints: sutures, syndesmoses, and gomphoses. sutures are found only in the skull and possess short fibers of connective tissue that hold the skull bones tightly in place ([link]). syndesmoses are joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue, allowing for more movement than in a suture. an example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle. the amount of movement in these types of joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers. gomphoses occur between teeth and their sockets; the term refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg ([link]). the tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue referred to as the periodontal ligament. cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. there are two types of cartilaginous joints: synchondroses and symphyses. in a synchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. in symphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage. symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae. either type of cartilaginous joint allows for very little movement. synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones ([link]). this space is referred to as the synovial (or joint) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid. synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones and allowing for greater movement. the ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage, and the entire joint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue that allows movement of the joint while resisting dislocation. articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together. synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint. knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of synovial joints. the functional classification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. a synarthrosis is a joint that is immovable. this includes sutures, gomphoses, and synchondroses. amphiarthroses are joints that allow slight movement, including syndesmoses and symphyses. diarthroses are joints that allow for free movement of the joint, as in synovial joints. the wide range of movement allowed by synovial joints produces different types of movements. the movement of synovial joints can be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement. gliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. gliding movements produce very little rotation or angular movement of the bones. the joints of the carpal and tarsal bones are examples of joints that produce gliding movements. angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. there are several different types of angular movements, including flexion, extension, hyperextension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction. flexion, or bending, occurs when the angle between the bones decreases. moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist to move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion. extension is the opposite of flexion in that the angle between the bones of a joint increases. straightening a limb after flexion is an example of extension. extension past the regular anatomical position is referred to as hyperextension. this includes moving the neck back to look upward, or bending the wrist so that the hand moves away from the forearm. abduction occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body. examples of abduction are moving the arms or legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side. adduction is the movement of a bone toward the midline of the body. movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction. circumduction is the movement of a limb in a circular motion, as in moving the arm in a circular motion. rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its longitudinal axis. rotation can be toward the midline of the body, which is referred to as medial rotation, or away from the midline of the body, which is referred to as lateral rotation. movement of the head from side to side is an example of rotation. some movements that cannot be classified as gliding, angular, or rotational are called special movements. inversion involves the soles of the feet moving inward, toward the midline of the body. eversion is the opposite of inversion, movement of the sole of the foot outward, away from the midline of the body. protraction is the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane. retraction occurs as a joint moves back into position after protraction. protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards. elevation is the movement of a bone upward, such as when the shoulders are shrugged, lifting the scapulae. depression is the opposite of elevationmovement downward of a bone, such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position. dorsiflexion is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee. plantar flexion is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted, such as when standing on the toes. supination is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward. pronation is the opposite movement, in which the palm faces backward. opposition is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand, making it possible to grasp and hold objects. synovial joints are further classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint. the shape of the joint affects the type of movement permitted by the joint ([link]). these joints can be described as planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, or ball-and-socket joints. planar joints have bones with articulating surfaces that are flat or slightly curved faces. these joints allow for gliding movements, and so the joints are sometimes referred to as gliding joints. the range of motion is limited in these joints and does not involve rotation. planar joints are found in the carpal bones in the hand and the tarsal bones of the foot, as well as between vertebrae ([link]). in hinge joints, the slightly rounded end of one bone fits into the slightly hollow end of the other bone. in this way, one bone moves while the other remains stationary, like the hinge of a door. the elbow is an example of a hinge joint. the knee is sometimes classified as a modified hinge joint ([link]). pivot joints consist of the rounded end of one bone fitting into a ring formed by the other bone. this structure allows rotational movement, as the rounded bone moves around its own axis. an example of a pivot joint is the joint of the first and second vertebrae of the neck that allows the head to move back and forth ([link]). the joint of the wrist that allows the palm of the hand to be turned up and down is also a pivot joint. condyloid joints consist of an oval-shaped end of one bone fitting into a similarly oval-shaped hollow of another bone ([link]). this is also sometimes called an ellipsoidal joint. this type of joint allows angular movement along two axes, as seen in the joints of the wrist and fingers, which can move both side to side and up and down. saddle joints are so named because the ends of each bone resemble a saddle, with concave and convex portions that fit together. saddle joints allow angular movements similar to condyloid joints but with a greater range of motion. an example of a saddle joint is the thumb joint, which can move back and forth and up and down, but more freely than the wrist or fingers ([link]). ball-and-socket joints possess a rounded, ball-like end of one bone fitting into a cuplike socket of another bone. this organization allows the greatest range of motion, as all movement types are possible in all directions. examples of ball-and-socket joints are the shoulder and hip joints ([link]). watch this animation showing the six types of synovial joints.

 rheumatologist
rheumatologists are medical doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the joints, muscles, and bones. they diagnose and treat diseases such as arthritis, musculoskeletal disorders, osteoporosis, and autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints of the hands, feet, and cervical spine. affected joints become swollen, stiff, and painful. although it is known that ra is an autoimmune disease in which the bodys immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, the cause of ra remains unknown. immune cells from the blood enter joints and the synovium causing cartilage breakdown, swelling, and inflammation of the joint lining. breakdown of cartilage causes bones to rub against each other causing pain. ra is more common in women than men and the age of onset is usually 4050 years of age. rheumatologists can diagnose ra on the basis of symptoms such as joint inflammation and pain, x-ray and mri imaging, and blood tests. arthrography is a type of medical imaging of joints that uses a contrast agent, such as a dye, that is opaque to x-rays. this allows the soft tissue structures of jointssuch as cartilage, tendons, and ligamentsto be visualized. an arthrogram differs from a regular x-ray by showing the surface of soft tissues lining the joint in addition to joint bones. an arthrogram allows early degenerative changes in joint cartilage to be detected before bones become affected. there is currently no cure for ra; however, rheumatologists have a number of treatment options available. early stages can be treated with rest of the affected joints by using a cane or by using joint splints that minimize inflammation. when inflammation has decreased, exercise can be used to strengthen the muscles that surround the joint and to maintain joint flexibility. if joint damage is more extensive, medications can be used to relieve pain and decrease inflammation. anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, topical pain relievers, and corticosteroid injections may be used. surgery may be required in cases in which joint damage is severe. the structural classification of joints divides them into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints. the bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue; the three types of fibrous joints are sutures, syndesomes, and gomphoses. cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage; the two types of cartilaginous joints are synchondroses and symphyses. synovial joints are joints that have a space between the adjoining bones. the functional classification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. the movement of synovial joints can be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement. gliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its own longitudinal axis. special movements include inversion, eversion, protraction, retraction, elevation, depression, dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, supination, pronation, and opposition. synovial joints are also classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint: planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket.","[('opposition', 'oppositions'), ('retraction', 'retractions'), ('fibrous joint', 'fibrous joints'), ('joint movement', 'joint movements'), ('synovial joint', 'synovial joints'), ('supination', 'supinations'), ('protraction', 'protractions'), ('ball-and-socket joint', 'ball-and-socket joints'), ('plantar flexion', 'plantar flexions'), ('inversion', 'inversions'), ('gomphose', 'gomphosess', 'gomphoses'), ('saddle joint', 'saddle joints'), ('dorsiflexion', 'dorsiflexions'), ('musculoskeletal system', 'musculoskeletal systems'), ('suture', 'sutures'), ('synchondrosi', 'synchondroses', 'synchondrosis'), ('angular movement', 'angular movements'), ('extension', 'extensions'), ('cartilaginous joint', 'cartilaginous joints'), ('joint structure', 'joint structures'), ('diarthrose', 'diarthrosess', 'diarthroses'), ('eversion', 'eversions'), ('flexion', 'flexions'), ('skeletal movement', 'skeletal movements'), ('circumduction', 'circumductions'), ('rheumatologist', 'rheumatologists'), ('symphysis', 'symphysess', 'symphyses'), ('joint function', 'joint functions'), ('lateral rotation', 'lateral rotations'), ('planar joint', 'planar joints'), ('syndesmosis', 'syndesmosess', 'syndesmoses'), ('pronation', 'pronations'), ('depression', 'depressions'), ('medial rotation', 'medial rotations'), ('joint', 'joints'), ('hinge joint', 'hinge joints'), ('pivot joint', 'pivot joints'), ('hyperextension', 'hyperextensions'), ('abduction', 'abductions'), ('adduction', 'adductions'), ('synarthrosi', 'synarthroses', 'synarthrosis'), ('condyloid joint', 'condyloid joints'), ('gliding movement', 'gliding movements'), ('rotational movement', 'rotational movements'), ('amphiarthrose', 'amphiarthrosess', 'amphiarthroses'), ('elevation', 'elevations')]"
200,stax-bio,38,The Musculoskeletal System,4,m44788,Muscle Contraction and Locomotion,"muscle cells are specialized for contraction. muscles allow for motions such as walking, and they also facilitate bodily processes such as respiration and digestion. the body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle ([link]). skeletal muscle tissue forms skeletal muscles, which attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and any movement that can be consciously controlled. because it can be controlled by thought, skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle. skeletal muscles are long and cylindrical in appearance; when viewed under a microscope, skeletal muscle tissue has a striped or striated appearance. the striations are caused by the regular arrangement of contractile proteins (actin and myosin). actin is a globular contractile protein that interacts with myosin for muscle contraction. skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei present in a single cell. smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels. smooth muscle has no striations, is not under voluntary control, has only one nucleus per cell, is tapered at both ends, and is called involuntary muscle. cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart, and cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body and maintain blood pressure. like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be consciously controlled and is called involuntary muscle. it has one nucleus per cell, is branched, and is distinguished by the presence of intercalated disks. each skeletal muscle fiber is a skeletal muscle cell. these cells are incredibly large, with diameters of up to 100  m and lengths of up to 30 cm. the plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is called the sarcolemma. the sarcolemma is the site of action potential conduction, which triggers muscle contraction. within each muscle fiber are myofibrilslong cylindrical structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber. myofibrils run the entire length of the muscle fiber, and because they are only approximately 1.2  m in diameter, hundreds to thousands can be found inside one muscle fiber. they attach to the sarcolemma at their ends, so that as myofibrils shorten, the entire muscle cell contracts ([link]). the striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue is a result of repeating bands of the proteins actin and myosin that are present along the length of myofibrils. dark a bands and light i bands repeat along myofibrils, and the alignment of myofibrils in the cell causes the entire cell to appear striated or banded. each i band has a dense line running vertically through the middle called a z disc or z line. the z discs mark the border of units called sarcomeres, which are the functional units of skeletal muscle. one sarcomere is the space between two consecutive z discs and contains one entire a band and two halves of an i band, one on either side of the a band. a myofibril is composed of many sarcomeres running along its length, and as the sarcomeres individually contract, the myofibrils and muscle cells shorten ([link]). myofibrils are composed of smaller structures called myofilaments. there are two main types of filaments: thick filaments and thin filaments; each has different compositions and locations. thick filaments occur only in the a band of a myofibril. thin filaments attach to a protein in the z disc called alpha-actinin and occur across the entire length of the i band and partway into the a band. the region at which thick and thin filaments overlap has a dense appearance, as there is little space between the filaments. thin filaments do not extend all the way into the a bands, leaving a central region of the a band that only contains thick filaments. this central region of the a band looks slightly lighter than the rest of the a band and is called the h zone. the middle of the h zone has a vertical line called the m line, at which accessory proteins hold together thick filaments. both the z disc and the m line hold myofilaments in place to maintain the structural arrangement and layering of the myofibril. myofibrils are connected to each other by intermediate, or desmin, filaments that attach to the z disc. thick and thin filaments are themselves composed of proteins. thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin. the tail of a myosin molecule connects with other myosin molecules to form the central region of a thick filament near the m line, whereas the heads align on either side of the thick filament where the thin filaments overlap. the primary component of thin filaments is the actin protein. two other components of the thin filament are tropomyosin and troponin. actin has binding sites for myosin attachment. strands of tropomyosin block the binding sites and prevent actinmyosin interactions when the muscles are at rest. troponin consists of three globular subunits. one subunit binds to tropomyosin, one subunit binds to actin, and one subunit binds ca2+ ions. view this animation showing the organization of muscle fibers.

 for a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten. however, thick and thin filamentsthe components of sarcomeresdo not shorten. instead, they slide by one another, causing the sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain the same length. the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was developed to fit the differences observed in the named bands on the sarcomere at different degrees of muscle contraction and relaxation. the mechanism of contraction is the binding of myosin to actin, forming cross-bridges that generate filament movement ([link]). when a sarcomere shortens, some regions shorten whereas others stay the same length. a sarcomere is defined as the distance between two consecutive z discs or z lines; when a muscle contracts, the distance between the z discs is reduced. the h zonethe central region of the a zonecontains only thick filaments and is shortened during contraction. the i band contains only thin filaments and also shortens. the a band does not shortenit remains the same lengthbut a bands of different sarcomeres move closer together during contraction, eventually disappearing. thin filaments are pulled by the thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere until the z discs approach the thick filaments. the zone of overlap, in which thin filaments and thick filaments occupy the same area, increases as the thin filaments move inward. the motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to actin and pull the actin inwards. this action requires energy, which is provided by atp. myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein. myosin has another binding site for atp at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes atp to adp, releasing an inorganic phosphate molecule and energy. atp binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other. after this happens, the newly bound atp is converted to adp and inorganic phosphate, pi. the enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called atpase. the energy released during atp hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin head into a cocked position. the myosin head is then in a position for further movement, possessing potential energy, but adp and pi are still attached.  if actin binding sites are covered and unavailable, the myosin will remain in the high energy configuration with atp hydrolyzed, but still attached. if the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the actin and myosin molecules. pi is then released, allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as a conformational change. the myosin head moves toward the m line, pulling the actin along with it. as the actin is pulled, the filaments move approximately 10 nm toward the m line. this movement is called the power stroke, as it is the step at which force is produced. as the actin is pulled toward the m line, the sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts. when the myosin head is cocked, it contains energy and is in a high-energy configuration. this energy is expended as the myosin head moves through the power stroke; at the end of the power stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position. after the power stroke, adp is released; however, the cross-bridge formed is still in place, and actin and myosin are bound together. atp can then attach to myosin, which allows the cross-bridge cycle to start again and further muscle contraction can occur ([link]). watch this video explaining how a muscle contraction is signaled.

 when a muscle is in a resting state, actin and myosin are separated. to keep actin from binding to the active site on myosin, regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites. tropomyosin blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules, preventing cross-bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle without nervous input. troponin binds to tropomyosin and helps to position it on the actin molecule; it also binds calcium ions. to enable a muscle contraction, tropomyosin must change conformation, uncovering the myosin-binding site on an actin molecule and allowing cross-bridge formation. this can only happen in the presence of calcium, which is kept at extremely low concentrations in the sarcoplasm. if present, calcium ions bind to troponin, causing conformational changes in troponin that allow tropomyosin to move away from the myosin binding sites on actin. once the tropomyosin is removed, a cross-bridge can form between actin and myosin, triggering contraction. cross-bridge cycling continues until ca2+ ions and atp are no longer available and tropomyosin again covers the binding sites on actin. excitationcontraction coupling is the link (transduction) between the action potential generated in the sarcolemma and the start of a muscle contraction. the trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural signal. each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron, which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to the muscle. the area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that interacts with the neuron is called the motor end plate. the end of the neurons axon is called the synaptic terminal, and it does not actually contact the motor end plate. a small space called the synaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the motor end plate. electrical signals travel along the neurons axon, which branches through the muscle and connects to individual muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction. the ability of cells to communicate electrically requires that the cells expend energy to create an electrical gradient across their cell membranes.  this charge gradient is carried by ions, which are differentially distributed across the membrane.  each ion exerts an electrical influence and a concentration influence.  just as milk will eventually mix with coffee without the need to stir, ions also distribute themselves evenly, if they are permitted to do so.  in this case, they are not permitted to return to an evenly mixed state. the sodiumpotassium atpase uses cellular energy to move k+ ions inside the cell and na+ ions outside. this alone accumulates a small electrical charge, but a big concentration gradient. there is lots of k+ in the cell and lots of na+ outside the cell. potassium is able to leave the cell through k+ channels that are open 90% of the time, and it does. however, na+ channels are rarely open, so na+ remains outside the cell.   when k+ leaves the cell, obeying its concentration gradient, that effectively leaves a negative charge behind. so at rest, there is a large concentration gradient for na+ to enter the cell, and there is an accumulation of negative charges left behind in the cell. this is the resting membrane potential. potential in this context means a separation of electrical charge that is capable of doing work. it is measured in volts, just like a battery. however, the transmembrane potential is considerably smaller (0.07 v); therefore, the small value is expressed as millivolts (mv) or 70 mv. because the inside of a cell is negative compared with the outside, a minus sign signifies the excess of negative charges inside the cell,  70 mv. if an event changes the permeability of the membrane to na+ ions, they will enter the cell. that will change the voltage. this is an electrical event, called an action potential, that can be used as a cellular signal. communication occurs between nerves and muscles through neurotransmitters. neuron action potentials cause the release of neurotransmitters from the synaptic terminal into the synaptic cleft, where they can then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor molecule on the motor end plate. the motor end plate possesses junctional foldsfolds in the sarcolemma that create a large surface area for the neurotransmitter to bind to receptors. the receptors are actually sodium channels that open to allow the passage of na+ into the cell when they receive neurotransmitter signal. acetylcholine (ach) is a neurotransmitter released by motor neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end plate. neurotransmitter release occurs when an action potential travels down the motor neurons axon, resulting in altered permeability of the synaptic terminal membrane and an influx of calcium. the ca2+ ions allow synaptic vesicles to move to and bind with the presynaptic membrane (on the neuron), and release neurotransmitter from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft. once released by the synaptic terminal, ach diffuses across the synaptic cleft to the motor end plate, where it binds with ach receptors. as a neurotransmitter binds, these ion channels open, and na+ ions cross the membrane into the muscle cell. this reduces the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell, which is called depolarization. as ach binds at the motor end plate, this depolarization is called an end-plate potential. the depolarization then spreads along the sarcolemma, creating an action potential as sodium channels adjacent to the initial depolarization site sense the change in voltage and open. the action potential moves across the entire cell, creating a wave of depolarization. ach is broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (ache) into acetyl and choline. ache resides in the synaptic cleft, breaking down ach so that it does not remain bound to ach receptors, which would cause unwanted extended muscle contraction ([link]). after depolarization, the membrane returns to its resting state. this is called repolarization, during which voltage-gated sodium channels close. potassium channels continue at 90% conductance. because the plasma membrane sodiumpotassium atpase always transports ions, the resting state (negatively charged inside relative to the outside) is restored. the period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse, is called the refractory period. during the refractory period, the membrane cannot generate another action potential. . the refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to return to their resting configurations. the sodium potassium atpase continually moves na+ back out of the cell and k+ back into the cell, and the k+ leaks out leaving negative charge behind. very quickly, the membrane repolarizes, so that it can again be depolarized. neural control initiates the formation of actinmyosin cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening involved in muscle contraction. these contractions extend from the muscle fiber through connective tissue to pull on bones, causing skeletal movement. the pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the amount of force created by this tension can vary. this enables the same muscles to move very light objects and very heavy objects. in individual muscle fibers, the amount of tension produced depends on the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber and the frequency of neural stimulation. the number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin determine the amount of tension that a muscle fiber can produce. cross-bridges can only form where thick and thin filaments overlap, allowing myosin to bind to actin. if more cross-bridges are formed, more myosin will pull on actin, and more tension will be produced. the ideal length of a sarcomere during production of maximal tension occurs when thick and thin filaments overlap to the greatest degree. if a sarcomere at rest is stretched past an ideal resting length, thick and thin filaments do not overlap to the greatest degree, and fewer cross-bridges can form. this results in fewer myosin heads pulling on actin, and less tension is produced. as a sarcomere is shortened, the zone of overlap is reduced as the thin filaments reach the h zone, which is composed of myosin tails. because it is myosin heads that form cross-bridges, actin will not bind to myosin in this zone, reducing the tension produced by this myofiber. if the sarcomere is shortened even more, thin filaments begin to overlap with each otherreducing cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less tension. conversely, if the sarcomere is stretched to the point at which thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges are formed and no tension is produced. this amount of stretching does not usually occur because accessory proteins, internal sensory nerves, and connective tissue oppose extreme stretching. the primary variable determining force production is the number of myofibers within the muscle that receive an action potential from the neuron that controls that fiber.  when using the biceps to pick up a pencil, the motor cortex of the brain only signals a few neurons of the biceps, and only a few myofibers respond.  in vertebrates, each myofiber responds fully if stimulated.  when picking up a piano, the motor cortex signals all of the neurons in the biceps and every myofiber participates.  this is close to the maximum force the muscle can produce.  as mentioned above, increasing the frequency of action potentials (the number of signals per second) can increase the force a bit more, because the tropomyosin is flooded with calcium. the body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. skeleton muscle tissue is composed of sarcomeres, the functional units of muscle tissue. muscle contraction occurs when sarcomeres shorten, as thick and thin filaments slide past each other, which is called the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. atp provides the energy for cross-bridge formation and filament sliding. regulatory proteins, such as troponin and tropomyosin, control cross-bridge formation. excitationcontraction coupling transduces the electrical signal of the neuron, via acetylcholine, to an electrical signal on the muscle membrane, which initiates force production. the number of muscle fibers contracting determines how much force the whole muscle produces.","[('cardiac muscle tissue', 'cardiac muscle tissues', 'cardiac muscles tissue', 'cardiac muscles tissues'), ('tropomyosin',

201,stax-bio,39,The Respiratory System,0,m44790,Introduction,"breathing is an involuntary event. how often a breath is taken and how much air is inhaled or exhaled are tightly regulated by the respiratory center in the brain. humans, when they arent exerting themselves, breathe approximately 15 times per minute on average. canines, like the dog in [link], have a respiratory rate of about 1530 breaths per minute. with every inhalation, air fills the lungs, and with every exhalation, air rushes back out. that air is doing more than just inflating and deflating the lungs in the chest cavity. the air contains oxygen that crosses the lung tissue, enters the bloodstream, and travels to organs and tissues. oxygen (o2) enters the cells where it is used for metabolic reactions that produce atp, a high-energy compound. at the same time, these reactions release carbon dioxide (co2) as a by-product. co2 is toxic and must be eliminated. carbon dioxide exits the cells, enters the bloodstream, travels back to the lungs, and is expired out of the body during exhalation.","[('functional vital capacity', 'functional vital capacities'), ('boyle law', 'boyle laws'), ('oxygen',

202,stax-bio,39,The Respiratory System,1,m44792,Systems of Gas Exchange,"the primary function of the respiratory system is to deliver oxygen to the cells of the bodys tissues and remove carbon dioxide, a cell waste product. the main structures of the human respiratory system are the nasal cavity, the trachea, and lungs. all aerobic organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic functions. along the evolutionary tree, different organisms have devised different means of obtaining oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere. the environment in which the animal lives greatly determines how an animal respires. the complexity of the respiratory system is correlated with the size of the organism. as animal size increases, diffusion distances increase and the ratio of surface area to volume drops. in unicellular organisms, diffusion across the cell membrane is sufficient for supplying oxygen to the cell ([link]). diffusion is a slow, passive transport process. in order for diffusion to be a feasible means of providing oxygen to the cell, the rate of oxygen uptake must match the rate of diffusion across the membrane. in other words, if the cell were very large or thick, diffusion would not be able to provide oxygen quickly enough to the inside of the cell. therefore, dependence on diffusion as a means of obtaining oxygen and removing carbon dioxide remains feasible only for small organisms or those with highly-flattened bodies, such as many flatworms (platyhelminthes). larger organisms had to evolve specialized respiratory tissues, such as gills, lungs, and respiratory passages accompanied by complex circulatory systems, to transport oxygen throughout their entire body.  for small multicellular organisms, diffusion across the outer membrane is sufficient to meet their oxygen needs. gas exchange by direct diffusion across surface membranes is efficient for organisms less than 1 mm in diameter. in simple organisms, such as cnidarians and flatworms, every cell in the body is close to the external environment. their cells are kept moist and gases diffuse quickly via direct diffusion. flatworms are small, literally flat worms, which breathe through diffusion across the outer membrane ([link]). the flat shape of these organisms increases the surface area for diffusion, ensuring that each cell within the body is close to the outer membrane surface and has access to oxygen. if the flatworm had a cylindrical body, then the cells in the center would not be able to get oxygen. earthworms and amphibians use their skin (integument) as a respiratory organ. a dense network of capillaries lies just below the skin and facilitates gas exchange between the external environment and the circulatory system. the respiratory surface must be kept moist in order for the gases to dissolve and diffuse across cell membranes. organisms that live in water need to obtain oxygen from the water. oxygen dissolves in water but at a lower concentration than in the atmosphere. the atmosphere has roughly 21 percent oxygen. in water, the oxygen concentration is much smaller than that. fish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up the dissolved oxygen from water ([link]). gills are thin tissue filaments that are highly branched and folded. when water passes over the gills, the dissolved oxygen in water rapidly diffuses across the gills into the bloodstream. the circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated blood to the other parts of the body. in animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood, oxygen diffuses across the gill surfaces into the coelomic fluid. gills are found in mollusks, annelids, and crustaceans. the folded surfaces of the gills provide a large surface area to ensure that the fish gets sufficient oxygen. diffusion is a process in which material travels from regions of high concentration to low concentration until equilibrium is reached. in this case, blood with a low concentration of oxygen molecules circulates through the gills. the concentration of oxygen molecules in water is higher than the concentration of oxygen molecules in gills. as a result, oxygen molecules diffuse from water (high concentration) to blood (low concentration), as shown in [link]. similarly, carbon dioxide molecules in the blood diffuse from the blood (high concentration) to water (low concentration). insect respiration is independent of its circulatory system; therefore, the blood does not play a direct role in oxygen transport. insects have a highly specialized type of respiratory system called the tracheal system, which consists of a network of small tubes that carries oxygen to the entire body. the tracheal system is the most direct and efficient respiratory system in active animals. the tubes in the tracheal system are made of a polymeric material called chitin. insect bodies have openings, called spiracles, along the thorax and abdomen. these openings connect to the tubular network, allowing oxygen to pass into the body ([link]) and regulating the diffusion of co2 and water vapor. air enters and leaves the tracheal system through the spiracles. some insects can ventilate the tracheal system with body movements. in mammals, pulmonary ventilation occurs via inhalation (breathing). during inhalation, air enters the body through the nasal cavity located just inside the nose ([link]). as air passes through the nasal cavity, the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified. the respiratory tract is coated with mucus to seal the tissues from direct contact with air. mucus is high in water. as air crosses these surfaces of the mucous membranes, it picks up water. these processes help equilibrate the air to the body conditions, reducing any damage that cold, dry air can cause. particulate matter that is floating in the air is removed in the nasal passages via mucus and cilia. the processes of warming, humidifying, and removing particles are important protective mechanisms that prevent damage to the trachea and lungs. thus, inhalation serves several purposes in addition to bringing oxygen into the respiratory system. from the nasal cavity, air passes through the pharynx (throat) and the larynx (voice box), as it makes its way to the trachea ([link]). the main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body. the human trachea is a cylinder about 10 to 12 cm long and 2 cm in diameter that sits in front of the esophagus and extends from the larynx into the chest cavity where it divides into the two primary bronchi at the midthorax. it is made of incomplete rings of hyaline cartilage and smooth muscle ([link]). the trachea is lined with mucus-producing goblet cells and ciliated epithelia. the cilia propel foreign particles trapped in the mucus toward the pharynx. the cartilage provides strength and support to the trachea to keep the passage open. the smooth muscle can contract, decreasing the tracheas diameter, which causes expired air to rush upwards from the lungs at a great force. the forced exhalation helps expel mucus when we cough. smooth muscle can contract or relax, depending on stimuli from the external environment or the bodys nervous system. the end of the trachea bifurcates (divides) to the right and left lungs. the lungs are not identical. the right lung is larger and contains three lobes, whereas the smaller left lung contains two lobes ([link]). the muscular diaphragm, which facilitates breathing, is inferior to (below) the lungs and marks the end of the thoracic cavity. in the lungs, air is diverted into smaller and smaller passages, or bronchi. air enters the lungs through the two primary (main) bronchi (singular: bronchus). each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi, then into tertiary bronchi, which in turn divide, creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung. like the trachea, the bronchi are made of cartilage and smooth muscle. at the bronchioles, the cartilage is replaced with elastic fibers. bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction (parasympathetic) or relaxation (sympathetic) in the bronchi and bronchioles, depending on the nervous systems cues. in humans, bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the respiratory bronchioles. they lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape. as the passageways decrease in diameter, the relative amount of smooth muscle increases. the terminal bronchioles subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles. the respiratory bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts. numerous alveoli and alveolar sacs surround the alveolar ducts. the alveolar sacs resemble bunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles ([link]). in the acinar region, the alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each bronchiole. at the end of each duct are approximately 100 alveolar sacs, each containing 20 to 30 alveoli that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter. gas exchange occurs only in alveoli. alveoli are made of thin-walled parenchymal cells, typically one-cell thick, that look like tiny bubbles within the sacs. alveoli are in direct contact with capillaries (one-cell thick) of the circulatory system. such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from alveoli into the blood and be distributed to the cells of the body. in addition, the carbon dioxide that was produced by cells as a waste product will diffuse from the blood into alveoli to be exhaled. the anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli emphasizes the structural and functional relationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems. because there are so many alveoli (~300 million per lung) within each alveolar sac and so many sacs at the end of each alveolar duct, the lungs have a sponge-like consistency. this organization produces a very large surface area that is available for gas exchange. the surface area of alveoli in the lungs is approximately 75 m2. this large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the alveolar parenchymal cells, allows gases to easily diffuse across the cells. watch the following video to review the respiratory system.
 the air that organisms breathe contains particulate matter such as dust, dirt, viral particles, and bacteria that can damage the lungs or trigger allergic immune responses. the respiratory system contains several protective mechanisms to avoid problems or tissue damage. in the nasal cavity, hairs and mucus trap small particles, viruses, bacteria, dust, and dirt to prevent their entry. if particulates do make it beyond the nose, or enter through the mouth, the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs also contain several protective devices. the lungs produce mucusa sticky substance made of mucin, a complex glycoprotein, as well as salts and waterthat traps particulates. the bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia, small hair-like projections that line the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles ([link]). these cilia beat in unison and move mucus and particles out of the bronchi and bronchioles back up to the throat where it is swallowed and eliminated via the esophagus. in humans, for example, tar and other substances in cigarette smoke destroy or paralyze the cilia, making the removal of particles more difficult. in addition, smoking causes the lungs to produce more mucus, which the damaged cilia are not able to move. this causes a persistent cough, as the lungs try to rid themselves of particulate matter, and makes smokers more susceptible to respiratory ailments. animal respiratory systems are designed to facilitate gas exchange. in mammals, air is warmed and humidified in the nasal cavity. air then travels down the pharynx, through the trachea, and into the lungs. in the lungs, air passes through the branching bronchi, reaching the respiratory bronchioles, which house the first site of gas exchange. the respiratory bronchioles open into the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. because there are so many alveoli and alveolar sacs in the lung, the surface area for gas exchange is very large. several protective mechanisms are in place to prevent damage or infection. these include the hair and mucus in the nasal cavity that trap dust, dirt, and other particulate matter before they can enter the system. in the lungs, particles are trapped in a mucus layer and transported via cilia up to the esophageal opening at the top of the trachea to be swallowed.","[('gill', 'gillss', 'gills'), ('alveolar duct', 'alveolar ducts'), ('acini', 'acinis'), ('muc protein', 'muc proteins'), ('flatworm', 'flatworms'), ('particulate matter', 'particulate matters'), ('alveolar sac', 'alveolar sacs'), ('trachea', 'tracheas'), ('chitin', 'chitins'), ('mucu', 'mucuss', 'mucus'), ('smooth muscle', 'smooth muscles'), ('tracheal system', 'tracheal systems'), ('respiratory bronchiole', 'respiratory bronchioles'), ('cilium', 'cilias', 'cilia'), ('alveoli', 'alveolis'), ('larynx', 'larynges'), ('primary bronchu', 'primary bronchuss', 'primary bronchus'), ('bronchu', 'bronchuss', 'bronchus'), ('terminal bronchiole', 'terminal bronchioles'), ('direct diffusion', 'direct diffusions'), ('pharynx', 'pharynges'), ('alveolu', 'alveoluss', 'alveolus'), ('bronchiole', 'bronchioles'), ('nasal cavity', 'nasal cavities'), ('diffusion', 'diffusions'), ('air sac', 'air sacss', 'air sacs'), ('diaphragm', 'diaphragms'), ('cartilage', 'cartilages'), ('acinu', 'acinuss', 'acinus'), ('mucin', 'mucins'), ('bronchi', 'bronchis'), ('main bronchu', 'main bronchuss', 'main bronchus'), ('ventricarium ventricosa', 'ventricarium ventricosas')]"
203,stax-bio,39,The Respiratory System,2,m44795,Gas Exchange across Respiratory Surfaces,"the structure of the lung maximizes its surface area to increase gas diffusion. because of the enormous number of alveoli (approximately 300 million in each human lung), the surface area of the lung is very large (75 m2). having such a large surface area increases the amount of gas that can diffuse into and out of the lungs. gas exchange during respiration occurs primarily through diffusion. diffusion is a process in which transport is driven by a concentration gradient. gas molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. blood that is low in oxygen concentration and high in carbon dioxide concentration undergoes gas exchange with air in the lungs. the air in the lungs has a higher concentration of oxygen than that of oxygen-depleted blood and a lower concentration of carbon dioxide. this concentration gradient allows for gas exchange during respiration.  partial pressure is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases. the total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture. the rate of diffusion of a gas is proportional to its partial pressure within the total gas mixture. this concept is discussed further in detail below. different animals have different lung capacities based on their activities. cheetahs have evolved a much higher lung capacity than humans; it helps provide oxygen to all the muscles in the body and allows them to run very fast. elephants also have a high lung capacity. in this case, it is not because they run fast but because they have a large body and must be able to take up oxygen in accordance with their body size. human lung size is determined by genetics, sex, and height. at maximal capacity, an average lung can hold almost six liters of air, but lungs do not usually operate at maximal capacity. air in the lungs is measured in terms of lung volumes and lung capacities ([link] and [link]). volume measures the amount of air for one function (such as inhalation or exhalation). capacity is any two or more volumes (for example, how much can be inhaled from the end of a maximal exhalation). the volume in the lung can be divided into four units: tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume, inspiratory reserve volume, and residual volume. tidal volume (tv) measures the amount of air that is inspired and expired during a normal breath. on average, this volume is around one-half liter, which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle. the expiratory reserve volume (erv) is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation. it is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal. conversely, the inspiratory reserve volume (irv) is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation. the residual volume (rv) is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled. the lungs are never completely empty: there is always some air left in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. if this residual volume did not exist and the lungs emptied completely, the lung tissues would stick together and the energy necessary to re-inflate the lung could be too great to overcome. therefore, there is always some air remaining in the lungs. residual volume is also important for preventing large fluctuations in respiratory gases (o2 and co2). the residual volume is the only lung volume that cannot be measured directly because it is impossible to completely empty the lung of air. this volume can only be calculated rather than measured. capacities are measurements of two or more volumes. the vital capacity (vc) measures the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle. it is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve volume. the inspiratory capacity (ic) is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal expiration. it is, therefore, the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume. the functional residual capacity (frc) includes the expiratory reserve volume and the residual volume. the frc measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation. lastly, the total lung capacity (tlc) is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold. it is the sum of the residual volume, expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve volume. lung volumes are measured by a technique called spirometry. an important measurement taken during spirometry is the forced expiratory volume (fev), which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period, usually one second (fev1). in addition, the forced vital capacity (fvc), which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled, is measured. the ratio of these values (fev1/fvc ratio) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma, emphysema, and fibrosis. if the fev1/fvc ratio is high, the lungs are not compliant (meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly), and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis. patients exhale most of the lung volume very quickly. conversely, when the fev1/fvc ratio is low, there is resistance in the lung that is characteristic of asthma. in this instance, it is hard for the patient to get the air out of his or her lungs, and it takes a long time to reach the maximal exhalation volume. in either case, breathing is difficult and complications arise. 
respiratory therapists or respiratory practitioners evaluate and treat patients with lung and cardiovascular diseases. they work as part of a medical team to develop treatment plans for patients. respiratory therapists may treat premature babies with underdeveloped lungs, patients with chronic conditions such as asthma, or older patients suffering from lung disease such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). they may operate advanced equipment such as compressed gas delivery systems, ventilators, blood gas analyzers, and resuscitators. specialized programs to become a respiratory therapist generally lead to a bachelors degree with a respiratory therapist specialty. because of a growing aging population, career opportunities as a respiratory therapist are expected to remain strong. the respiratory process can be better understood by examining the properties of gases. gases move freely, but gas particles are constantly hitting the walls of their vessel, thereby producing gas pressure. air is a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen (n2; 78.6 percent), oxygen (o2; 20.9 percent), water vapor (h2o; 0.5 percent), and carbon dioxide (co2; 0.04 percent). each gas component of that mixture exerts a pressure. the pressure for an individual gas in the mixture is the partial pressure of that gas. approximately 21 percent of atmospheric gas is oxygen. carbon dioxide, however, is found in relatively small amounts, 0.04 percent. the partial pressure for oxygen is much greater than that of carbon dioxide. the partial pressure of any gas can be calculated by: patm, the atmospheric pressure, is the sum of all of the partial pressures of the atmospheric gases added together,  (percent content in mixture). the pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 760 mm hg. therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen is: and for carbon dioxide: at high altitudes, patm decreases but concentration does not change; the partial pressure decrease is due to the reduction in patm. when the air mixture reaches the lung, it has been humidified. the pressure of the water vapor in the lung does not change the pressure of the air, but it must be included in the partial pressure equation. for this calculation, the water pressure (47 mm hg) is subtracted from the atmospheric pressure: and the partial pressure of oxygen is: these pressures determine the gas exchange, or the flow of gas, in the system. oxygen and carbon dioxide will flow according to their pressure gradient from high to low. therefore, understanding the partial pressure of each gas will aid in understanding how gases move in the respiratory system. in the body, oxygen is used by cells of the bodys tissues and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product. the ratio of carbon dioxide production to oxygen consumption is the respiratory quotient (rq). rq varies between 0.7 and 1.0. if just glucose were used to fuel the body, the rq would equal one. one mole of carbon dioxide would be produced for every mole of oxygen consumed. glucose, however, is not the only fuel for the body. protein and fat are also used as fuels for the body. because of this, less carbon dioxide is produced than oxygen is consumed and the rq is, on average, about 0.7 for fat and about 0.8 for protein. the rq is used to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar spaces within the lung, the alveolar

 above, the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs was calculated to be 150 mm hg. however, lungs never fully deflate with an exhalation; therefore, the inspired air mixes with this residual air and lowers the partial pressure of oxygen within the alveoli. this means that there is a lower concentration of oxygen in the lungs than is found in the air outside the body. knowing the rq, the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli can be calculated: with an rq of 0.8 and a

 ([link]). in the lungs, oxygen diffuses out of the alveoli and into the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. oxygen (about 98 percent) binds reversibly to the respiratory pigment hemoglobin found in red blood cells (rbcs). rbcs carry oxygen to the tissues where oxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells of the tissues. more specifically, alveolar

 the lungs can hold a large volume of air, but they are not usually filled to maximal capacity. lung volume measurements include tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume, inspiratory reserve volume, and residual volume. the sum of these equals the total lung capacity. gas movement into or out of the lungs is dependent on the pressure of the gas. air is a mixture of gases; therefore, the partial pressure of each gas can be calculated to determine how the gas will flow in the lung. the difference between the partial pressure of the gas in the air drives oxygen into the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.","[('inspiratory capacity', 'inspiratory capacities'), ('carbon dioxide', 'carbon dioxides'), ('concentration gradient', 'concentration gradients'), ('oxygen', 'oxygens'), ('respiratory quotient', 'respiratory quotients'), ('vital capacity', 'vital capacities'), ('maximal exhalation', 'maximal exhalations'), ('lung volume', 'lung volumes'), ('functional residual capacity', 'functional residual capacities'), ('residual volume', 'residual volumes'), ('hemoglobin', 'hemoglobins'), ('total lung capacity', 'total lung capacities', 'total lungs capacity', 'total lungs capacities'), ('forced expiratory volume', 'forced expiratory volumes', 'forced expiratories volume', 'forced expiratories volumes'), ('ga exchange', 'ga exchanges'), ('inspiratory reserve volume', 'inspiratory reserve volumes', 'inspiratory reserves volume', 'inspiratory reserves volumes'), ('expiratory reserve volume', 'expiratory reserve volumes', 'expiratory reserves volume', 'expiratory reserves volumes'), ('partial pressure', 'partial pressures'), ('tidal volume', 'tidal volumes'), ('spirometry', 'spirometries'), ('diffusion', 'diffusions'), ('ga equation', 'ga equations'), ('fev1/fvc ratio', 'fev1/fvc ratios'), ('lung capacity', 'lung capacities'), ('respiratory therapist', 'respiratory therapists'), ('forced vital capacity', 'forced vital capacities'), ('ga pressure', 'ga pressures')]"
204,stax-bio,39,The Respiratory System,3,m44797,Breathing,"mammalian lungs are located in the thoracic cavity where they are surrounded and protected by the rib cage, intercostal muscles, and bound by the chest wall. the bottom of the lungs is contained by the diaphragm, a skeletal muscle that facilitates breathing. breathing requires the coordination of the lungs, the chest wall, and most importantly, the diaphragm. amphibians have evolved multiple ways of breathing. young amphibians, like tadpoles, use gills to breathe, and they dont leave the water. some amphibians retain gills for life. as the tadpole grows, the gills disappear and lungs grow. these lungs are primitive and not as evolved as mammalian lungs. adult amphibians are lacking or have a reduced diaphragm, so breathing via lungs is forced. the other means of breathing for amphibians is diffusion across the skin. to aid this diffusion, amphibian skin must remain moist. birds face a unique challenge with respect to breathing: they fly. flying consumes a great amount of energy; therefore, birds require a lot of oxygen to aid their metabolic processes. birds have evolved a respiratory system that supplies them with the oxygen needed to enable flying. similar to mammals, birds have lungs, which are organs specialized for gas exchange. oxygenated air, taken in during inhalation, diffuses across the surface of the lungs into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs and expelled during exhalation. the details of breathing between birds and mammals differ substantially. in addition to lungs, birds have air sacs inside their body. air flows in one direction from the posterior air sacs to the lungs and out of the anterior air sacs. the flow of air is in the opposite direction from blood flow, and gas exchange takes place much more efficiently. this type of breathing enables birds to obtain the requisite oxygen, even at higher altitudes where the oxygen concentration is low. this directionality of airflow requires two cycles of air intake and exhalation to completely get the air out of the lungs. avian respiration
birds have evolved a respiratory system that enables them to fly. flying is a high-energy process and requires a lot of oxygen. furthermore, many birds fly in high altitudes where the concentration of oxygen in low. how did birds evolve a respiratory system that is so unique? decades of research by paleontologists have shown that birds evolved from therapods, meat-eating dinosaurs ([link]). in fact, fossil evidence shows that meat-eating dinosaurs that lived more than 100 million years ago had a similar flow-through respiratory system with lungs and air sacs. archaeopteryx and xiaotingia, for example, were flying dinosaurs and are believed to be early precursors of birds. most of us consider that dinosaurs are extinct. however, modern birds are descendants of avian dinosaurs. the respiratory system of modern birds has been evolving for hundreds of millions of years. all mammals have lungs that are the main organs for breathing. lung capacity has evolved to support the animals activities. during inhalation, the lungs expand with air, and oxygen diffuses across the lungs surface and enters the bloodstream. during exhalation, the lungs expel air and lung volume decreases. in the next few sections, the process of human breathing will be explained. boyles law is the gas law that states that in a closed space, pressure and volume are inversely related. as volume decreases, pressure increases and vice versa ([link]). the relationship between gas pressure and volume helps to explain the mechanics of breathing. there is always a slightly negative pressure within the thoracic cavity, which aids in keeping the airways of the lungs open. during inhalation, volume increases as a result of contraction of the diaphragm, and pressure decreases (according to boyles law). this decrease of pressure in the thoracic cavity relative to the environment makes the cavity less than the atmosphere ([link]a). because of this drop in pressure, air rushes into the respiratory passages. to increase the volume of the lungs, the chest wall expands. this results from the contraction of the intercostal muscles, the muscles that are connected to the rib cage. lung volume expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostals muscles contract, thus expanding the thoracic cavity. this increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity lowers pressure compared to the atmosphere, so air rushes into the lungs, thus increasing its volume. the resulting increase in volume is largely attributed to an increase in alveolar space, because the bronchioles and bronchi are stiff structures that do not change in size. the chest wall expands out and away from the lungs. the lungs are elastic; therefore, when air fills the lungs, the elastic recoil within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs. these outward and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath. upon exhalation, the lungs recoil to force the air out of the lungs, and the intercostal muscles relax, returning the chest wall back to its original position ([link]b). the diaphragm also relaxes and moves higher into the thoracic cavity. this increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity relative to the environment, and air rushes out of the lungs. the movement of air out of the lungs is a passive event. no muscles are contracting to expel the air. each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac. the layer of tissue that covers the lung and dips into spaces is called the visceral pleura. a second layer of parietal pleura lines the interior of the thorax ([link]). the space between these layers, the intrapleural space, contains a small amount of fluid that protects the tissue and reduces the friction generated from rubbing the tissue layers together as the lungs contract and relax. pleurisy results when these layers of tissue become inflamed; it is painful because the inflammation increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity and reduces the volume of the lung. view how boyles law is related to breathing and watch a video on boyles law.

 the number of breaths per minute is the respiratory rate. on average, under non-exertion conditions, the human respiratory rate is 1215 breaths/minute. the respiratory rate contributes to the alveolar ventilation, or how much air moves into and out of the alveoli. alveolar ventilation prevents carbon dioxide buildup in the alveoli. there are two ways to keep the alveolar ventilation constant: increase the respiratory rate while decreasing the tidal volume of air per breath (shallow breathing), or decrease the respiratory rate while increasing the tidal volume per breath. in either case, the ventilation remains the same, but the work done and type of work needed are quite different. both tidal volume and respiratory rate are closely regulated when oxygen demand increases. there are two types of work conducted during respiration, flow-resistive and elastic work. flow-resistive refers to the work of the alveoli and tissues in the lung, whereas elastic work refers to the work of the intercostal muscles, chest wall, and diaphragm. increasing the respiration rate increases the flow-resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles. decreasing the respiratory rate reverses the type of work required. the air-tissue/water interface of the alveoli has a high surface tension. this surface tension is similar to the surface tension of water at the liquid-air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together. surfactant is a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the alveoli tissue and the air found within the alveoli. by lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid, it reduces the tendency of alveoli to collapse. surfactant works like a detergent to reduce the surface tension and allows for easier inflation of the airways. when a balloon is first inflated, it takes a large amount of effort to stretch the plastic and start to inflate the balloon. if a little bit of detergent was applied to the interior of the balloon, then the amount of effort or work needed to begin to inflate the balloon would decrease, and it would become much easier to start blowing up the balloon. this same principle applies to the airways. a small amount of surfactant to the airway tissues reduces the effort or work needed to inflate those airways. babies born prematurely sometimes do not produce enough surfactant. as a result, they suffer from respiratory distress syndrome, because it requires more effort to inflate their lungs. surfactant is also important for preventing collapse of small alveoli relative to large alveoli. pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs. two main causes of decreased gas exchange are compliance (how elastic the lung is) and resistance (how much obstruction exists in the airways). a change in either can dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. examples of restrictive diseases are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. in both diseases, the airways are less compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic. there is a decrease in compliance because the lung tissue cannot bend and move. in these types of restrictive diseases, the intrapleural pressure is more positive and the airways collapse upon exhalation, which traps air in the lungs. forced or functional vital capacity (fvc), which is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after taking the deepest breath possible, is much lower than in normal patients, and the time it takes to exhale most of the air is greatly prolonged ([link]). a patient suffering from these diseases cannot exhale the normal amount of air. obstructive diseases and conditions include emphysema, asthma, and pulmonary edema. in emphysema, which mostly arises from smoking tobacco, the walls of the alveoli are destroyed, decreasing the surface area for gas exchange. the overall compliance of the lungs is increased, because as the alveolar walls are damaged, lung elastic recoil decreases due to a loss of elastic fibers, and more air is trapped in the lungs at the end of exhalation. asthma is a disease in which inflammation is triggered by environmental factors. inflammation obstructs the airways. the obstruction may be due to edema (fluid accumulation), smooth muscle spasms in the walls of the bronchioles, increased mucus secretion, damage to the epithelia of the airways, or a combination of these events. those with asthma or edema experience increased occlusion from increased inflammation of the airways. this tends to block the airways, preventing the proper movement of gases ([link]). those with obstructive diseases have large volumes of air trapped after exhalation and breathe at a very high lung volume to compensate for the lack of airway recruitment. pulmonary circulation pressure is very low compared to that of the systemic circulation. it is also independent of cardiac output. this is because of a phenomenon called recruitment, which is the process of opening airways that normally remain closed when cardiac output increases. as cardiac output increases, the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused (filled with blood) increases. these capillaries and arteries are not always in use but are ready if needed. at times, however, there is a mismatch between the amount of air (ventilation, v) and the amount of blood (perfusion, q) in the lungs. this is referred to as ventilation/perfusion (v/q) mismatch. there are two types of v/q mismatch. both produce dead space, regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue. dead spaces can severely impact breathing, because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion. as a result, the amount of oxygen in the blood decreases, whereas the carbon dioxide level increases. dead space is created when no ventilation and/or perfusion takes place. anatomical dead space or anatomical shunt, arises from an anatomical failure, while physiological dead space or physiological shunt, arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries. an example of an anatomical shunt is the effect of gravity on the lungs. the lung is particularly susceptible to changes in the magnitude and direction of gravitational forces. when someone is standing or sitting upright, the pleural pressure gradient leads to increased ventilation further down in the lung. as a result, the intrapleural pressure is more negative at the base of the lung than at the top, and more air fills the bottom of the lung than the top. likewise, it takes less energy to pump blood to the bottom of the lung than to the top when in a prone position. perfusion of the lung is not uniform while standing or sitting. this is a result of hydrostatic forces combined with the effect of airway pressure. an anatomical shunt develops because the ventilation of the airways does not match the perfusion of the arteries surrounding those airways. as a result, the rate of gas exchange is reduced. note that this does not occur when lying down, because in this position, gravity does not preferentially pull the bottom of the lung down. a physiological shunt can develop if there is infection or edema in the lung that obstructs an area. this will decrease ventilation but not affect perfusion; therefore, the v/q ratio changes and gas exchange is affected. the lung can compensate for these mismatches in ventilation and perfusion. if ventilation is greater than perfusion, the arterioles dilate and the bronchioles constrict. this increases perfusion and reduces ventilation. likewise, if ventilation is less than perfusion, the arterioles constrict and the bronchioles dilate to correct the imbalance. view the mechanics of breathing.
 the structure of the lungs and thoracic cavity control the mechanics of breathing. upon inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and lowers. the intercostal muscles contract and expand the chest wall outward. the intrapleural pressure drops, the lungs expand, and air is drawn into the airways. when exhaling, the intercostal muscles and diaphragm relax, returning the intrapleural pressure back to the resting state. the lungs recoil and airways close. the air passively exits the lung. there is high surface tension at the air-airway interface in the lung. surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins, acts like a detergent in the airways to reduce surface tension and allow for opening of the alveoli. breathing and gas exchange are both altered by changes in the compliance and resistance of the lung. if the compliance of the lung decreases, as occurs in restrictive diseases like fibrosis, the airways stiffen and collapse upon exhalation. air becomes trapped in the lungs, making breathing more difficult. if resistance increases, as happens with asthma or emphysema, the airways become obstructed, trapping air in the lungs and causing breathing to become difficult. alterations in the ventilation of the airways or perfusion of the arteries can affect gas exchange. these changes in ventilation and perfusion, called v/q mismatch, can arise from anatomical or physiological changes.","[('visceral pleura', 'visceral pleuras'), ('resistance', 'resistances'), ('pleurisy', 'pleurisies'), ('dead space', 'dead spaces'), ('respiratory rate', 'respiratory rates'), ('ventilation/perfusion', 'ventilation/perfusions'), ('respiratory distres syndrome', 'respiratory distres syndromes', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'respiratory distress syndromes'), ('inhalation', 'inhalations'), ('obstructive disease', 'obstructive diseases'), ('functional vital capacity', 'functional vital capacities'), ('elastic work', 'elastic works'), ('asthma', 'asthmas'), ('pleura', 'pleuras'), ('anatomical shunt', 'anatomical shunts'), ('physiological dead space', 'physiological dead spaces'), ('surfactant', 'surfactants'), ('boyle law', 'boyle laws'), ('thoracic cavity', 'thoracic cavities'), ('robert boyle', 'robert boyles'), ('therapod', 'therapods'), ('intrapleural space', 'intrapleural spaces'), ('elastic recoil', 'elastic recoils'), ('intercostal muscle', 'intercostal muscles'), ('outward recoil', 'outward recoils'), ('recruitment', 'recruitments'), ('exhalation', 'exhalations'), ('physiological shunt', 'physiological shunts'), ('alveolar ventilation', 'alveolar ventilations'), ('diaphragm', 'diaphragms'), ('anatomical dead space', 'anatomical dead spaces'), ('restrictive disease', 'restrictive diseases'), ('flow-resistive', 'flow-resistives'), ('compliance', 'compliances')]"
205,stax-bio,39,The Respiratory System,4,m44799,Transport of Gases in Human Bodily Fluids,"once the oxygen diffuses across the alveoli, it enters the bloodstream and is transported to the tissues where it is unloaded, and carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli to be expelled from the body. although gas exchange is a continuous process, the oxygen and carbon dioxide are transported by different mechanisms. although oxygen dissolves in blood, only a small amount of oxygen is transported this way. only 1.5 percent of oxygen in the blood is dissolved directly into the blood itself. most oxygen98.5 percentis bound to a protein called hemoglobin and carried to the tissues. hemoglobin, or hb, is a protein molecule found in red blood cells (erythrocytes) made of four subunits: two alpha subunits and two beta subunits ([link]). each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule, allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules. molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red. as a result, oxygenated arterial blood where the hb is carrying four oxygen molecules is bright red, while venous blood that is deoxygenated is darker red. it is easier to bind a second and third oxygen molecule to hb than the first molecule. this is because the hemoglobin molecule changes its shape, or conformation, as oxygen binds. the fourth oxygen is then more difficult to bind. the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin can be plotted as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (x-axis) versus the relative hb-oxygen saturation (y-axis). the resulting graphan oxygen dissociation curveis sigmoidal, or s-shaped ([link]). as the partial pressure of oxygen increases, the hemoglobin becomes increasingly saturated with oxygen. the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin determines how much oxygen is carried in the blood. in addition to

, other environmental factors and diseases can affect oxygen carrying capacity and delivery. carbon dioxide levels, blood ph, and body temperature affect oxygen-carrying capacity ([link]). when carbon dioxide is in the blood, it reacts with water to form bicarbonate

 and hydrogen ions (h+). as the level of carbon dioxide in the blood increases, more h+ is produced and the ph decreases. this increase in carbon dioxide and subsequent decrease in ph reduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. the oxygen dissociates from the hb molecule, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. therefore, more oxygen is needed to reach the same hemoglobin saturation level as when the ph was higher. a similar shift in the curve also results from an increase in body temperature. increased temperature, such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle, causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced. diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the bloods ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen-carrying capacity. in sickle cell anemia, the shape of the red blood cell is crescent-shaped, elongated, and stiffened, reducing its ability to deliver oxygen ([link]). in this form, red blood cells cannot pass through the capillaries. this is painful when it occurs. thalassemia is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in either the alpha or the beta subunit of hb. patients with thalassemia produce a high number of red blood cells, but these cells have lower-than-normal levels of hemoglobin. therefore, the oxygen-carrying capacity is diminished. carbon dioxide molecules are transported in the blood from body tissues to the lungs by one of three methods: dissolution directly into the blood, binding to hemoglobin, or carried as a bicarbonate ion. several properties of carbon dioxide in the blood affect its transport. first, carbon dioxide is more soluble in blood than oxygen. about 5 to 7 percent of all carbon dioxide is dissolved in the plasma. second, carbon dioxide can bind to plasma proteins or can enter red blood cells and bind to hemoglobin. this form transports about 10 percent of the carbon dioxide. when carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin, a molecule called carbaminohemoglobin is formed. binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin is reversible. therefore, when it reaches the lungs, the carbon dioxide can freely dissociate from the hemoglobin and be expelled from the body. third, the majority of carbon dioxide molecules (85 percent) are carried as part of the bicarbonate buffer system. in this system, carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells. carbonic anhydrase (ca) within the red blood cells quickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic acid (h2co3). carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule that immediately dissociates into bicarbonate ions

 and hydrogen (h+) ions. since carbon dioxide is quickly converted into bicarbonate ions, this reaction allows for the continued uptake of carbon dioxide into the blood down its concentration gradient. it also results in the production of h+ ions. if too much h+ is produced, it can alter blood ph. however, hemoglobin binds to the free h+ ions and thus limits shifts in ph. the newly synthesized bicarbonate ion is transported out of the red blood cell into the liquid component of the blood in exchange for a chloride ion (cl-); this is called the chloride shift. when the blood reaches the lungs, the bicarbonate ion is transported back into the red blood cell in exchange for the chloride ion. the h+ ion dissociates from the hemoglobin and binds to the bicarbonate ion. this produces the carbonic acid intermediate, which is converted back into carbon dioxide through the enzymatic action of ca. the carbon dioxide produced is expelled through the lungs during exhalation. the benefit of the bicarbonate buffer system is that carbon dioxide is soaked up into the blood with little change to the ph of the system. this is important because it takes only a small change in the overall ph of the body for severe injury or death to result. the presence of this bicarbonate buffer system also allows for people to travel and live at high altitudes: when the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide change at high altitudes, the bicarbonate buffer system adjusts to regulate carbon dioxide while maintaining the correct ph in the body. while carbon dioxide can readily associate and dissociate from hemoglobin, other molecules such as carbon monoxide (co) cannot. carbon monoxide has a greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. therefore, when carbon monoxide is present, it binds to hemoglobin preferentially over oxygen. as a result, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin, so very little oxygen is transported through the body ([link]). carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas and is therefore difficult to detect. it is produced by gas-powered vehicles and tools. carbon monoxide can cause headaches, confusion, and nausea; long-term exposure can cause brain damage or death. administering 100 percent (pure) oxygen is the usual treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning. administration of pure oxygen speeds up the separation of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin. hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that is comprised of two alpha and two beta subunits that surround an iron-containing heme group. oxygen readily binds this heme group. the ability of oxygen to bind increases as more oxygen molecules are bound to heme. disease states and altered conditions in the body can affect the binding ability of oxygen, and increase or decrease its ability to dissociate from hemoglobin. carbon dioxide can be transported through the blood via three methods. it is dissolved directly in the blood, bound to plasma proteins or hemoglobin, or converted into bicarbonate. the majority of carbon dioxide is transported as part of the bicarbonate system. carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells. inside, carbonic anhydrase converts carbon dioxide into carbonic acid (h2co3), which is subsequently hydrolyzed into bicarbonate

 and h+. the h+ ion binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, and bicarbonate is transported out of the red blood cells in exchange for a chloride ion. this is called the chloride shift. bicarbonate leaves the red blood cells and enters the blood plasma. in the lungs, bicarbonate is transported back into the red blood cells in exchange for chloride. the h+ dissociates from hemoglobin and combines with bicarbonate to form carbonic acid with the help of carbonic anhydrase, which further catalyzes the reaction to convert carbonic acid back into carbon dioxide and water. the carbon dioxide is then expelled from the lungs.","[('thalassemium', 'thalassemias', 'thalassemia'), ('chloride shift', 'chloride shifts'), ('carbaminohemoglobin', 'carbaminohemoglobins'), ('sickle cell anemium', 'sickle cell anemias', 'sickle cell anemia', 'sickle cells anemium', 'sickle cells anemias', 'sickle cells anemia', 'sickles cell anemium', 'sickles cell anemias', 'sickles cell anemia', 'sickles cells anemium', 'sickles cells anemias', 'sickles cells anemia'), ('hemoglobin', 'hemoglobins'), ('bicarbonate', 'bicarbonates'), ('oxygen dissociation curve', 'oxygen dissociation curves', 'oxygen dissociations curve', 'oxygen dissociations curves', 'oxygens dissociation curve', 'oxygens dissociation curves', 'oxygens dissociations curve', 'oxygens dissociations curves'), ('carbonic acid intermediate', 'carbonic acid intermediates', 'carbonic acids intermediate', 'carbonic acids intermediates'), ('heme group', 'heme groups'), ('oxygen-carrying capacity', 'oxygen-carrying capacities'), ('carbon monoxide', 'carbon monoxides'), ('carbonic anhydrase', 'carbonic anhydrases'), ('bicarbonate buffer system', 'bicarbonate buffer systems', 'bicarbonate buffers system', 'bicarbonate buffers systems', 'bicarbonates buffer system', 'bicarbonates buffer systems', 'bicarbonates buffers system', 'bicarbonates buffers systems')]"
206,stax-bio,40,The Circulatory System,0,m44800,Introduction,"most animals are complex multicellular organisms that require a mechanism for transporting nutrients throughout their bodies and removing waste products. the circulatory system has evolved over time from simple diffusion through cells in the early evolution of animals to a complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of the human body. this extensive network supplies the cells, tissues, and organs with oxygen and nutrients, and removes carbon dioxide and waste, which are byproducts of respiration. at the core of the human circulatory system is the heart. the size of a clenched fist, the human heart is protected beneath the rib cage. made of specialized and unique cardiac muscle, it pumps blood throughout the body and to the heart itself. heart contractions are driven by intrinsic electrical impulses that the brain and endocrine hormones help to regulate. understanding the hearts basic anatomy and function is important to understanding the bodys circulatory and respiratory systems. gas exchange is one essential function of the circulatory system. a circulatory system is not needed in organisms with no specialized respiratory organs because oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse directly between their body tissues and the external environment. however, in organisms that possess lungs and gills, oxygen must be transported from these specialized respiratory organs to the body tissues via a circulatory system.  therefore, circulatory systems have had to evolve to accommodate the great diversity of body sizes and body types present among animals.","[('cardiomyocyte', 'cardiomyocytes'), ('red blood cell', 'red blood cells', 'red bloods cell', 'red bloods cells'), ('myocardial infarction', 'myocardial infarctions'), ('electrocardiogram', 'electrocardiograms'), ('coronary artery', 'coronary arteries'), ('endocardium', 'endocardiums'), ('lymph node', 'lymph nodes'), ('blood vessel', 'blood vessels'), ('platelet', 'platelets'), ('atrium', 'atriums'), ('semilunar valve', 'semilunar valves'), ('mitral valve', 'mitral valves'), ('bp', 'bps'), ('heart structure', 'heart structures'), ('ostium', 'ostiums'), ('aortum', 'aortas', 'aorta'), ('coronary vein', 'coronary veins'), ('pericardium', 'pericardiums'), ('closed circulatory system', 'closed circulatory systems'), ('capillary bed', 'capillary beds'), ('ventricle', 'ventricles'), ('atherosclerosi', 'atheroscleroses', 'atherosclerosis'), ('heart anatomy', 'heart anatomies'), ('vein', 'veins'), ('systemic circulation', 'systemic circulations'), ('myocardium', 'myocardiums'), ('open circulatory system', 'open circulatory systems'), ('pulmonary circulation', 'pulmonary circulations'), ('interstitial fluid', 'interstitial fluids'), ('white blood cell', 'white blood cells', 'white bloods cell', 'white bloods cells'), ('arteriole', 'arterioles'), ('coagulation', 'coagulations'), ('superior vena cava', 'superior vena cavas', 'superior venas cava', 'superior venas cavas'), ('blood flow', 'blood flows'), ('capillary', 'capillaries'), ('blood pressure regulation', 'blood pressure regulations', 'blood pressures regulation', 'blood pressures regulations', 'bloods pressure regulation', 'bloods pressure regulations', 'bloods pressures regulation', 'bloods pressures regulations'), ('cardiac output', 'cardiac outputs'), ('cardiac cycle', 'cardiac cycles'), ('double circulation', 'double circulations'), ('circulatory system', 'circulatory systems'), ('vena cava', 'vena cavas'), ('angina', 'anginas'), ('gill circulation', 'gill circulations'), ('vasoconstriction', 'vasoconstrictions'), ('unidirectional circulation', 'unidirectional circulations'), ('atrioventricular valve', 'atrioventricular valves'), ('heart', 'hearts'), ('vasodilation', 'vasodilations'), ('circulation', 'circulations'), ('serum', 'serums'), ('ecg', 'ecgs'), ('peripheral resistance', 'peripheral resistances'), ('cardiac arrest', 'cardiac arrests'), ('heart attack', 'heart attacks'), ('biscuspid valve', 'biscuspid valves'), ('sinoatrial (sa) node', 'sinoatrial (sa) nodes'), ('venule', 'venules'), ('inferior vena cava', 'inferior vena cavas', 'inferior venas cava', 'inferior venas cavas'), ('systole', 'systoles'), ('pulmocutaneous circulation', 'pulmocutaneous circulations'), ('blood type', 'blood types'), ('blood pressure', 'blood pressures'), ('diastole', 'diastoles'), ('cardiac muscle', 'cardiac muscles'), ('precapillary sphincter', 'precapillary sphincters'), ('blood', 'bloods'), ('tricuspid valve', 'tricuspid valves'), ('hemocoel', 'hemocoels'), ('plasma', 'plasmas'), ('artery', 'arteries'), ('hemolymph', 'hemolymphs'), ('epicardium', 'epicardiums')]"
207,stax-bio,40,The Circulatory System,1,m44801,Overview of the Circulatory System,"in all animals, except a few simple types, the circulatory system is used to transport nutrients and gases through the body. simple diffusion allows some water, nutrient, waste, and gas exchange into primitive animals that are only a few cell layers thick; however, bulk flow is the only method by which the entire body of larger more complex organisms is accessed. the circulatory system is effectively a network of cylindrical vessels: the arteries, veins, and capillaries that emanate from a pump, the heart. in all vertebrate organisms, as well as some invertebrates, this is a closed-loop system, in which the blood is not free in a cavity. in a closed circulatory system, blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around the systemic circulatory route, then returns to the heart again, as illustrated in [link]a. as opposed to a closed system, arthropodsincluding insects, crustaceans, and most molluskshave an open circulatory system, as illustrated in [link]b. in an open circulatory system, the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a hemocoel and is called hemolymph because the blood mixes with the interstitial fluid. as the heart beats and the animal moves, the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called ostia. this movement allows for gas and nutrient exchange. an open circulatory system does not use as much energy as a closed system to operate or to maintain; however, there is a trade-off with the amount of blood that can be moved to metabolically active organs and tissues that require high levels of oxygen. in fact, one reason that insects with wing spans of up to two feet wide (70 cm) are not around today is probably because they were outcompeted by the arrival of birds 150 million years ago. birds, having a closed circulatory system, are thought to have moved more agilely, allowing them to get food faster and possibly to prey on the insects. the circulatory system varies from simple systems in invertebrates to more complex systems in vertebrates. the simplest animals, such as the sponges (porifera) and rotifers (rotifera), do not need a circulatory system because diffusion allows adequate exchange of water, nutrients, and waste, as well as dissolved gases, as shown in [link]a. organisms that are more complex but still only have two layers of cells in their body plan, such as jellies (cnidaria) and comb jellies (ctenophora) also use diffusion through their epidermis and internally through the gastrovascular compartment. both their internal and external tissues are bathed in an aqueous environment and exchange fluids by diffusion on both sides, as illustrated in [link]b. exchange of fluids is assisted by the pulsing of the jellyfish body. for more complex organisms, diffusion is not efficient for cycling gases, nutrients, and waste effectively through the body; therefore, more complex circulatory systems evolved. most arthropods and many mollusks have open circulatory systems. in an open system, an elongated beating heart pushes the hemolymph through the body and muscle contractions help to move fluids. the larger more complex crustaceans, including lobsters, have developed arterial-like vessels to push blood through their bodies, and the most active mollusks, such as squids, have evolved a closed circulatory system and are able to move rapidly to catch prey. closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are significant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptation during evolution and associated differences in anatomy. [link] illustrates the basic circulatory systems of some vertebrates: fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. as illustrated in [link]a fish have a single circuit for blood flow and a two-chambered heart that has only a single atrium and a single ventricle. the atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re-oxygenated; this is called gill circulation. the blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium; this is called systemic circulation. this unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fishs systemic circuit. the result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body, reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish. in amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called pulmonary circulation, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). in amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. as shown in [link]b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. the two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the hearts ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. the advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. the mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. for this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in [link]c. the ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. one adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth. in mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in [link]d. the oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. the four-chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. the independent evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is referred to as convergent evolution. in most animals, the circulatory system is used to transport blood through the body. some primitive animals use diffusion for the exchange of water, nutrients, and gases. however, complex organisms use the circulatory system to carry gases, nutrients, and waste through the body. circulatory systems may be open (mixed with the interstitial fluid) or closed (separated from the interstitial fluid). closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are significant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptions during evolution and associated differences in anatomy. fish have a two-chambered heart with unidirectional circulation. amphibians have a three-chambered heart, which has some mixing of the blood, and they have double circulation. most non-avian reptiles have a three-chambered heart, but have little mixing of the blood; they have double circulation. mammals and birds have a four-chambered heart with no mixing of the blood and double circulation.","[('double circulation', 'double circulations'), ('ventricle', 'ventricles'), ('pulmocutaneous circulation', 'pulmocutaneous circulations'), ('closed circulatory system', 'closed circulatory systems'), ('circulatory system', 'circulatory systems'), ('gill circulation', 'gill circulations'), ('hemolymph', 'hemolymphs'), ('systemic circulation', 'systemic circulations'), ('atrium', 'atriums'), ('ostium', 'ostiums'), ('open circulatory system', 'open circulatory systems'), ('interstitial fluid', 'interstitial fluids'), ('pulmonary circulation', 'pulmonary circulations'), ('hemocoel', 'hemocoels'), ('unidirectional circulation', 'unidirectional circulations')]"
208,stax-bio,40,The Circulatory System,2,m44804,Components of the Blood,"hemoglobin is responsible for distributing oxygen, and to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide, throughout the circulatory systems of humans, vertebrates, and many invertebrates. the blood is more than the proteins, though. blood is actually a term used to describe the liquid that moves through the vessels and includes plasma (the liquid portion, which contains water, proteins, salts, lipids, and glucose) and the cells (red and white cells) and cell fragments called platelets. blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water, proteins, electrolytes, lipids, and glucose. the cells are responsible for carrying the gases (red cells) and immune the response (white). the platelets are responsible for blood clotting. interstitial fluid that surrounds cells is separate from the blood, but in hemolymph, they are combined. in humans, cellular components make up approximately 45 percent of the blood and the liquid plasma 55 percent. blood is 20 percent of a persons extracellular fluid and eight percent of weight. blood, like the human blood illustrated in [link] is important for regulation of the bodys systems and homeostasis. blood helps maintain homeostasis by stabilizing ph, temperature, osmotic pressure, and by eliminating excess heat. blood supports growth by distributing nutrients and hormones, and by removing waste. blood plays a protective role by transporting clotting factors and platelets to prevent blood loss and transporting the disease-fighting agents or white blood cells to sites of infection. red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythro- = red; -cyte = cell), are specialized cells that circulate through the body delivering oxygen to cells; they are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow. in mammals, red blood cells are small biconcave cells that at maturity do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria and are only 78 m in size. in birds and non-avian reptiles, a nucleus is still maintained in red blood cells. the red coloring of blood comes from the iron-containing protein hemoglobin, illustrated in [link]a. the principal job of this protein is to carry oxygen, but it also transports carbon dioxide as well. hemoglobin is packed into red blood cells at a rate of about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin per cell. each hemoglobin molecule binds four oxygen molecules so that each red blood cell carries one billion molecules of oxygen. there are approximately 25 trillion red blood cells in the five liters of blood in the human body, which could carry up to 25 sextillion (25  1021) molecules of oxygen in the body at any time. in mammals, the lack of organelles in erythrocytes leaves more room for the hemoglobin molecules, and the lack of mitochondria also prevents use of the oxygen for metabolic respiration. only mammals have anucleated red blood cells, and some mammals (camels, for instance) even have nucleated red blood cells. the advantage of nucleated red blood cells is that these cells can undergo mitosis. anucleated red blood cells metabolize anaerobically (without oxygen), making use of a primitive metabolic pathway to produce atp and increase the efficiency of oxygen transport. not all organisms use hemoglobin as the method of oxygen transport. invertebrates that utilize hemolymph rather than blood use different pigments to bind to the oxygen. these pigments use copper or iron to the oxygen. invertebrates have a variety of other respiratory pigments. hemocyanin, a blue-green, copper-containing protein, illustrated in [link]b is found in mollusks, crustaceans, and some of the arthropods. chlorocruorin, a green-colored, iron-containing pigment is found in four families of polychaete tubeworms. hemerythrin, a red, iron-containing protein is found in some polychaete worms and annelids and is illustrated in [link]c. despite the name, hemerythrin does not contain a heme group and its oxygen-carrying capacity is poor compared to hemoglobin. the small size and large surface area of red blood cells allows for rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the plasma membrane. in the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is taken in by the blood. in the tissues, oxygen is released from the blood and carbon dioxide is bound for transport back to the lungs. studies have found that hemoglobin also binds nitrous oxide (no). no is a vasodilator that relaxes the blood vessels and capillaries and may help with gas exchange and the passage of red blood cells through narrow vessels. nitroglycerin, a heart medication for angina and heart attacks, is converted to no to help relax the blood vessels and increase oxygen flow through the body. a characteristic of red blood cells is their glycolipid and glycoprotein coating; these are lipids and proteins that have carbohydrate molecules attached. in humans, the surface glycoproteins and glycolipids on red blood cells vary between individuals, producing the different blood types, such as a, b, and o. red blood cells have an average life span of 120 days, at which time they are broken down and recycled in the liver and spleen by phagocytic macrophages, a type of white blood cell. white blood cells, also called leukocytes (leuko = white), make up approximately one percent by volume of the cells in blood. the role of white blood cells is very different than that of red blood cells: they are primarily involved in the immune response to identify and target pathogens, such as invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms. white blood cells are formed continually; some only live for hours or days, but some live for years. the morphology of white blood cells differs significantly from red blood cells. they have nuclei and do not contain hemoglobin. the different types of white blood cells are identified by their microscopic appearance after histologic staining, and each has a different specialized function. the two main groups, both illustrated in [link] are the granulocytes, which include the neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, and the agranulocytes, which include the monocytes and lymphocytes. granulocytes contain granules in their cytoplasm; the agranulocytes are so named because of the lack of granules in their cytoplasm. some leukocytes become macrophages that either stay at the same site or move through the blood stream and gather at sites of infection or inflammation where they are attracted by chemical signals from foreign particles and damaged cells. lymphocytes are the primary cells of the immune system and include b cells, t cells, and natural killer cells. b cells destroy bacteria and inactivate their toxins. they also produce antibodies. t cells attack viruses, fungi, some bacteria, transplanted cells, and cancer cells. t cells attack viruses by releasing toxins that kill the viruses. natural killer cells attack a variety of infectious microbes and certain tumor cells. one reason that hiv poses significant management challenges is because the virus directly targets t cells by gaining entry through a receptor. once inside the cell, hiv then multiplies using the t cells own genetic machinery. after the hiv virus replicates, it is transmitted directly from the infected t cell to macrophages. the presence of hiv can remain unrecognized for an extensive period of time before full disease symptoms develop. blood must clot to heal wounds and prevent excess blood loss. small cell fragments called platelets (thrombocytes) are attracted to the wound site where they adhere by extending many projections and releasing their contents. these contents activate other platelets and also interact with other coagulation factors, which convert fibrinogen, a water-soluble protein present in blood serum into fibrin (a non-water soluble protein), causing the blood to clot. many of the clotting factors require vitamin k to work, and vitamin k deficiency can lead to problems with blood clotting. many platelets converge and stick together at the wound site forming a platelet plug (also called a fibrin clot), as illustrated in [link]b. the plug or clot lasts for a number of days and stops the loss of blood. platelets are formed from the disintegration of larger cells called megakaryocytes, like that shown in [link]a. for each megakaryocyte, 20003000 platelets are formed with 150,000 to 400,000 platelets present in each cubic millimeter of blood. each platelet is disc shaped and 24 m in diameter. they contain many small vesicles but do not contain a nucleus. the liquid component of blood is called plasma, and it is separated by spinning or centrifuging the blood at high rotations (3000 rpm or higher). the blood cells and platelets are separated by centrifugal forces to the bottom of a specimen tube. the upper liquid layer, the plasma, consists of 90 percent water along with various substances required for maintaining the bodys ph, osmotic load, and for protecting the body. the plasma also contains the coagulation factors and antibodies. the plasma component of blood without the coagulation factors is called the serum. serum is similar to interstitial fluid in which the correct composition of key ions acting as electrolytes is essential for normal functioning of muscles and nerves. other components in the serum include proteins that assist with maintaining ph and osmotic balance while giving viscosity to the blood. the serum also contains antibodies, specialized proteins that are important for defense against viruses and bacteria. lipids, including cholesterol, are also transported in the serum, along with various other substances including nutrients, hormones, metabolic waste, plus external substances, such as, drugs, viruses, and bacteria. human serum albumin is the most abundant protein in human blood plasma and is synthesized in the liver. albumin, which constitutes about half of the blood serum protein, transports hormones and fatty acids, buffers ph, and maintains osmotic pressures. immunoglobin is a protein antibody produced in the mucosal lining and plays an important role in antibody mediated immunity. blood types related to proteins on the surface of the red blood cells
red blood cells are coated in antigens made of glycolipids and glycoproteins. the composition of these molecules is determined by genetics, which have evolved over time. in humans, the different surface antigens are grouped into 24 different blood groups with more than 100 different antigens on each red blood cell. the two most well known blood groups are the abo, shown in [link], and rh systems. the surface antigens in the abo blood group are glycolipids, called antigen a and antigen b. people with blood type a have antigen a, those with blood type b have antigen b, those with blood type ab have both antigens, and people with blood type o have neither antigen. antibodies called agglutinougens are found in the blood plasma and react with the a or b antigens, if the two are mixed. when type a and type b blood are combined, agglutination (clumping) of the blood occurs because of antibodies in the plasma that bind with the opposing antigen; this causes clots that coagulate in the kidney causing kidney failure. type o blood has neither a or b antigens, and therefore, type o blood can be given to all blood types. type o negative blood is the universal donor. type ab positive blood is the universal acceptor because it has both a and b antigen. the abo blood groups were discovered in 1900 and 1901 by karl landsteiner at the university of vienna. the rh blood group was first discovered in rhesus monkeys. most people have the rh antigen (rh+) and do not have anti-rh antibodies in their blood. the few people who do not have the rh antigen and are rh can develop anti-rh antibodies if exposed to rh+ blood. this can happen after a blood transfusion or after an rh woman has an rh+ baby. the first exposure does not usually cause a reaction; however, at the second exposure, enough antibodies have built up in the blood to produce a reaction that causes agglutination and breakdown of red blood cells. an injection can prevent this reaction. specific components of the blood include red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and the plasma, which contains coagulation factors and serum. blood is important for regulation of the bodys ph, temperature, osmotic pressure, the circulation of nutrients and removal of waste, the distribution of hormones from endocrine glands, and the elimination of excess heat; it also contains components for blood clotting. red blood cells are specialized cells that contain hemoglobin and circulate through the body delivering oxygen to cells. white blood cells are involved in the immune response to identify and target invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms; they also recycle waste components, such as old red blood cells. platelets and blood clotting factors cause the change of the soluble protein fibrinogen to the insoluble protein fibrin at a wound site forming a plug. plasma consists of 90 percent water along with various substances, such as coagulation factors and antibodies. the serum is the plasma component of the blood without the coagulation factors.","[('white blood cell', 'white blood cells', 'white bloods cell', 'white bloods cells'), ('serum', 'serums'), ('circulatory system', 'circulatory systems'), ('red blood cell', 'red blood cells', 'red bloods cell', 'red bloods cells'), ('blood type', 'blood types'), ('blood', 'bloods'), ('plasma', 'plasmas'), ('coagulation', 'coagulations'), ('platelet', 'platelets')]"
209,stax-bio,40,The Circulatory System,3,m44805,Mammalian Heart and Blood Vessels,"the heart is a complex muscle that pumps blood through the three divisions of the circulatory system: the coronary (vessels that serve the heart), pulmonary (heart and lungs), and systemic (systems of the body), as shown in [link]. coronary circulation intrinsic to the heart takes blood directly from the main artery (aorta) coming from the heart. for pulmonary and systemic circulation, the heart has to pump blood to the lungs or the rest of the body, respectively. in vertebrates, the lungs are relatively close to the heart in the thoracic cavity. the shorter distance to pump means that the muscle wall on the right side of the heart is not as thick as the left side which must have enough pressure to pump blood all the way to your big toe. the heart muscle is asymmetrical as a result of the distance blood must travel in the pulmonary and systemic circuits. since the right side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to the whole body in the systemic circuit, as shown in [link]. in humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. there is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. the atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood. the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from the inferior vena cava which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. in addition, the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself. this deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the atrioventricular valve or the tricuspid valve, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the backflow of blood. the valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve. after it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, by-passing the semilunar valve (or pulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation. after blood passes through the pulmonary arteries, the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle. the left atrium then receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. this blood passes through the bicuspid valve or mitral valve (the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through aorta, the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta, the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle. this pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals. the heart is composed of three layers; the epicardium, the myocardium, and the endocardium, illustrated in [link]. the inner wall of the heart has a lining called the endocardium. the myocardium consists of the heart muscle cells that make up the middle layer and the bulk of the heart wall. the outer layer of cells is called the epicardium, of which the second layer is a membranous layered structure called the pericardium that surrounds and protects the heart; it allows enough room for vigorous pumping but also keeps the heart in place to reduce friction between the heart and other structures. the heart has its own blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood. the coronary arteries branch from the aorta and surround the outer surface of the heart like a crown. they diverge into capillaries where the heart muscle is supplied with oxygen before converging again into the coronary veins to take the deoxygenated blood back to the right atrium where the blood will be re-oxygenated through the pulmonary circuit. the heart muscle will die without a steady supply of blood. atherosclerosis is the blockage of an artery by the buildup of fatty plaques. because of the size (narrow) of the coronary arteries and their function in serving the heart itself, atherosclerosis can be deadly in these arteries. the slowdown of blood flow and subsequent oxygen deprivation that results from atherosclerosis causes severe pain, known as angina, and complete blockage of the arteries will cause myocardial infarction: the death of cardiac muscle tissue, commonly known as a heart attack. the main purpose of the heart is to pump blood through the body; it does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle. the cardiac cycle is the coordination of the filling and emptying of the heart of blood by electrical signals that cause the heart muscles to contract and relax. the human heart beats over 100,000 times per day. in each cardiac cycle, the heart contracts (systole), pushing out the blood and pumping it through the body; this is followed by a relaxation phase (diastole), where the heart fills with blood, as illustrated in [link]. the atria contract at the same time, forcing blood through the atrioventricular valves into the ventricles. closing of the atrioventricular valves produces a monosyllabic lup sound. following a brief delay, the ventricles contract at the same time forcing blood through the semilunar valves into the aorta and the artery transporting blood to the lungs (via the pulmonary artery). closing of the semilunar valves produces a monosyllabic dup sound. the pumping of the heart is a function of the cardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, that make up the heart muscle. cardiomyocytes, shown in [link], are distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle; they are connected by intercalated disks exclusive to cardiac muscle. they are self-stimulated for a period of time and isolated cardiomyocytes will beat if given the correct balance of nutrients and electrolytes. the autonomous beating of cardiac muscle cells is regulated by the hearts internal pacemaker that uses electrical signals to time the beating of the heart. the electrical signals and mechanical actions, illustrated in [link], are intimately intertwined. the internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial (sa) node, which is located near the wall of the right atrium. electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the sa node causing the two atria to contract in unison. the pulse reaches a second node, called the atrioventricular (av) node, between the right atrium and right ventricle where it pauses for approximately 0.1 second before spreading to the walls of the ventricles. from the av node, the electrical impulse enters the bundle of his, then to the left and right bundle branches extending through the interventricular septum. finally, the purkinje fibers conduct the impulse from the apex of the heart up the ventricular myocardium, and then the ventricles contract. this pause allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood. the electrical impulses in the heart produce electrical currents that flow through the body and can be measured on the skin using electrodes. this information can be observed as an electrocardiogram (ecg)a recording of the electrical impulses of the cardiac muscle. the blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels ([link]). arteries take blood away from the heart. the main artery is the aorta that branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs. these major arteries include the carotid artery that takes blood to the brain, the brachial arteries that take blood to the arms, and the thoracic artery that takes blood to the thorax and then into the hepatic, renal, and gastric arteries for the liver, kidney, and stomach, respectively. the iliac artery takes blood to the lower limbs. the major arteries diverge into minor arteries, and then smaller vessels called arterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body. arterioles diverge into capillary beds. capillary beds contain a large number (10 to 100) of capillaries that branch among the cells and tissues of the body. capillaries are narrow-diameter tubes that can fit red blood cells through in single file and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level. fluid also crosses into the interstitial space from the capillaries. the capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins that take blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart. veins are blood vessels that bring blood back to the heart. the major veins drain blood from the same organs and limbs that the major arteries supply. fluid is also brought back to the heart via the lymphatic system. the structure of the different types of blood vessels reflects their function or layers. there are three distinct layers, or tunics, that form the walls of blood vessels ([link]). the first tunic is a smooth, inner lining of endothelial cells that are in contact with the red blood cells. the endothelial tunic is continuous with the endocardium of the heart. in capillaries, this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells, as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis. the movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by vasoconstriction, narrowing of the blood vessels, and vasodilation, widening of the blood vessels; this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure. veins and arteries both have two further tunics that surround the endothelium: the middle tunic is composed of smooth muscle and the outermost layer is connective tissue (collagen and elastic fibers). the elastic connective tissue stretches and supports the blood vessels, and the smooth muscle layer helps regulate blood flow by altering vascular resistance through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. the arteries have thicker smooth muscle and connective tissue than the veins to accommodate the higher pressure and speed of freshly pumped blood. the veins are thinner walled as the pressure and rate of flow are much lower. in addition, veins are structurally different than arteries in that veins have valves to prevent the backflow of blood. because veins have to work against gravity to get blood back to the heart, contraction of skeletal muscle assists with the flow of blood back to the heart. the heart muscle pumps blood through three divisions of the circulatory system: coronary, pulmonary, and systemic. there is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. the pumping of the heart is a function of cardiomyocytes, distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle. the internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial node, which is located near the wall of the right atrium. electrical charges pulse from the sa node causing the two atria to contract in unison; then the pulse reaches the atrioventricular node between the right atrium and right ventricle. a pause in the electric signal allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood. the blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels; arteries take blood away from the heart, and veins bring blood back to the heart.","[('cardiomyocyte', 'cardiomyocytes'), ('myocardial infarction', 'myocardial infarctions'), ('electrocardiogram', 'electrocardiograms'), ('endocardium', 'endocardiums'), ('blood vessel', 'blood vessels'), ('angina', 'anginas'), ('semilunar valve', 'semilunar valves'), ('mitral valve', 'mitral valves'), ('cardiac arrest', 'cardiac arrests'), ('heart structure', 'heart structures'), ('vein', 'veins'), ('aortum', 'aortas', 'aorta'), ('coronary vein', 'coronary veins'), ('capillary bed', 'capillary beds'), ('atherosclerosi', 'atheroscleroses', 'atherosclerosis'), ('heart anatomy', 'heart anatomies'), ('venule', 'venules'), ('myocardium', 'myocardiums'), ('ecg', 'ecgs'), ('superior vena cava', 'superior vena cavas', 'superior venas cava', 'superior venas cavas'), ('diastole', 'diastoles'), ('coronary artery', 'coronary arteries'), ('pericardium', 'pericardiums'), ('cardiac cycle', 'cardiac cycles'), ('circulatory system', 'circulatory systems'), ('vena cava', 'vena cavas'), ('vasoconstriction', 'vasoconstrictions'), ('atrioventricular valve', 'atrioventricular valves'), ('heart', 'hearts'), ('epicardium', 'epicardiums'), ('arteriole', 'arterioles'), ('cardiac muscle', 'cardiac muscles'), ('biscuspid valve', 'biscuspid valves'), ('sinoatrial (sa) node', 'sinoatrial (sa) nodes'), ('inferior vena cava', 'inferior vena cavas', 'inferior venas cava', 'inferior venas cavas'), ('vasodilation', 'vasodilations'), ('blood flow', 'blood flows'), ('capillary', 'capillaries'), ('systole', 'systoles'), ('tricuspid valve', 'tricuspid valves'), ('artery', 'arteries'), ('heart attack', 'heart attacks')]"
210,stax-bio,40,The Circulatory System,4,m44806,Blood Flow and Blood Pressure Regulation,"blood pressure (bp) is the pressure exerted by blood on the walls of a blood vessel that helps to push blood through the body. systolic blood pressure measures the amount of pressure that blood exerts on vessels while the heart is beating. the optimal systolic blood pressure is 120 mmhg. diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the vessels between heartbeats. the optimal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmhg. many factors can affect blood pressure, such as hormones, stress, exercise, eating, sitting, and standing. blood flow through the body is regulated by the size of blood vessels, by the action of smooth muscle, by one-way valves, and by the fluid pressure of the blood itself. blood is pushed through the body by the action of the pumping heart. with each rhythmic pump, blood is pushed under high pressure and velocity away from the heart, initially along the main artery, the aorta. in the aorta, the blood travels at 30 cm/sec. as blood moves into the arteries, arterioles, and ultimately to the capillary beds, the rate of movement slows dramatically to about 0.026 cm/sec, one-thousand times slower than the rate of movement in the aorta. while the diameter of each individual arteriole and capillary is far narrower than the diameter of the aorta, and according to the law of continuity, fluid should travel faster through a narrower diameter tube, the rate is actually slower due to the overall diameter of all the combined capillaries being far greater than the diameter of the individual aorta. the slow rate of travel through the capillary beds, which reach almost every cell in the body, assists with gas and nutrient exchange and also promotes the diffusion of fluid into the interstitial space. after the blood has passed through the capillary beds to the venules, veins, and finally to the main venae cavae, the rate of flow increases again but is still much slower than the initial rate in the aorta. blood primarily moves in the veins by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and by the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves. because most veins must move blood against the pull of gravity, blood is prevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way valves. because skeletal muscle contraction aids in venous blood flow, it is important to get up and move frequently after long periods of sitting so that blood will not pool in the extremities. blood flow through the capillary beds is regulated depending on the bodys needs and is directed by nerve and hormone signals. for example, after a large meal, most of the blood is diverted to the stomach by vasodilation of vessels of the digestive system and vasoconstriction of other vessels. during exercise, blood is diverted to the skeletal muscles through vasodilation while blood to the digestive system would be lessened through vasoconstriction. the blood entering some capillary beds is controlled by small muscles, called precapillary sphincters, illustrated in [link]. if the sphincters are open, the blood will flow into the associated branches of the capillary blood. if all of the sphincters are closed, then the blood will flow directly from the arteriole to the venule through the thoroughfare channel (see [link]). these muscles allow the body to precisely control when capillary beds receive blood flow. at any given moment only about 5-10% of our capillary beds actually have blood flowing through them. see the circulatory systems blood flow.

 proteins and other large solutes cannot leave the capillaries. the loss of the watery plasma creates a hyperosmotic solution within the capillaries, especially near the venules. this causes about 85% of the plasma that leaves the capillaries to eventually diffuses back into the capillaries near the venules. the remaining 15% of blood plasma drains out from the interstitial fluid into nearby lymphatic vessels ([link]). the fluid in the lymph is similar in composition to the interstitial fluid. the lymph fluid passes through lymph nodes before it returns to the heart via the vena cava. lymph nodes are specialized organs that filter the lymph by percolation through a maze of connective tissue filled with white blood cells. the white blood cells remove infectious agents, such as bacteria and viruses, to clean the lymph before it returns to the bloodstream. after it is cleaned, the lymph returns to the heart by the action of smooth muscle pumping, skeletal muscle action, and one-way valves joining the returning blood near the junction of the venae cavae entering the right atrium of the heart. vertebrate diversity in blood circulation
blood circulation has evolved differently in vertebrates and may show variation in different animals for the required amount of pressure, organ and vessel location, and organ size. animals with longs necks and those that live in cold environments have distinct blood pressure adaptations. long necked animals, such as giraffes, need to pump blood upward from the heart against gravity. the blood pressure required from the pumping of the left ventricle would be equivalent to 250 mm hg (mm hg = millimeters of mercury, a unit of pressure) to reach the height of a giraffes head, which is 2.5 meters higher than the heart. however, if checks and balances were not in place, this blood pressure would damage the giraffes brain, particularly if it was bending down to drink. these checks and balances include valves and feedback mechanisms that reduce the rate of cardiac output. long-necked dinosaurs such as the sauropods had to pump blood even higher, up to ten meters above the heart. this would have required a blood pressure of more than 600 mm hg, which could only have been achieved by an enormous heart. evidence for such an enormous heart does not exist and mechanisms to reduce the blood pressure required include the slowing of metabolism as these animals grew larger. it is likely that they did not routinely feed on tree tops but grazed on the ground. living in cold water, whales need to maintain the temperature in their blood. this is achieved by the veins and arteries being close together so that heat exchange can occur. this mechanism is called a countercurrent heat exchanger. the blood vessels and the whole body are also protected by thick layers of blubber to prevent heat loss. in land animals that live in cold environments, thick fur and hibernation are used to retain heat and slow metabolism. the pressure of the blood flow in the body is produced by the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid (blood) against the walls of the blood vessels. fluid will move from areas of high to low hydrostatic pressures. in the arteries, the hydrostatic pressure near the heart is very high and blood flows to the arterioles where the rate of flow is slowed by the narrow openings of the arterioles. during systole, when new blood is entering the arteries, the artery walls stretch to accommodate the increase of pressure of the extra blood; during diastole, the walls return to normal because of their elastic properties. the blood pressure of the systole phase and the diastole phase, graphed in [link], gives the two pressure readings for blood pressure. for example, 120/80 indicates a reading of 120 mm hg during the systole and 80 mm hg during diastole. throughout the cardiac cycle, the blood continues to empty into the arterioles at a relatively even rate. this resistance to blood flow is called peripheral resistance. cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart in one minute. it is calculated by multiplying the number of heart contractions that occur per minute (heart rate) times the stroke volume (the volume of blood pumped into the aorta per contraction of the left ventricle). therefore, cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate, as when exercising. however, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater strength. stroke volume can also be increased by speeding blood circulation through the body so that more blood enters the heart between contractions.  during heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased heart rate and ensuring adequate oxygenated blood gets to the muscles. stress triggers a decrease in the diameter of the blood vessels, consequently increasing blood pressure. these changes can also be caused by nerve signals or hormones, and even standing up or lying down can have a great effect on blood pressure. blood primarily moves through the body by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and by the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves. blood is prevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way valves. blood flow through the capillary beds is controlled by precapillary sphincters to increase and decrease flow depending on the bodys needs and is directed by nerve and hormone signals. lymph vessels take fluid that has leaked out of the blood to the lymph nodes where it is cleaned before returning to the heart. during systole, blood enters the arteries, and the artery walls stretch to accommodate the extra blood. during diastole, the artery walls return to normal. the blood pressure of the systole phase and the diastole phase gives the two pressure readings for blood pressure.","[('cardiac output', 'cardiac outputs'), ('lymph node', 'lymph nodes'), ('circulatory system', 'circulatory systems'), ('blood pressure', 'blood pressures'), ('blood flow', 'blood flows'), ('circulation', 'circulations'), ('precapillary sphincter', 'precapillary sphincters'), ('peripheral resistance', 'peripheral resistances'), ('bp', 'bps'), ('blood pressure regulation', 'blood pressure regulations', 'blood pressures regulation', 'blood pressures regulations', 'bloods pressure regulation', 'bloods pressure regulations', 'bloods pressures regulation', 'bloods pressures regulations')]"

212,stax-bio,41,Osmotic Regulation and Excretion,1,m44808,Osmoregulation and Osmotic Balance,"osmosis is the diffusion of water across a membrane in response to osmotic pressure caused by an imbalance of molecules on either side of the membrane. osmoregulation is the process of maintenance of salt and water balance (osmotic balance) across membranes within the bodys fluids, which are composed of water, plus electrolytes and non-electrolytes. an electrolyte is a solute that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water. a non-electrolyte, in contrast, doesnt dissociate into ions during water dissolution. both electrolytes and non-electrolytes contribute to the osmotic balance. the bodys fluids include blood plasma, the cytosol within cells, and interstitial fluid, the fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body. the membranes of the body (such as the pleural, serous, and cell membranes) are semi-permeable membranes. semi-permeable membranes are permeable (or permissive) to certain types of solutes and water. solutions on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane tend to equalize in solute concentration by movement of solutes and/or water across the membrane. as seen in [link], a cell placed in water tends to swell due to gain of water from the hypotonic or low salt environment. a cell placed in a solution with higher salt concentration, on the other hand, tends to make the membrane shrivel up due to loss of water into the hypertonic or high salt environment. isotonic cells have an equal concentration of solutes inside and outside the cell; this equalizes the osmotic pressure on either side of the cell membrane which is a semi-permeable membrane. the body does not exist in isolation. there is a constant input of water and electrolytes into the system. while osmoregulation is achieved across membranes within the body, excess electrolytes and wastes are transported to the kidneys and excreted, helping to maintain osmotic balance. biological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of consumption of food and water and through excretion in the form of sweat, urine, and feces. without a mechanism to regulate osmotic pressure, or when a disease damages this mechanism, there is a tendency to accumulate toxic waste and water, which can have dire consequences. mammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes, but also specific concentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments: blood plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular fluid. since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across membranes, the volume of the fluid compartments can also change temporarily. because blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a direct bearing on blood pressure. electrolytes, such as sodium chloride, ionize in water, meaning that they dissociate into their component ions. in water, sodium chloride (nacl), dissociates into the sodium ion (na+) and the chloride ion (cl). the most important ions, whose concentrations are
very closely regulated in body fluids, are the cations sodium (na+), potassium (k+), calcium (ca+2),
magnesium (mg+2), and the anions chloride (cl-), carbonate (co3-2), bicarbonate (hco3-), and phosphate(po3-).  electrolytes are lost from the body during urination and perspiration. for this
reason, athletes are encouraged to replace electrolytes and fluids during periods of increased activity and perspiration. 

 osmotic pressure is influenced by the concentration of solutes in a solution. it is directly proportional to
the number of solute atoms or molecules and not dependent on the size of the solute molecules. because  electrolytes dissociate into their component ions, they, in essence, add more solute particles into the solution and have a greater effect on osmotic pressure, per mass than compounds that do not dissociate in water, such as glucose.
 water can pass through membranes by passive diffusion. if electrolyte ions could passively diffuse across membranes, it would be impossible to maintain specific concentrations of ions in each fluid compartment therefore they require special mechanisms to cross the semi-permeable membranes in the body. this movement can be accomplished by facilitated diffusion and active transport. facilitated diffusion requires protein-based channels for moving the solute. active transport requires energy in the form of atp conversion, carrier proteins, or pumps in order to move ions against the concentration gradient. in order to calculate osmotic pressure, it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured. the unit for measuring solutes is the mole. one mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute. for example, the molecular weight of sodium chloride is 58.44. thus, one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams. the molarity of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. the molality of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. if the solvent is water, one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water. while molarity and molality are used to express the concentration of solutions, electrolyte concentrations are usually expressed in terms of milliequivalents per liter (meq/l): the meq/l is equal to the ion concentration (in millimoles) multiplied by the number of electrical charges on the ion. the unit of milliequivalent takes into consideration the ions present in the solution (since electrolytes form ions in aqueous solutions) and the charge on the ions. thus, for ions that have a charge of one, one milliequivalent is equal to one millimole. for ions that have a charge of two (like calcium), one milliequivalent is equal to 0.5 millimoles. another unit for the expression of electrolyte concentration is the milliosmole (mosm), which is the number of milliequivalents of solute per kilogram of solvent. body fluids are usually maintained within the range of 280 to 300 mosm. persons lost at sea without any fresh water to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human body cannot adapt to drinking seawater, which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids. organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only a relatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline. about 90 percent of all bony fish are restricted to either freshwater or seawater. they are incapable of osmotic regulation in the opposite environment. it is possible, however, for a few fishes like salmon to spend part of their life in fresh water and part in sea water. organisms like the salmon and molly that can tolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms. this is possible because some fish have evolved osmoregulatory mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments. when they live in fresh water, their bodies tend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic, as illustrated in [link]a. in such hypotonic environments, these fish do not drink much water. instead, they pass a lot of very dilute urine, and they achieve electrolyte balance by active transport of salts through the gills. when they move to a hypertonic marine environment, these fish start drinking sea water; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine, as illustrated in [link]b. most marine invertebrates, on the other hand, may be isotonic with sea water (osmoconformers). their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration. cartilaginous fishes salt composition of the blood is similar to bony fishes; however, the blood of sharks contains the organic compounds urea and trimethylamine oxide (tmao). this does not mean that their electrolyte composition is similar to that of sea water. they achieve isotonicity with the sea by storing large concentrations of urea. these animals that secrete urea are called ureotelic animals. tmao stabilizes proteins in the presence of high urea levels, preventing the disruption of peptide bonds that would occur in other animals exposed to similar levels of urea. sharks are cartilaginous fish with a rectal gland to secrete salt and assist in osmoregulation. dialysis techniciandialysis is a medical process of removing wastes and excess water from the blood by diffusion and ultrafiltration. when kidney function fails, dialysis must be done to artificially rid the body of wastes. this is a vital process to keep patients alive. in some cases, the patients undergo artificial dialysis until they are eligible for a kidney transplant. in others who are not candidates for kidney transplants, dialysis is a life-long necessity. dialysis technicians typically work in hospitals and clinics. while some roles in this field include equipment development and maintenance, most dialysis technicians work in direct patient care. their on-the-job duties, which typically occur under the direct supervision of a registered nurse, focus on providing dialysis treatments. this can include reviewing patient history and current condition, assessing and responding to patient needs before and during treatment, and monitoring the dialysis process. treatment may include taking and reporting a patients vital signs and preparing solutions and equipment to ensure accurate and sterile procedures. solute concentrations across a semi-permeable membranes influence the movement of water and solutes across the membrane. it is the number of solute molecules and not the molecular size that is important in osmosis. osmoregulation and osmotic balance are important bodily functions, resulting in water and salt balance. not all solutes can pass through a semi-permeable membrane. osmosis is the movement of water across the membrane. osmosis occurs to equalize the number of solute molecules across a semi-permeable membrane by the movement of water to the side of higher solute concentration. facilitated diffusion utilizes protein channels to move solute molecules from areas of higher to lower concentration while active transport mechanisms are required to move solutes against concentration gradients. osmolarity is measured in units of milliequivalents or milliosmoles, both of which take into consideration the number of solute particles and the charge on them. fish that live in fresh water or saltwater adapt by being osmoregulators or osmoconformers.","[('mole', 'moles'), ('milliosmole', 'milliosmoles'), ('semi-permeable membrane', 'semi-permeable membranes'), ('electrolyte transport', 'electrolyte transports'), ('tonicity', 'tonicities'), ('milliequivalent', 'milliequivalents'), ('osmolality', 'osmolalities'), ('osmoregulator', 'osmoregulators'), ('milliequivalent per liter', 'milliequivalent per liters', 'milliequivalents per liter', 'milliequivalents per liters'), ('molality', 'molalities'), ('molarity', 'molarities'), ('osmoregulatory', 'osmoregulatories'), ('electrolyte', 'electrolytes'), ('active transport', 'active transports'), ('osmoconformer', 'osmoconformers'), ('osmoregulation', 'osmoregulations'), ('gram molecular weight', 'gram molecular weights', 'grams molecular weight', 'grams molecular weights'), ('osmotic excretion', 'osmotic excretions'), ('osmolarity', 'osmolarities'), ('osmotic regulation', 'osmotic regulations'), ('dialysi', 'dialyses', 'dialysis'), ('non-electrolyte', 'non-electrolytes'), ('osmotic system', 'osmotic systems'), ('osmosi', 'osmoses', 'osmosis'), ('osmotic pressure', 'osmotic pressures'), ('osmotic balance', 'osmotic balances')]"
213,stax-bio,41,Osmotic Regulation and Excretion,2,m44809,The Kidneys and Osmoregulatory Organs,"although the kidneys are the major osmoregulatory organ, the skin and lungs also play a role in the process. water and electrolytes are lost through sweat glands in the skin, which helps moisturize and cool the skin surface, while the lungs expel a small amount of water in the form of mucous secretions and via evaporation of water vapor. the kidneys, illustrated in [link], are a pair of bean-shaped structures that are located just below and posterior to the liver in the peritoneal cavity. the adrenal glands sit on top of each kidney and are also called the suprarenal glands. kidneys filter blood and purify it. all the blood in the human body is filtered many times a day by the kidneys; these organs use up almost 25 percent of the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to perform this function. oxygen allows the kidney cells to efficiently manufacture chemical energy in the form of atp through aerobic respiration. the filtrate coming out of the kidneys is called urine. externally, the kidneys  are surrounded by three layers, illustrated in [link]. the outermost layer is a tough connective tissue layer called the renal fascia. the second layer is called the perirenal fat capsule, which helps anchor the kidneys in place. the third and innermost layer is the renal capsule. internally, the kidney has three regionsan outer cortex, a medulla in the middle, and the renal pelvis in the region called the hilum of the kidney. the hilum is the concave part of the bean-shape where blood vessels and nerves enter and exit the kidney; it is also the point of exit for the ureters. the renal cortex is granular due to the presence of nephronsthe functional unit of the kidney. the medulla consists of multiple pyramidal tissue masses, called the renal pyramids. in between the pyramids are spaces called renal columns through which the blood vessels pass. the tips of the pyramids, called renal papillae, point toward the renal pelvis. there are, on average, eight renal pyramids in each kidney. the renal pyramids along with the adjoining cortical region are called the lobes of the kidney. the renal pelvis leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney. on the inside of the kidney, the renal pelvis branches out into two or three extensions called the major calyces, which further branch into the minor calyces. the ureters are urine-bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder. because the kidney filters blood, its network of blood vessels is an important component of its structure and function. the arteries, veins, and nerves that supply the kidney enter and exit at the renal hilum. renal blood supply starts with the branching of the aorta into the renal arteries (which are each named based on the region of the kidney they pass through) and ends with the exiting of the renal veins to join the inferior vena cava. the renal arteries split into several segmental arteries upon entering the kidneys. each segmental artery splits further into several interlobar arteries and enters the renal columns, which supply the renal lobes. the interlobar arteries split at the junction of the renal cortex and medulla to form the arcuate arteries. the arcuate bow shaped arteries form arcs along the base of the medullary pyramids. cortical radiate arteries, as the name suggests, radiate out from the arcuate arteries. the cortical radiate arteries branch into numerous afferent arterioles, and then enter the capillaries supplying the nephrons. veins trace the path of the arteries and have similar names, except there are no segmental veins. as mentioned previously, the functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, illustrated in [link]. each kidney is made up of over one million nephrons that dot the renal cortex, giving it a granular appearance when sectioned sagittally. there are two types of nephronscortical nephrons (85 percent), which are deep in the renal cortex, and juxtamedullary nephrons (15 percent), which lie in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. a nephron consists of three partsa renal corpuscle, a renal tubule, and the associated capillary network, which originates from the cortical radiate arteries. the renal corpuscle, located in the renal cortex, is made up of a network of capillaries known as the glomerulus and the capsule, a cup-shaped chamber that surrounds it, called the glomerular or bowman's capsule. the renal tubule is a long and convoluted structure that emerges from the glomerulus and can be divided into three parts based on function. the first part is called the proximal convoluted tubule (pct) due to its proximity to the glomerulus; it stays in the renal cortex. the second part is called the loop of henle, or nephritic loop, because it forms a loop (with descending and ascending limbs) that goes through the renal medulla. the third part of the renal tubule is called the distal convoluted tubule (dct) and this part is also restricted to the renal cortex. the dct, which is the last part of the nephron, connects and empties its contents into collecting ducts that line the medullary pyramids. the collecting ducts amass contents from multiple nephrons and fuse together as they enter the papillae of the renal medulla. the capillary network that originates from the renal arteries supplies the nephron with blood that needs to be filtered. the branch that enters the glomerulus is called the afferent arteriole. the branch that exits the glomerulus is called the efferent arteriole. within the glomerulus, the network of capillaries is called the glomerular capillary bed. once the efferent arteriole exits the glomerulus, it forms the peritubular capillary network, which surrounds and interacts with parts of the renal tubule. in cortical nephrons, the peritubular capillary network surrounds the pct and dct. in juxtamedullary nephrons, the peritubular capillary network forms a network around the loop of henle and is called the vasa recta. kidneys filter blood in a three-step process. first, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus. almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called glomerular filtration. second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the pct by a process called tubular reabsorption. in the loop of henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network. water is also reabsorbed during this step.  then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during tubular secretion, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption. the collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. from here, the papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis. this entire process is illustrated in [link]. glomerular filtration filters out most of the solutes due to high blood pressure and specialized membranes in the afferent arteriole. the blood pressure in the glomerulus is maintained independent of factors that affect systemic blood pressure. the leaky connections between the endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary network allow solutes to pass through easily. all solutes in the glomerular capillaries, except for macromolecules like proteins, pass through by passive diffusion. there is no energy requirement at this stage of the filtration process. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) is the volume of glomerular filtrate formed per minute by the kidneys. gfr is regulated by multiple mechanisms and is an important indicator of kidney function. tubular reabsorption occurs in the pct part of the renal tubule. almost all nutrients are reabsorbed, and this occurs either by passive or active transport. reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated and can be influenced by hormones. sodium (na+) is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to the peritubular capillaries. because na+ is actively transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic pressure. water is also independently reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins, or water channels, in the pct. this occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries. however, every solute has a transport maximum and the excess is not reabsorbed. in the loop of henle, the permeability of the membrane changes. the descending limb is permeable to water, not solutes; the opposite is true for the ascending limb. additionally, the loop of henle invades the renal medulla, which is naturally high in salt concentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and concentrate the filtrate. the osmotic gradient increases as it moves deeper into the medulla. because two sides of the loop of henle perform opposing functions, as illustrated in [link], it acts as a countercurrent multiplier. the vasa recta around it acts as the countercurrent exchanger. by the time the filtrate reaches the dct, most of the urine and solutes have been reabsorbed. if the body requires additional water, all of it can be reabsorbed at this point. further reabsorption is controlled by hormones, which will be discussed in a later section. excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with tubular secretion. undesirable products like metabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion. most of the tubular secretion happens in the dct, but some occurs in the early part of the collecting duct. kidneys also maintain an acid-base balance by secreting excess h+ ions. although parts of the renal tubules are named proximal and distal, in a cross-section of the kidney, the tubules are placed close together and in contact with each other and the glomerulus. this allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the different cell types. for example, the dct ascending limb of the loop of henle has masses of cells called macula densa, which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called juxtaglomerular cells. together, the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex (jgc). the jgc is an endocrine structure that secretes the enzyme renin and the hormone erythropoietin. when hormones trigger the macula densa cells in the dct due to variations in blood volume, blood pressure, or electrolyte balance, these cells can immediately communicate the problem to the capillaries in the afferent and efferent arterioles, which can constrict or relax to change the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys. nephrologista nephrologist studies and deals with diseases of the kidneysboth those that cause kidney failure (such as diabetes) and the conditions that are produced by kidney disease (such as hypertension). blood pressure, blood volume, and changes in electrolyte balance come under the purview of a nephrologist. nephrologists usually work with other physicians who refer patients to them or consult with them about specific diagnoses and treatment plans. patients are usually referred to a nephrologist for symptoms such as blood or protein in the urine, very high blood pressure, kidney stones, or renal failure. nephrology is a subspecialty of internal medicine. to become a nephrologist, medical school is followed by additional training to become certified in internal medicine. an additional two or more years is spent specifically studying kidney disorders and their accompanying effects on the body. the kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems; they function to filter blood and maintain the osmolarity of body fluids at 300 mosm. they are surrounded by three layers and are made up internally of three distinct regionsthe cortex, medulla, and pelvis. the blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with the aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. the renal arteries branch out from the aorta and enter the kidney where they further divide into segmental, interlobar, arcuate, and cortical radiate arteries. the nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which actively filters blood and generates urine. the nephron is made up of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule. cortical nephrons are found in the renal cortex, while juxtamedullary nephrons are found in the renal cortex close to the renal medulla. the nephron filters and exchanges water and solutes with two sets of blood vessels and the tissue fluid in the kidneys. there are three steps in the formation of urine: glomerular filtration, which occurs in the glomerulus; tubular reabsorption, which occurs in the renal tubules; and tubular secretion, which also occurs in the renal tubules.","[('afferent arteriole', 'afferent arterioles'), ('renal', 'renals'), ('lobe of the kidney', 'lobe of the kidney', 'lobes of the kidney', 'lobes of the kidney'), ('kidney physiology', 'kidney physiologies'), ('dct', 'dcts'), ('ureter', 'ureters'), ('kidney', 'kidneys'), ('cortex', 'cortices'), ('urinary bladder', 'urinary bladders'), ('renal corpuscle', 'renal corpuscles'), ('urine formation', 'urine formations'), ('renal capsule', 'renal capsules'), ('distal convoluted tubule', 'distal convoluted tubules'), ('juxtaglomerular complex', 'juxtaglomerular complexes'), ('osmotic regulation', 'osmotic regulations'), ('glomerular filtration', 'glomerular filtrations'), ('pct', 'pcts'), ('arcuate artery', 'arcuate arteries'), ('renal column', 'renal columns'), ('cortical nephron', 'cortical nephrons'), ('renal pelvi', 'renal pelvis'), ('countercurrent multiplier', 'countercurrent multipliers'), ('kidney function', 'kidney functions'), ('cortical radiate artery', 'cortical radiate arteries', 'cortical radiates artery', 'cortical radiates arteries'), ('renal fascium', 'renal fascias', 'renal fascia'), ('nephrology', 'nephrologies'), ('vasa rectum', 'vasa rectas', 'vasa recta'), ('granular cell', 'granular cells'), ('efferent arteriole', 'efferent arterioles'), ('glomerular filtration rate', 'glomerular filtration rates', 'glomerular filtrations rate', 'glomerular filtrations rates'), ('segmental artery', 'segmental arteries'), ('descending limb', 'descending limbs'), ('keratinocyte', 'keratinocytes'), ('interlobar artery', 'interlobar arteries'), ('nephrologist', 'nephrologists'), ('proximal convoluted tubule', 'proximal convoluted tubules'), ('osmoregulation', 'osmoregulations'), ('renal artery', 'renal arteries'), ('peritubular capillary network', 'peritubular capillary networks'), ('countercurrent exchanger', 'countercurrent exchangers'), ('hilum', 'hilums'), ('urine', 'urines'), ('inferior vena cava', 'inferior vena cavas', 'inferior venas cava', 'inferior venas cavas'), ('transport maximum', 'transport maxima'), ('renal tubule', 'renal tubules'), ('perirenal fat capsule', 'perirenal fat capsules'), ('gfr', 'gfrs'), ('tubular secretion', 'tubular secretions'), ('macula densa', 'macula densas'), ('glomerulu', 'glomeruluss', 'glomerulus'), ('juxtamedullary nephron', 'juxtamedullary nephrons'), ('tubular reabsorption', 'tubular reabsorptions'), ('nephron', 'nephrons'), ('osmotic excretion', 'osmotic excretions'), ('renal vein', 'renal veins'), ('medulla', 'medullas'), ('renal pyramid', 'renal pyramids'), ('ascending limb', 'ascending limbs'), ('osmotic system', 'osmotic systems'), ('loop of henle', 'loop of henle', 'loops of henle', 'loops of henle'), ('calyx', 'calyxes'), (""bowman' capsule"", ""bowman' capsules"")]"
214,stax-bio,41,Osmotic Regulation and Excretion,3,m44810,Excretion Systems,"microorganisms and invertebrate animals use more primitive and simple mechanisms to get rid of their metabolic wastes than the mammalian system of kidney and urinary function. three excretory systems evolved in organisms before complex kidneys: vacuoles, flame cells, and malpighian tubules. the most fundamental feature of life is the presence of a cell. in other words, a cell is the simplest functional unit of a life. bacteria are unicellular, prokaryotic organisms that have some of the least complex life processes in place; however, prokaryotes such as bacteria do not contain membrane-bound vacuoles. the cells of microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, and fungi are bound by cell membranes and use them to interact with the environment. some cells, including some leucocytes in humans, are able to engulf food by endocytosisthe formation of vesicles by involution of the cell membrane within the cells. the same vesicles are able to interact and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment. in some unicellular eukaryotic organisms such as the amoeba, shown in [link], cellular wastes and excess water are excreted by exocytosis, when the contractile vacuoles merge with the cell membrane and expel wastes into the environment. contractile vacuoles (cv) should not be confused with vacuoles, which store food or water. as multi-cellular systems evolved to have organ systems that divided the metabolic needs of the body, individual organs evolved to perform the excretory function. planaria are flatworms that live in fresh water. their excretory system consists of two tubules connected to a highly branched duct system. the cells in the tubules are called flame cells (or protonephridia) because they have a cluster of cilia that looks like a flickering flame when viewed under the microscope, as illustrated in [link]a. the cilia propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body through excretory pores that open on the body surface; cilia also draw water from the interstitial fluid, allowing for filtration. any valuable metabolites are recovered by reabsorption. flame cells are found in flatworms, including parasitic tapeworms and free-living planaria. they also maintain the organisms osmotic balance. earthworms (annelids) have slightly more evolved excretory structures called nephridia, illustrated in [link]b. a pair of nephridia is present on each segment of the earthworm. they are similar to flame cells in that they have a tubule with cilia. excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore. they are more evolved than the flame cells in that they have a system for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion. malpighian tubules are found lining the gut of some species of arthropods, such as the bee illustrated in [link]. they are usually found in pairs and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect. malpighian tubules are convoluted, which increases their surface area, and they are lined with microvilli for reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance. malpighian tubules work cooperatively with specialized glands in the wall of the rectum. body fluids are not filtered as in the case of nephridia; urine is produced by tubular secretion mechanisms by the cells lining the malpighian tubules that are bathed in hemolymph (a mixture of blood and interstitial fluid that is found in insects and other arthropods as well as most mollusks). metabolic wastes like uric acid freely diffuse into the tubules. there are exchange pumps lining the tubules, which actively transport h+ ions into the cell and k+ or na+ ions out; water passively follows to form urine. the secretion of ions alters the osmotic pressure which draws water, electrolytes, and nitrogenous waste (uric acid) into the tubules. water and electrolytes are reabsorbed when these organisms are faced with low-water environments, and uric acid is excreted as a thick paste or powder. not dissolving wastes in water helps these organisms to conserve water; this is especially important for life in dry environments. see a dissected cockroach, including a close-up look at its malpighian tubules.

 many systems have evolved for excreting wastes that are simpler than the kidney and urinary systems of vertebrate animals. the simplest system is that of contractile vacuoles present in microorganisms. flame cells and nephridia in worms perform excretory functions and maintain osmotic balance. some insects have evolved malpighian tubules to excrete wastes and maintain osmotic balance.","[('osmotic regulation', 'osmotic regulations'), ('flame cell', 'flame cells'), ('nephridium', 'nephridias', 'nephridia'), ('microvilli', 'microvillis'), ('vacuole', 'vacuoles'), ('annelid', 'annelids'), ('osmotic excretion', 'osmotic excretions'), ('nephridiopore', 'nephridiopores'), ('planarium', 'planarias', 'planaria'), ('waste excretion', 'waste excretions'), ('malpighian tubule', 'malpighian tubules'), ('osmotic system', 'osmotic systems')]"
215,stax-bio,41,Osmotic Regulation and Excretion,4,m44811,Nitrogenous Wastes,"of the four major macromolecules in biological systems, both proteins and nucleic acids contain nitrogen. during the catabolism, or breakdown, of nitrogen-containing macromolecules, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are extracted and stored in the form of carbohydrates and fats. excess nitrogen is excreted from the body. nitrogenous wastes tend to form toxic ammonia, which raises the ph of body fluids. the formation of ammonia itself requires energy in the form of atp and large quantities of water to dilute it out of a biological system. animals that live in aquatic environments tend to release ammonia into the water. animals that excrete ammonia are said to be ammonotelic. terrestrial organisms have evolved other mechanisms to excrete nitrogenous wastes. the animals must detoxify ammonia by converting it into a relatively nontoxic form such as urea or uric acid. mammals, including humans, produce urea, whereas reptiles and many terrestrial invertebrates produce uric acid. animals that secrete urea as the primary nitrogenous waste material are called ureotelic animals. the urea cycle is the primary mechanism by which mammals convert ammonia to urea. urea is made in the liver and excreted in urine. the overall chemical reaction by which ammonia is converted to urea is 2 nh3 (ammonia) + co2 + 3 atp + h2o  h2n-co-nh2 (urea) + 2 adp + 4 pi + amp.
 the urea cycle utilizes five intermediate steps, catalyzed by five different enzymes, to convert ammonia to urea, as shown in [link]. the amino acid l-ornithine gets converted into different intermediates before being regenerated at the end of the urea cycle. hence, the urea cycle is also referred to as the ornithine cycle. the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes a key step in the urea cycle and its deficiency can lead to accumulation of toxic levels of ammonia in the body. the first two reactions occur in the mitochondria and the last three reactions occur in the cytosol. urea concentration in the blood, called blood urea nitrogen or bun, is used as an indicator of kidney function. the theory of evolution proposes that life started in an aquatic environment. it is not surprising to see that biochemical pathways like the urea cycle evolved to adapt to a changing environment when terrestrial life forms evolved. arid conditions probably led to the evolution of the uric acid pathway as a means of conserving water. birds, reptiles, and most terrestrial arthropods convert toxic ammonia to uric acid or the closely related compound guanine (guano) instead of urea. mammals also form some uric acid during breakdown of nucleic acids. uric acid is a compound similar to purines found in nucleic acids. it is water insoluble and tends to form a white paste or powder; it is excreted by birds, insects, and reptiles. conversion of ammonia to uric acid requires more energy and is much more complex than conversion of ammonia to urea [link]. mammals use uric acid crystals as an antioxidant in their cells. however, too much uric acid tends to form kidney stones and may also cause a painful condition called gout, where uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints, as illustrated in [link]. food choices that reduce the amount of nitrogenous bases in the diet help reduce the risk of gout. for example, tea, coffee, and chocolate have purine-like compounds, called xanthines, and should be avoided by people with gout and kidney stones. ammonia is the waste produced by metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds like proteins and nucleic acids. while aquatic animals can easily excrete ammonia into their watery surroundings, terrestrial animals have evolved special mechanisms to eliminate the toxic ammonia from their systems. urea is the major byproduct of ammonia metabolism in vertebrate animals. uric acid is the major byproduct of ammonia metabolism in birds, terrestrial arthropods, and reptiles.","[('ammonium', 'ammonias', 'ammonia'), ('nitrogenous waste', 'nitrogenous wastes'), ('uric acid', 'uric acids'), ('gout', 'gouts'), ('osmotic regulation', 'osmotic regulations'), ('osmotic excretion', 'osmotic excretions'), ('antioxidant', 'antioxidants'), ('ureotelic', 'ureotelics'), ('bun', 'buns'), ('osmotic system', 'osmotic systems'), ('urea cycle', 'urea cycles'), ('ammonotelic', 'ammonotelics'), ('blood urea nitrogen', 'blood urea nitrogens', 'blood ureas nitrogen', 'blood ureas nitrogens', 'bloods urea nitrogen', 'bloods urea nitrogens', 'bloods ureas nitrogen', 'bloods ureas nitrogens')]"
216,stax-bio,41,Osmotic Regulation and Excretion,5,m44828,Hormonal Control of Osmoregulatory Functions,"while the kidneys operate to maintain osmotic balance and blood pressure in the body, they also act in concert with hormones. hormones are small molecules that act as messengers within the body. hormones are typically secreted from one cell and travel in the bloodstream to affect a target cell in another portion of the body. different regions of the nephron bear specialized cells that have receptors to respond to chemical messengers and hormones. [link] summarizes the hormones that control the osmoregulatory functions. epinephrine and norepinephrine are released by the adrenal medulla and nervous system respectively. they are the flight/fight hormones that are released when the body is under extreme stress. during stress, much of the bodys energy is used to combat imminent danger. kidney function is halted temporarily by epinephrine and norepinephrine. these hormones function by acting directly on the smooth muscles of blood vessels to constrict them. once the afferent arterioles are constricted, blood flow into the nephrons stops. these hormones go one step further and trigger the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, illustrated in [link] proceeds through several steps to produce angiotensin ii, which acts to stabilize blood pressure and volume. renin (secreted by a part of the juxtaglomerular complex) is produced by the granular cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles. thus, the kidneys control blood pressure and volume directly. renin acts on angiotensinogen, which is made in the liver and converts it to angiotensin i. angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) converts angiotensin i to angiotensin ii. angiotensin ii raises blood pressure by constricting blood vessels. it also triggers the release of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which in turn stimulates the renal tubules to reabsorb more sodium. angiotensin ii also triggers the release of anti-diuretic hormone (adh) from the hypothalamus, leading to water retention in the kidneys. it acts directly on the nephrons and decreases glomerular filtration rate. medically, blood pressure can be controlled by drugs that inhibit ace (called ace inhibitors). mineralocorticoids are hormones synthesized by the adrenal cortex that affect osmotic balance. aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid that regulates sodium levels in the blood. almost all of the sodium in the blood is reclaimed by the renal tubules under the influence of aldosterone. because sodium is always reabsorbed by active transport and water follows sodium to maintain osmotic balance, aldosterone manages not only sodium levels but also the water levels in body fluids. in contrast, the aldosterone also stimulates potassium secretion concurrently with sodium reabsorption. in contrast, absence of aldosterone means that no sodium gets reabsorbed in the renal tubules and all of it gets excreted in the urine. in addition, the daily dietary potassium load is not secreted and the retention of k+ can cause a dangerous increase in plasma k+ concentration. patients who have addison's disease have a failing adrenal cortex and cannot produce aldosterone. they lose sodium in their urine constantly, and if the supply is not replenished, the consequences can be fatal. as previously discussed, antidiuretic hormone or adh (also called vasopressin), as the name suggests, helps the body conserve water when body fluid volume, especially that of blood, is low. it is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored and released from the posterior pituitary. it acts by inserting aquaporins in the collecting ducts and promotes reabsorption of water. adh also acts as a vasoconstrictor and increases blood pressure during hemorrhaging. the atrial natriuretic peptide (anp) lowers blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator. it is released by cells in the atrium of the heart in response to high blood pressure and in patients with sleep apnea. anp affects salt release, and because water passively follows salt to maintain osmotic balance, it also has a diuretic effect. anp also prevents sodium reabsorption by the renal tubules, decreasing water reabsorption (thus acting as a diuretic) and lowering blood pressure. its actions suppress the actions of aldosterone, adh, and renin. hormonal cues help the kidneys synchronize the osmotic needs of the body. hormones like epinephrine, norepinephrine, renin-angiotensin, aldosterone, anti-diuretic hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide help regulate the needs of the body as well as the communication between the different organ systems.","[('mineralocorticoid', 'mineralocorticoids'), ('angiotensin ius', 'angiotensin iis', 'angiotensin ii'), ('angiotensin converting enzyme', 'angiotensin converting enzymes', 'angiotensins converting enzyme', 'angiotensins converting enzymes'), ('osmotic regulation', 'osmotic regulations'), ('hormone', 'hormones'), ('osmotic excretion', 'osmotic excretions'), ('renin-angiotensin', 'renin-angiotensins'), ('anti-diuretic hormone', 'anti-diuretic hormones'), ('adh', 'adhs'), ('ace', 'aces'), ('vasopressin', 'vasopressins'), ('vasodilator', 'vasodilators'), ('osmotic system', 'osmotic systems'), ('angiotensin i', 'angiotensin is')]"
217,stax-bio,42,The Immune System,0,m44817,Introduction,"the environment consists of numerous pathogens, which are agents, usually microorganisms, that cause diseases in their hosts. a host is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen. pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi and other infectious organisms. we are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water, on surfaces, and in the air. mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing protection from a majority of these disease agents. components of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens. when pathogens are found, immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection. the immune factors identify the nature of the pathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it efficiently, and then halt the immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage. the immune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient response upon re-exposure. this memory can last several decades. features of the immune system, such as pathogen identification, specific response, amplification, retreat, and remembrance are essential for survival against pathogens. the immune response can be classified as either innate or active. the innate immune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing on specific ones. conversely, the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific defenses.

218,stax-bio,42,The Immune System,1,m44820,Innate Immune Response,"the immune system comprises both innate and adaptive immune responses. innate immunity occurs naturally because of genetic factors or physiology; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the workload for the adaptive immune response. both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins, receptor-mediated signaling, and intricate cell-to-cell communication. the innate immune system developed early in animal evolution, roughly a billion years ago, as an essential response to infection. innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets: any pathogenic threat triggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection independently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response. for example, tears and mucus secretions contain microbicidal factors. before any immune factors are triggered, the skin functions as a continuous, impassable barrier to potentially infectious pathogens. pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation (drying out) and by the skins acidity. in addition, beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with invading pathogens, preventing infection. regions of the body that are not protected by skin (such as the eyes and mucus membranes) have alternative methods of defense, such as tears and mucus secretions that trap and rinse away pathogens, and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push the mucus with the pathogens out of the body. throughout the body are other defenses, such as the low ph of the stomach (which inhibits the growth of pathogens), blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell membranes, and the process of urination (which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract). despite these barriers, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia. some pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms that allow them to overcome physical and chemical barriers. when pathogens do enter the body, the innate immune system responds with inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of immune factors and proteins. an infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen. all viruses infect cells and replicate within those cells (intracellularly), whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or extracellularly, depending on the species. the innate immune system must respond accordingly: by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells that have already been infected. when a pathogen enters the body, cells in the blood and lymph detect the specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) on the pathogens surface. pamps are carbohydrate, polypeptide, and nucleic acid signatures that are expressed by viruses, bacteria, and parasites but which differ from molecules on host cells. the immune system has specific cells, described in [link] and shown in [link], with receptors that recognize these pamps. a macrophage is a large phagocytic cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens. macrophages recognize pamps via complementary pattern recognition receptors (prrs). prrs are molecules on macrophages and dendritic cells which are in contact with the external environment. a monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and differentiates into macrophages after it moves into infected tissue. dendritic cells bind molecular signatures of pathogens and promote pathogen engulfment and destruction. toll-like receptors (tlrs) are a type of prr that recognizes molecules that are shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules). tlrs are present in invertebrates as well as vertebrates, and appear to be one of the most ancient components of the immune system. tlrs have also been identified in the mammalian nervous system. the binding of prrs with pamps triggers the release of cytokines, which signal that a pathogen is present and needs to be destroyed along with any infected cells. a cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation (form and function), proliferation (production), and gene expression to affect immune responses. at least 40 types of cytokines exist in humans that differ in terms of the cell type that produces them, the cell type that responds to them, and the changes they produce. one type cytokine, interferon, is illustrated in [link]. one subclass of cytokines is the interleukin (il), so named because they mediate interactions between leukocytes (white blood cells). interleukins are involved in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses. in addition to being released from cells after pamp recognition, cytokines are released by the infected cells which bind to nearby uninfected cells and induce those cells to release cytokines, which results in a cytokine burst. a second class of early-acting cytokines is interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells. one of the functions of an interferon is to inhibit viral replication. they also have other important functions, such as tumor surveillance. interferons work by signaling neighboring uninfected cells to destroy rna and reduce protein synthesis, signaling neighboring infected cells to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), and activating immune cells. in response to interferons, uninfected cells alter their gene expression, which increases the cells resistance to infection. one effect of interferon-induced gene expression is a sharply reduced cellular protein synthesis. virally infected cells produce more viruses by synthesizing large quantities of viral proteins. thus, by reducing protein synthesis, a cell becomes resistant to viral infection. the first cytokines to be produced are pro-inflammatory; that is, they encourage inflammation, the localized redness, swelling, heat, and pain that result from the movement of leukocytes and fluid through increasingly permeable capillaries to a site of infection. the population of leukocytes that arrives at an infection site depends on the nature of the infecting pathogen. both macrophages and dendritic cells engulf pathogens and cellular debris through phagocytosis. a neutrophil is also a phagocytic leukocyte that engulfs and digests pathogens. neutrophils, shown in [link], are the most abundant leukocytes of the immune system. neutrophils have a nucleus with two to five lobes, and they contain organelles, called lysosomes, that digest engulfed pathogens. an eosinophil is a leukocyte that works with other eosinophils to surround a parasite; it is involved in the allergic response and in protection against helminthes (parasitic worms). neutrophils and eosinophils are particularly important leukocytes that engulf large pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi. a mast cell is a leukocyte that produces inflammatory molecules, such as histamine, in response to large pathogens. a basophil is a leukocyte that, like a neutrophil, releases chemicals to stimulate the inflammatory response as illustrated in [link]. basophils are also involved in allergy and hypersensitivity responses and induce specific types of inflammatory responses. eosinophils and basophils produce additional inflammatory mediators to recruit more leukocytes. a hypersensitive immune response to harmless antigens, such as in pollen, often involves the release of histamine by basophils and mast cells. cytokines also send feedback to cells of the nervous system to bring about the overall symptoms of feeling sick, which include lethargy, muscle pain, and nausea. these effects may have evolved because the symptoms encourage the individual to rest and prevent them from spreading the infection to others. cytokines also increase the core body temperature, causing a fever, which causes the liver to withhold iron from the blood. without iron, certain pathogens, such as some bacteria, are unable to replicate; this is called nutritional immunity. lymphocytes are leukocytes that are histologically identifiable by their large, darkly staining nuclei; they are small cells with very little cytoplasm, as shown in [link]. infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer (nk) cells, lymphocytes that can kill cells infected with viruses or tumor cells (abnormal cells that uncontrollably divide and invade other tissue). t cells and b cells of the adaptive immune system also are classified as lymphocytes. t cells are lymphocytes that mature in the thymus gland, and b cells are lymphocytes that mature in the bone marrow. nk cells identify intracellular infections, especially from viruses, by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class (mhc) i molecules on the surface of infected cells. mhc i molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells, thus they are scarce on red blood cells and platelets which are non-nucleated. the function of mhc i molecules is to display fragments of proteins from the infectious agents within the cell to t-cells; healthy cells will be ignored, while non-self or foreign proteins will be attacked by the immune system. mhc ii molecules are found mainly on cells containing antigens (non-self proteins) and on lymphocytes. mhc ii molecules interact with helper t-cells to trigger the appropriate immune response, which may include the inflammatory response. an infected cell (or a tumor cell) is usually incapable of synthesizing and displaying mhc i molecules appropriately. the metabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with mhc i processing and/or trafficking to the cell surface. the reduced mhc i on host cells varies from virus to virus and results from active inhibitors being produced by the viruses. this process can deplete host mhc i molecules on the cell surface, which nk cells detect as unhealthy or abnormal while searching for cellular mhc i molecules. similarly, the dramatically altered gene expression of tumor cells leads to expression of extremely deformed or absent mhc i molecules that also signal unhealthy or abnormal. nk cells are always active; an interaction with normal, intact mhc i molecules on a healthy cell disables the killing sequence, and the nk cell moves on. after the nk cell detects an infected or tumor cell, its cytoplasm secretes granules comprised of perforin, a destructive protein that creates a pore in the target cell. granzymes are released along with the perforin in the immunological synapse. a granzyme is a protease that digests cellular proteins and induces the target cell to undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis. phagocytic cells then digest the cell debris left behind. nk cells are constantly patrolling the body and are an effective mechanism for controlling potential infections and preventing cancer progression. an array of approximately 20 types of soluble proteins, called a complement system, functions to destroy extracellular pathogens. cells of the liver and macrophages synthesize complement proteins continuously; these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms. the complement system is so named because it is complementary to the antibody response of the adaptive immune system. complement proteins bind to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already bound by antibodies. binding of complement proteins occurs in a specific and highly regulated sequence, with each successive protein being activated by cleavage and/or structural changes induced upon binding of the preceding protein(s). after the first few complement proteins bind, a cascade of sequential binding events follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement proteins. complement proteins perform several functions. the proteins serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and b cells, and enhance engulfment; this process is called opsonization. certain complement proteins can combine to form attack complexes that open pores in microbial cell membranes. these structures destroy pathogens by causing their contents to leak, as illustrated in [link]. the innate immune system serves as a first responder to pathogenic threats that bypass natural physical and chemical barriers of the body. using a combination of cellular and molecular attacks, the innate immune system identifies the nature of a pathogen and responds with inflammation, phagocytosis, cytokine release, destruction by nk cells, and/or a complement system. when innate mechanisms are insufficient to clear an infection, the adaptive immune response is informed and mobilized.","[('immune system', 'immune systems'), ('opsonization', 'opsonizations'),

219,stax-bio,42,The Immune System,2,m44821,Adaptive Immune Response,"the adaptive, or acquired, immune response takes days or even weeks to become establishedmuch longer than the innate response; however, adaptive immunity is more specific to pathogens and has memory. adaptive immunity is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination. this part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection. in fact, without information from the innate immune system, the adaptive response could not be mobilized. there are two types of adaptive responses: the cell-mediated immune response, which is carried out by t cells, and the humoral immune response, which is controlled by activated b cells and antibodies. activated t cells and b cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen. their attack can kill pathogens directly or secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens and disrupt the infection. adaptive immunity also involves a memory to provide the host with long-term protection from reinfection with the same type of pathogen; on re-exposure, this memory will facilitate an efficient and quick response. unlike nk cells of the innate immune system, b cells (b lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that gives rise to antibodies, whereas t cells (t lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the immune response. t cells are a key component in the cell-mediated responsethe specific immune response that utilizes t cells to neutralize cells that have been infected with viruses and certain bacteria. there are three types of t cells: cytotoxic, helper, and suppressor t cells. cytotoxic t cells destroy virus-infected cells in the cell-mediated immune response, and helper t cells play a part in activating both the antibody and the cell-mediated immune responses. suppressor t cells deactivate t cells and b cells when needed, and thus prevent the immune response from becoming too intense. an antigen is a foreign or non-self macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system. not all antigens will provoke a response. for instance, individuals produce innumerable self antigens and are constantly exposed to harmless foreign antigens, such as food proteins, pollen, or dust components. the suppression of immune responses to harmless macromolecules is highly regulated and typically prevents processes that could be damaging to the host, known as tolerance. the innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens, and then inform the adaptive immune response about the presence of these antigens. an antigen-presenting cell (apc) is an immune cell that detects, engulfs, and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection. when a pathogen is detected, these apcs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen. antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the apc, where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells. dendritic cells are immune cells that process antigen material; they are present in the skin (langerhans cells) and the lining of the nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response, thus functioning as an antigen-presenting cell. macrophages also function as apcs. before activation and differentiation, b cells can also function as apcs. after phagocytosis by apcs, the phagocytic vesicle fuses with an intracellular lysosome forming phagolysosome. within the phagolysosome, the components are broken down into fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto mhc class i or mhc class ii molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation, as illustrated in [link]. note that t lymphocytes cannot properly respond to the antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an mhc ii molecule. apcs express mhc on their surfaces, and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal a non-self invader. once the fragment of antigen is embedded in the mhc ii molecule, the immune cell can respond. helper t- cells are one of the main lymphocytes that respond to antigen-presenting cells. recall that all other nucleated cells of the body expressed mhc i molecules, which signal healthy or normal. lymphocytes in human circulating blood are approximately 80 to 90 percent t cells, shown in [link], and 10 to 20 percent b cells. recall that the t cells are involved in the cell-mediated immune response, whereas b cells are part of the humoral immune response. t cells encompass a heterogeneous population of cells with extremely diverse functions. some t cells respond to apcs of the innate immune system, and indirectly induce immune responses by releasing cytokines. other t cells stimulate b cells to prepare their own response. another population of t cells detects apc signals and directly kills the infected cells. other t cells are involved in suppressing inappropriate immune reactions to harmless or self antigens. t and b cells exhibit a common theme of recognition/binding of specific antigens via a complementary receptor, followed by activation and self-amplification/maturation to specifically bind to the particular antigen of the infecting pathogen. t and b lymphocytes are also similar in that each cell only expresses one type of antigen receptor. any individual may possess a population of t and b cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing virtually any infecting pathogen. t and b cells are activated when they recognize small components of antigens, called epitopes, presented by apcs, illustrated in [link]. note that recognition occurs at a specific epitope rather than on the entire antigen; for this reason, epitopes are known as antigenic determinants. in the absence of information from apcs, t and b cells remain inactive, or nave, and are unable to prepare an immune response. the requirement for information from the apcs of innate immunity to trigger b cell or t cell activation illustrates the essential nature of the innate immune response to the functioning of the entire immune system. nave t cells can express one of two different molecules, cd4 or cd8, on their surface, as shown in [link], and are accordingly classified as cd4+ or cd8+ cells. these molecules are important because they regulate how a t cell will interact with and respond to an apc. nave cd4+ cells bind apcs via their antigen-embedded mhc ii molecules and are stimulated to become helper t (th) lymphocytes, cells that go on to stimulate b cells (or cytotoxic t cells) directly or secrete cytokines to inform more and various target cells about the pathogenic threat. in contrast, cd8+ cells engage antigen-embedded mhc i molecules on apcs and are stimulated to become cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls), which directly kill infected cells by apoptosis and emit cytokines to amplify the immune response. the two populations of t cells have different mechanisms of immune protection, but both bind mhc molecules via their antigen receptors called t cell receptors (tcrs). the cd4 or cd8 surface molecules differentiate whether the tcr will engage an mhc ii or an mhc i molecule. because they assist in binding specificity, the cd4 and cd8 molecules are described as coreceptors. consider the innumerable possible antigens that an individual will be exposed to during a lifetime. the mammalian adaptive immune system is adept in responding appropriately to each antigen. mammals have an enormous diversity of t cell populations, resulting from the diversity of tcrs. each tcr consists of two polypeptide chains that span the t cell membrane, as illustrated in [link]; the chains are linked by a disulfide bridge. each polypeptide chain is comprised of a constant domain and a variable domain: a domain, in this sense, is a specific region of a protein that may be regulatory or structural. the intracellular domain is involved in intracellular signaling. a single t cell will express thousands of identical copies of one specific tcr variant on its cell surface. the specificity of the adaptive immune system occurs because it synthesizes millions of different t cell populations, each expressing a tcr that differs in its variable domain. this tcr diversity is achieved by the mutation and recombination of genes that encode these receptors in stem cell precursors of t cells. the binding between an antigen-displaying mhc molecule and a complementary tcr match indicates that the adaptive immune system needs to activate and produce that specific t cell because its structure is appropriate to recognize and destroy the invading pathogen. the th lymphocytes function indirectly to identify potential pathogens for other cells of the immune system. these cells are important for extracellular infections, such as those caused by certain bacteria, helminths, and protozoa. th lymphocytes recognize specific antigens displayed in the mhc ii complexes of apcs. there are two major populations of th cells: th1 and th2. th1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other t cells. th1 cells activate the action of cyotoxic t cells, as well as macrophages. th2 cells stimulate nave b cells to destroy foreign invaders via antibody secretion. whether a th1 or a th2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells of the innate immune system, which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen. the th1-mediated response involves macrophages and is associated with inflammation. recall the frontline defenses of macrophages involved in the innate immune response. some intracellular bacteria, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, have evolved to multiply in macrophages after they have been engulfed. these pathogens evade attempts by macrophages to destroy and digest the pathogen. when m. tuberculosis infection occurs, macrophages can stimulate nave t cells to become th1 cells. these stimulated t cells secrete specific cytokines that send feedback to the macrophage to stimulate its digestive capabilities and allow it to destroy the colonizing m. tuberculosis. in the same manner, th1-activated macrophages also become better suited to ingest and kill tumor cells. in summary; th1 responses are directed toward intracellular invaders while th2 responses are aimed at those that are extracellular. when stimulated by the th2 pathway, nave b cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. a plasma cell is an immune cell that secrets antibodies; these cells arise from b cells that were stimulated by antigens. similar to t cells, nave b cells initially are coated in thousands of b cell receptors (bcrs), which are membrane-bound forms of ig (immunoglobulin, or an antibody). the b cell receptor has two heavy chains and two light chains connected by disulfide linkages. each chain has a constant and a variable region; the latter is involved in antigen binding. two other membrane proteins, ig alpha and ig beta, are involved in signaling. the receptors of any particular b cell, as shown in [link] are all the same, but the hundreds of millions of different b cells in an individual have distinct recognition domains that contribute to extensive diversity in the types of molecular structures to which they can bind. in this state, b cells function as apcs. they bind and engulf foreign antigens via their bcrs and then display processed antigens in the context of mhc ii molecules to th2 cells. when a th2 cell detects that a b cell is bound to a relevant antigen, it secretes specific cytokines that induce the b cell to proliferate rapidly, which makes thousands of identical (clonal) copies of it, and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the bcrs. the activation of b cells corresponding to one specific bcr variant and the dramatic proliferation of that variant is known as clonal selection. this phenomenon drastically, but briefly, changes the proportions of bcr variants expressed by the immune system, and shifts the balance toward bcrs specific to the infecting pathogen. t and b cells differ in one fundamental way: whereas t cells bind antigens that have been digested and embedded in mhc molecules by apcs, b cells function as apcs that bind intact antigens that have not been processed. although t and b cells both react with molecules that are termed antigens, these lymphocytes actually respond to very different types of molecules. b cells must be able to bind intact antigens because they secrete antibodies that must recognize the pathogen directly, rather than digested remnants of the pathogen. bacterial carbohydrate and lipid molecules can activate b cells independently from the t cells. ctls, a subclass of t cells, function to clear infections directly. the cell-mediated part of the adaptive immune system consists of ctls that attack and destroy infected cells. ctls are particularly important in protecting against viral infections; this is because viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular contact with circulating antibodies. when apcs phagocytize pathogens and present mhc i-embedded antigens to nave cd8+ t cells that express complementary tcrs, the cd8+ t cells become activated to proliferate according to clonal selection. these resulting ctls then identify non-apcs displaying the same mhc i-embedded antigens (for example, viral proteins)for example, the ctls identify infected host cells. intracellularly, infected cells typically die after the infecting pathogen replicates to a sufficient concentration and lyses the cell, as many viruses do. ctls attempt to identify and destroy infected cells before the pathogen can replicate and escape, thereby halting the progression of intracellular infections. ctls also support nk lymphocytes to destroy early cancers. cytokines secreted by the th1 response that stimulates macrophages also stimulate ctls and enhance their ability to identify and destroy infected cells and tumors. ctls sense mhc i-embedded antigens by directly interacting with infected cells via their tcrs. binding of tcrs with antigens activates ctls to release perforin and granzyme, degradative enzymes that will induce apoptosis of the infected cell. recall that this is a similar destruction mechanism to that used by nk cells. in this process, the ctl does not become infected and is not harmed by the secretion of perforin and granzymes. in fact, the functions of nk cells and ctls are complementary and maximize the removal of infected cells, as illustrated in [link]. if the nk cell cannot identify the missing self pattern of down-regulated mhc i molecules, then the ctl can identify it by the complex of mhc i with foreign antigens, which signals altered self. similarly, if the ctl cannot detect antigen-embedded mhc i because the receptors are depleted from the cell surface, nk cells will destroy the cell instead. ctls also emit cytokines, such as interferons, that alter surface protein expression in other infected cells, such that the infected cells can be easily identified and destroyed. moreover, these interferons can also prevent virally infected cells from releasing virus particles. plasma cells and ctls are collectively called effector cells: they represent differentiated versions of their nave counterparts, and they are involved in bringing about the immune defense of killing pathogens and infected host cells. the innate and adaptive immune responses discussed thus far comprise the systemic immune system (affecting the whole body), which is distinct from the mucosal immune system. mucosal immunity is formed by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, which functions independently of the systemic immune system, and which has its own innate and adaptive components. mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (malt), illustrated in [link], is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body. this tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment. the systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell types. foreign particles that make their way to malt are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells called m cells and delivered to apcs located directly below the mucosal tissue. m cells function in the transport described, and are located in the peyers patch, a lymphoid nodule. apcs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells, with b cells and macrophages having minor roles. processed antigens displayed on apcs are detected by t cells in the malt and at various mucosal induction sites, such as the tonsils, adenoids, appendix, or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the intestine. activated t cells then migrate through the lymphatic system and into the circulatory system to mucosal sites of infection. malt is a crucial component of a functional immune system because mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal passages, are the first tissues onto which inhaled or ingested pathogens are deposited. the mucosal tissue includes the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus, and the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts. the immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful, unnecessary responses to harmless substances, and more importantly so that it does not attack self. the acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease is described as immune tolerance. immune tolerance is crucial for maintaining mucosal homeostasis given the tremendous number of foreign substances (such as food proteins) that apcs of the oral cavity, pharynx, and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter. immune tolerance is brought about by specialized apcs in the liver, lymph nodes, small intestine, and lung that present harmless antigens to an exceptionally diverse population of regulatory t (treg) cells, specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors. the combined result of treg cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead. in addition to promoting immune tolerance of harmless antigens, other subsets of treg cells are involved in the prevention of the autoimmune response, which is an inappropriate immune response to host cells or self-antigens. another treg class suppresses immune responses to harmful pathogens after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis. the adaptive immune system possesses a memory component that allows for an efficient and dramatic response upon reinvasion of the same pathogen. memory is handled by the adaptive immune system with little reliance on cues from the innate response. during the adaptive immune response to a pathogen that has not been encountered before, called a primary response, plasma cells secreting antibodies and differentiated t cells increase, then plateau over time. as b and t cells mature into effector cells, a subset of the nave populations differentiates into b and t memory cells with the same antigen specificities, as illustrated in [link]. a memory cell is an antigen-specific b or t lymphocyte that does not differentiate into effector cells during the primary immune response, but that can immediately become effector cells upon re-exposure to the same pathogen. during the primary immune response, memory cells do not respond to antigens and do not contribute to host defenses. as the infection is cleared and pathogenic stimuli subside, the effectors are no longer needed, and they undergo apoptosis. in contrast, the memory cells persist in the circulation. if the pathogen is never encountered again during the individuals lifetime, b and t memory cells will circulate for a few years or even several decades and will gradually die off, having never functioned as effector cells. however, if the host is re-exposed to the same pathogen type, circulating memory cells will immediately differentiate into plasma cells and ctls without input from apcs or th cells. one reason the adaptive immune response is delayed is because it takes time for nave b and t cells with the appropriate antigen specificities to be identified and activated. upon reinfection, this step is skipped, and the result is a more rapid production of immune defenses. memory b cells that differentiate into plasma cells output tens to hundreds-fold greater antibody amounts than were secreted during the primary response, as the graph in [link] illustrates. this rapid and dramatic antibody response may stop the infection before it can even become established, and the individual may not realize they had been exposed. vaccination is based on the knowledge that exposure to noninfectious antigens, derived from known pathogens, generates a mild primary immune response. the immune response to vaccination may not be perceived by the host as illness but still confers immune memory. when exposed to the corresponding pathogen to which an individual was vaccinated, the reaction is similar to a secondary exposure. because each reinfection generates more memory cells and increased resistance to the pathogen, and because some memory cells die, certain vaccine courses involve one or more booster vaccinations to mimic repeat exposures: for instance, tetanus boosters are necessary every ten years because the memory cells only live that long. a subset of t and b cells of the mucosal immune system differentiates into memory cells just as in the systemic immune system. upon reinvasion of the same pathogen type, a pronounced immune response occurs at the mucosal site where the original pathogen deposited, but a collective defense is also organized within interconnected or adjacent mucosal tissue. for instance, the immune memory of an infection in the oral cavity would also elicit a response in the pharynx if the oral cavity was exposed to the same pathogen. vaccinologistvaccination (or immunization) involves the delivery, usually by injection as shown in [link], of noninfectious antigen(s) derived from known pathogens. other components, called adjuvants, are delivered in parallel to help stimulate the immune response. immunological memory is the reason vaccines work. ideally, the effect of vaccination is to elicit immunological memory, and thus resistance to specific pathogens without the individual having to experience an infection. vaccinologists are involved in the process of vaccine development from the initial idea to the availability of the completed vaccine. this process can take decades, can cost millions of dollars, and can involve many obstacles along the way. for instance, injected vaccines stimulate the systemic immune system, eliciting humoral and cell-mediated immunity, but have little effect on the mucosal response, which presents a challenge because many pathogens are deposited and replicate in mucosal compartments, and the injection does not provide the most efficient immune memory for these disease agents. for this reason, vaccinologists are actively involved in developing new vaccines that are applied via intranasal, aerosol, oral, or transcutaneous (absorbed through the skin) delivery methods. importantly, mucosal-administered vaccines elicit both mucosal and systemic immunity and produce the same level of disease resistance as injected vaccines. currently, a version of intranasal influenza vaccine is available, and the polio and typhoid vaccines can be administered orally, as shown in [link]. similarly, the measles and rubella vaccines are being adapted to aerosol delivery using inhalation devices. eventually, transgenic plants may be engineered to produce vaccine antigens that can be eaten to confer disease resistance. other vaccines may be adapted to rectal or vaginal application to elicit immune responses in rectal, genitourinary, or reproductive mucosa. finally, vaccine antigens may be adapted to transdermal application in which the skin is lightly scraped and microneedles are used to pierce the outermost layer. in addition to mobilizing the mucosal immune response, this new generation of vaccines may end the anxiety associated with injections and, in turn, improve patient participation. although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites. the blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors through the body. approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which encompass monocytes (the precursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes. the majority of cells in the blood are erythrocytes (red blood cells). lymph is a watery fluid that bathes tissues and organs with protective white blood cells and does not contain erythrocytes. cells of the immune system can travel between the distinct lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, which are separated by interstitial space, by a process called extravasation (passing through to surrounding tissue). the cells of the immune system originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. cytokines stimulate these stem cells to differentiate into immune cells. b cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow, whereas nave t cells transit from the bone marrow to the thymus for maturation. in the thymus, immature t cells that express tcrs complementary to self-antigens are destroyed. this process helps prevent autoimmune responses. on maturation, t and b lymphocytes circulate to various destinations. lymph nodes scattered throughout the body, as illustrated in [link], house large populations of t and b cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. lymph gathers antigens as it drains from tissues. these antigens then are filtered through lymph nodes before the lymph is returned to circulation. apcs in the lymph nodes capture and process antigens and inform nearby lymphocytes about potential pathogens. the spleen houses b and t cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and nk cells. the spleen, shown in [link], is the site where apcs that have trapped foreign particles in the blood can communicate with lymphocytes. antibodies are synthesized and secreted by activated plasma cells in the spleen, and the spleen filters foreign substances and antibody-complexed pathogens from the blood. functionally, the spleen is to the blood as lymph nodes are to the lymph. the adaptive immune response is a slower-acting, longer-lasting, and more specific response than the innate response. however, the adaptive response requires information from the innate immune system to function. apcs display antigens via mhc molecules to complementary nave t cells. in response, the t cells differentiate and proliferate, becoming th cells or ctls. th cells stimulate b cells that have engulfed and presented pathogen-derived antigens. b cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies, whereas ctls induce apoptosis in intracellularly infected or cancerous cells. memory cells persist after a primary exposure to a pathogen. if re-exposure occurs, memory cells differentiate into effector cells without input from the innate immune system. the mucosal immune system is largely independent from the systemic immune system but functions in a parallel fashion to protect the extensive mucosal surfaces of the body.","[('immune system', 'immune systems'), ('autoimmune response', 'autoimmune

220,stax-bio,42,The Immune System,3,m44823,Antibodies,"an antibody, also known as an immunoglobulin (ig), is a protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen. antibodies are the functional basis of humoral immunity. antibodies occur in the blood, in gastric and mucus secretions, and in breast milk. antibodies in these bodily fluids can bind pathogens and mark them for destruction by phagocytes before they can infect cells. an antibody molecule is comprised of four polypeptides: two identical heavy chains (large peptide units) that are partially bound to each other in a y formation, which are flanked by two identical light chains (small peptide units), as illustrated in [link]. bonds between the cysteine amino acids in the antibody molecule attach the polypeptides to each other. the areas where the antigen is recognized on the antibody are variable domains and the antibody base is composed of constant domains. in germ-line b cells, the variable region of the light chain gene has 40 variable (v) and five joining (j) segments. an enzyme called dna recombinase randomly excises most of these segments out of the gene, and splices one v segment to one j segment. during rna processing, all but one v and j segment are spliced out. recombination and splicing may result in over 106 possible vj combinations. as a result, each differentiated b cell in the human body typically has a unique variable chain. the constant domain, which does not bind antibody, is the same for all antibodies. similar to tcrs and bcrs, antibody diversity is produced by the mutation and recombination of approximately 300 different gene segments encoding the light and heavy chain variable domains in precursor cells that are destined to become b cells. the variable domains from the heavy and light chains interact to form the binding site through which an antibody can bind a specific epitope on an antigen. the numbers of repeated constant domains in ig classes are the same for all antibodies corresponding to a specific class. antibodies are structurally similar to the extracellular component of the bcrs, and b cell maturation to plasma cells can be visualized in simple terms as the cell acquires the ability to secrete the extracellular portion of its bcr in large quantities. antibodies can be divided into five classesigm, igg, iga, igd, igebased on their physiochemical, structural, and immunological properties. iggs, which make up about 80 percent of all antibodies, have heavy chains that consist of one variable domain and three identical constant domains. iga and igd also have three constant domains per heavy chain, whereas igm and ige each have four constant domains per heavy chain. the variable domain determines binding specificity and the constant domain of the heavy chain determines the immunological mechanism of action of the corresponding antibody class. it is possible for two antibodies to have the same binding specificities but be in different classes and, therefore, to be involved in different functions. after an adaptive defense is produced against a pathogen, typically plasma cells first secrete igm into the blood. bcrs on nave b cells are of the igm class and occasionally igd class. igm molecules make up approximately ten percent of all antibodies. prior to antibody secretion, plasma cells assemble igm molecules into pentamers (five individual antibodies) linked by a joining (j) chain, as shown in [link]. the pentamer arrangement means that these macromolecules can bind ten identical antigens. however, igm molecules released early in the adaptive immune response do not bind to antigens as stably as iggs, which are one of the possible types of antibodies secreted in large quantities upon re-exposure to the same pathogen. [link] summarizes the properties of immunoglobulins and illustrates their basic structures. igas populate the saliva, tears, breast milk, and mucus secretions of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts. collectively, these bodily fluids coat and protect the extensive mucosa (4000 square feet in humans). the total number of iga molecules in these bodily secretions is greater than the number of igg molecules in the blood serum. a small amount of iga is also secreted into the serum in monomeric form. conversely, some igm is secreted into bodily fluids of the mucosa. similar to igm, iga molecules are secreted as polymeric structures linked with a j chain. however, igas are secreted mostly as dimeric molecules, not pentamers. ige is present in the serum in small quantities and is best characterized in its role as an allergy mediator. igd is also present in small quantities. similar to igm, bcrs of the igd class are found on the surface of nave b cells. this class supports antigen recognition and maturation of b cells to plasma cells. differentiated plasma cells are crucial players in the humoral response, and the antibodies they secrete are particularly significant against extracellular pathogens and toxins. antibodies circulate freely and act independently of plasma cells. antibodies can be transferred from one individual to another to temporarily protect against infectious disease. for instance, a person who has recently produced a successful immune response against a particular disease agent can donate blood to a nonimmune recipient and confer temporary immunity through antibodies in the donors blood serum. this phenomenon is called passive immunity; it also occurs naturally during breastfeeding, which makes breastfed infants highly resistant to infections during the first few months of life. antibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them, as illustrated in [link], by blocking key sites on the pathogen that enhance their infectivity (such as receptors that dock pathogens on host cells). antibody neutralization can prevent pathogens from entering and infecting host cells, as opposed to the ctl-mediated approach of killing cells that are already infected to prevent progression of an established infection. the neutralized antibody-coated pathogens can then be filtered by the spleen and eliminated in urine or feces. antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils, because phagocytic cells are highly attracted to macromolecules complexed with antibodies. phagocytic enhancement by antibodies is called opsonization. in a process called complement fixation, igm and igg in serum bind to antigens and provide docking sites onto which sequential complement proteins can bind. the combination of antibodies and complement enhances opsonization even further and promotes rapid clearing of pathogens. not all antibodies bind with the same strength, specificity, and stability. in fact, antibodies exhibit different affinities (attraction) depending on the molecular complementarity between antigen and antibody molecules, as illustrated in [link]. an antibody with a higher affinity for a particular antigen would bind more strongly and stably, and thus would be expected to present a more challenging defense against the pathogen corresponding to the specific antigen. the term avidity describes binding by antibody classes that are secreted as joined, multivalent structures (such as igm and iga). although avidity measures the strength of binding, just as affinity does, the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure. the avidity depends on the number of identical binding sites on the antigen being detected, as well as other physical and chemical factors. typically, multimeric antibodies, such as pentameric igm, are classified as having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies, but high avidity. essentially, the fact that multimeric antibodies can bind many antigens simultaneously balances their slightly lower binding strength for each antibody/antigen interaction. antibodies secreted after binding to one epitope on an antigen may exhibit cross reactivity for the same or similar epitopes on different antigens. because an epitope corresponds to such a small region (the surface area of about four to six amino acids), it is possible for different macromolecules to exhibit the same molecular identities and orientations over short regions. cross reactivity describes when an antibody binds not to the antigen that elicited its synthesis and secretion, but to a different antigen. cross reactivity can be beneficial if an individual develops immunity to several related pathogens despite having only been exposed to or vaccinated against one of them. for instance, antibody cross reactivity may occur against the similar surface structures of various gram-negative bacteria. conversely, antibodies raised against pathogenic molecular components that resemble self molecules may incorrectly mark host cells for destruction and cause autoimmune damage. patients who develop systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) commonly exhibit antibodies that react with their own dna. these antibodies may have been initially raised against the nucleic acid of microorganisms but later cross-reacted with self-antigens. this phenomenon is also called molecular mimicry. antibodies synthesized by the mucosal immune system include iga and igm. activated b cells differentiate into mucosal plasma cells that synthesize and secrete dimeric iga, and to a lesser extent, pentameric igm. secreted iga is abundant in tears, saliva, breast milk, and in secretions of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. antibody secretion results in a local humoral response at epithelial surfaces and prevents infection of the mucosa by binding and neutralizing pathogens. antibodies (immunoglobulins) are the molecules secreted from plasma cells that mediate the humoral immune response. there are five antibody classes; an antibody's class determines its mechanism of action and production site but does not control its binding specificity. antibodies bind antigens via variable domains and can either neutralize pathogens or mark them for phagocytosis or activate the complement cascade.","[('immune system', 'immune systems'), ('affinity', 'affinities'), ('antibody structure', 'antibody structures'), ('antibody', 'antibodiess', 'antibodies'), ('cross reactivity', 'cross reactivities'), ('passive immunity', 'passive immunities'), ('immunity', 'immunities'), ('avidity', 'avidities'), ('antibody', 'antibodies'), ('antibody clas', 'antibody classes', 'antibody class'), ('enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay', 'enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays', 'enzyme-linkeds immunosorbent assay', 'enzyme-linkeds immunosorbent assays'), ('immune response', 'immune responses'), ('antibody function', 'antibody functions'), ('elisa', 'elisas')]"
221,stax-bio,42,The Immune System,4,m44831,Disruptions in the Immune System,"a functioning immune system is essential for survival, but even the sophisticated cellular and molecular defenses of the mammalian immune response can be defeated by pathogens at virtually every step. in the competition between immune protection and pathogen evasion, pathogens have the advantage of more rapid evolution because of their shorter generation time and other characteristics. for instance, streptococcus pneumoniae (bacterium that cause pneumonia and meningitis) surrounds itself with a capsule that inhibits phagocytes from engulfing it and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune system. staphylococcus aureus (bacterium that can cause skin infections, abscesses, and meningitis) synthesizes a toxin called leukocidin that kills phagocytes after they engulf the bacterium. other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system. hiv infects th cells via their cd4 surface molecules, gradually depleting the number of th cells in the body; this inhibits the adaptive immune systems capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors. as a result, hiv-infected individuals often suffer from infections that would not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but which can cause devastating illness to immune-compromised individuals. maladaptive responses of immune cells and molecules themselves can also disrupt the proper functioning of the entire system, leading to host cell damage that could become fatal. failures, insufficiencies, or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and replicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed. immunodeficiency is the failure, insufficiency, or delay in the response of the immune system, which may be acquired or inherited. immunodeficiency can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens (such as hiv), chemical exposure (including certain medical treatments), malnutrition, or possibly by extreme stress. for instance, radiation exposure can destroy populations of lymphocytes and elevate an individuals susceptibility to infections and cancer. dozens of genetic disorders result in immunodeficiencies, including severe combined immunodeficiency (scid), bare lymphocyte syndrome, and mhc ii deficiencies. rarely, primary immunodeficiencies that are present from birth may occur. neutropenia is one form in which the immune system produces a below-average number of neutrophils, the bodys most abundant phagocytes. as a result, bacterial infections may go unrestricted in the blood, causing serious complications. maladaptive immune responses toward harmless foreign substances or self antigens that occur after tissue sensitization are termed hypersensitivities. the types of hypersensitivities include immediate, delayed, and autoimmunity. a large proportion of the population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity. the immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a harmless antigen is called an allergy. in the united states, 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens. upon initial exposure to a potential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the ige class via the typical process of apcs presenting processed antigen to th cells that stimulate b cells to produce ige. this class of antibodies also mediates the immune response to parasitic worms. the constant domain of the ige molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues. this process primes, or sensitizes, the tissue. upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, ige molecules on mast cells bind the antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids histamine and serotonin; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses. [link] shows an example of an allergic response to ragweed pollen. the effects of an allergic reaction range from mild symptoms like sneezing and itchy, watery eyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy welts or hives, airway contraction with severe respiratory distress, and plummeting blood pressure. this extreme reaction is known as anaphylactic shock. if not treated with epinephrine to counter the blood pressure and breathing effects, this condition can be fatal. delayed hypersensitivity is a cell-mediated immune response that takes approximately one to two days after secondary exposure for a maximal reaction to be observed. this type of hypersensitivity involves the th1 cytokine-mediated inflammatory response and may manifest as local tissue lesions or contact dermatitis (rash or skin irritation). delayed hypersensitivity occurs in some individuals in response to contact with certain types of jewelry or cosmetics. delayed hypersensitivity facilitates the immune response to poison ivy and is also the reason why the skin test for tuberculosis results in a small region of inflammation on individuals who were previously exposed to mycobacterium tuberculosis. that is also why cortisone is used to treat such responses: it will inhibit cytokine production. autoimmunity is a type of hypersensitivity to self antigens that affects approximately five percent of the population. most types of autoimmunity involve the humoral immune response. antibodies that inappropriately mark self components as foreign are termed autoantibodies. in patients with the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, muscle cell receptors that induce contraction in response to acetylcholine are targeted by antibodies. the result is muscle weakness that may include marked difficultly with fine and/or gross motor functions. in systemic lupus erythematosus, a diffuse autoantibody response to the individuals own dna and proteins results in various systemic diseases. as illustrated in [link], systemic lupus erythematosus may affect the heart, joints, lungs, skin, kidneys, central nervous system, or other tissues, causing tissue damage via antibody binding, complement recruitment, lysis, and inflammation. autoimmunity can develop with time, and its causes may be rooted in molecular mimicry. antibodies and tcrs may bind self antigens that are structurally similar to pathogen antigens, which the immune receptors first raised. as an example, infection with streptococcus pyogenes (bacterium that causes strep throat) may generate antibodies or t cells that react with heart muscle, which has a similar structure to the surface of s. pyogenes. these antibodies can damage heart muscle with autoimmune attacks, leading to rheumatic fever. insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus arises from a destructive inflammatory th1 response against insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. patients with this autoimmunity must be injected with insulin that originates from other sources. immune disruptions may involve insufficient immune responses or inappropriate immune targets. immunodeficiency increases an individual's susceptibility to infections and cancers. hypersensitivities are misdirected responses either to harmless foreign particles, as in the case of allergies, or to host factors, as in the case of autoimmunity. reactions to self components may be the result of molecular mimicry.","[('immune system', 'immune systems'), ('immunodeficiency', 'immunodeficiencies'), ('allergy', 'allergies'), ('hypersensitivity', 'hypersensitivitiess', 'hypersensitivities'), ('autoimmunity', 'autoimmunities'), ('immunity', 'immunities'), ('immune response', 'immune responses'), ('autoantibody', 'autoantibodies'), ('allergy', 'allergiess', 'allergies'), ('hypersensitivity', 'hypersensitivities')]"

into the environment for external fertilization. seahorses, like the one shown in [link], provide an example of the latter. following a mating dance, the female lays eggs in the male seahorses

223,stax-bio,43,Animal Reproduction and Development,1,m44836,Reproduction Methods,"animals produce offspring through asexual and/or sexual reproduction. both methods have advantages and disadvantages. asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent. a single individual can produce offspring asexually and large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly. in a stable or predictable environment, asexual reproduction is an effective means of reproduction because all the offspring will be adapted to that environment. in an unstable or unpredictable environment asexually-reproducing species may be at a disadvantage because all the offspring are genetically identical and may not have the genetic variation to survive in new or different conditions. on the other hand, the rapid rates of asexual reproduction may allow for a speedy response to environmental changes if individuals have mutations. an additional advantage of asexual reproduction is that colonization of new habitats may be easier when an individual does not need to find a mate to reproduce. during sexual reproduction the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring that differ from their parents. the genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is thought to give species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment. species that reproduce sexually must maintain two different types of individuals, males and females, which can limit the ability to colonize new habitats as both sexes must be present. asexual reproduction occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria) and in some eukaryotic single-celled and multi-celled organisms. there are a number of ways that animals reproduce asexually. fission, also called binary fission, occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms and in some invertebrate, multi-celled organisms. after a period of growth, an organism splits into two separate organisms. some unicellular eukaryotic organisms undergo binary fission by mitosis. in other organisms, part of the individual separates and forms a second individual. this process occurs, for example, in many asteroid echinoderms through splitting of the central disk. some sea anemones and some coral polyps ([link]) also reproduce through fission. budding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of a cell or body region leading to a separation from the original organism into two individuals. budding occurs commonly in some invertebrate animals such as corals and hydras. in hydras, a bud forms that develops into an adult and breaks away from the main body, as illustrated in [link], whereas in coral budding, the bud does not detach and multiplies as part of a new colony. watch a video of a hydra budding.

 fragmentation is the breaking of the body into two parts with subsequent regeneration. if the animal is capable of fragmentation, and the part is big enough, a separate individual will regrow. for example, in many sea stars, asexual reproduction is accomplished by fragmentation. [link] illustrates a sea star for which an arm of the individual is broken off and regenerates a new sea star. fisheries workers have been known to try to kill the sea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and throwing them back into the ocean. unfortunately for the workers, the two parts can each regenerate a new half, resulting in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters and clams. fragmentation also occurs in annelid worms, turbellarians, and poriferans. note that in fragmentation, there is generally a noticeable difference in the size of the individuals, whereas in fission, two individuals of approximate size are formed. parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction where an egg develops into a complete individual without being fertilized. the resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid, depending on the process and the species. parthenogenesis occurs in invertebrates such as water flees, rotifers, aphids, stick insects, some ants, wasps, and bees. bees use parthenogenesis to produce haploid males (drones). if eggs are fertilized, diploid females develop, and if the fertilized eggs are fed special diet (so called royal jelly), a queen is produced. some vertebrate animalssuch as certain reptiles, amphibians, and fishalso reproduce through parthenogenesis. although more common in plants, parthenogenesis has been observed in animal species that were segregated by sex in terrestrial or marine zoos. two female komodo dragons, a hammerhead shark, and a blacktop shark have produced parthenogenic young when the females have been isolated from males. sexual reproduction is the combination of (usually haploid) reproductive cells from two individuals to form a third (usually diploid) unique offspring. sexual reproduction produces offspring with novel combinations of genes. this can be an adaptive advantage in unstable or unpredictable environments. as humans, we are used to thinking of animals as having two separate sexesmale and femaledetermined at conception. however, in the animal kingdom, there are many variations on this theme. hermaphroditism occurs in animals where one individual has both male and female reproductive parts. invertebrates such as earthworms, slugs, tapeworms and snails, shown in [link], are often hermaphroditic. hermaphrodites may self-fertilize or may mate with another of their species, fertilizing each other and both producing offspring. self fertilization is common in animals that have limited mobility or are not motile, such as barnacles and clams. mammalian sex determination is determined genetically by the presence of x and y chromosomes. individuals homozygous for x (xx) are female and heterozygous individuals (xy) are male. the presence of a y chromosome causes the development of male characteristics and its absence results in female characteristics. the xy system is also found in some insects and plants. avian sex determination is dependent on the presence of z and w chromosomes. homozygous for z (zz) results in a male and heterozygous (zw) results in a female. the w appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar to the y chromosome in mammals. some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use this system. the sex of some species is not determined by genetics but by some aspect of the environment. sex determination in some crocodiles and turtles, for example, is often dependent on the temperature during critical periods of egg development. this is referred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically as temperature-dependent sex determination. in many turtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females. in some crocodiles, moderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females. in some species, sex is both genetic- and temperature-dependent. individuals of some species change their sex during their lives, alternating between male and female. if the individual is female first, it is termed protogyny or first female, if it is male first, its termed protandry or first male. oysters, for example, are born male, grow, and become female and lay eggs; some oyster species change sex multiple times. reproduction may be asexual when one individual produces genetically identical offspring, or sexual when the genetic material from two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring. asexual reproduction occurs through fission, budding, and fragmentation. sexual reproduction may mean the joining of sperm and eggs within animals bodies or it may mean the release of sperm and eggs into the environment. an individual may be one sex, or both; it may start out as one sex and switch during its life, or it may stay male or female.","[('reproduction', 'reproductions'), ('binary fission', 'binary fissions'), ('parthenogenesi', 'parthenogeneses', 'parthenogenesis'), ('asexual reproduction', 'asexual reproductions'), ('fragmentation', 'fragmentations'), ('animal reproduction', 'animal reproductions'), ('hermaphroditism', 'hermaphroditisms'), ('sex determination', 'sex determinations'), ('fission', 'fissions'), ('sexual reproduction', 'sexual reproductions'), ('budding', 'buddings'), ('animal development', 'animal developments')]"
224,stax-bio,43,Animal Reproduction and Development,2,m44838,Fertilization,"sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. this can occur either inside (internal fertilization) or outside (external fertilization) the body of the female. humans provide an example of the former whereas seahorse reproduction is an example of the latter. external fertilization usually occurs in aquatic environments where both eggs and sperm are released into the water. after the sperm reaches the egg, fertilization takes place. most external fertilization happens during the process of spawning where one or several females release their eggs and the male(s) release sperm in the same area, at the same time. the release of the reproductive material may be triggered by water temperature or the length of daylight. nearly all fish spawn, as do crustaceans (such as crabs and shrimp), mollusks (such as oysters), squid, and echinoderms (such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers). [link] shows salmon spawning in a shallow stream. frogs, like those shown in [link], corals, molluscs, and sea cucumbers also spawn. pairs of fish that are not broadcast spawners may exhibit courtship behavior. this allows the female to select a particular male. the trigger for egg and sperm release (spawning) causes the egg and sperm to be placed in a small area, enhancing the possibility of fertilization. external fertilization in an aquatic environment protects the eggs from drying out. broadcast spawning can result in a greater mixture of the genes within a group, leading to higher genetic diversity and a greater chance of species survival in a hostile environment. for sessile aquatic organisms like sponges, broadcast spawning is the only mechanism for fertilization and colonization of new environments. the presence of the fertilized eggs and developing young in the water provides opportunities for predation resulting in a loss of offspring. therefore, millions of eggs must be produced by individuals, and the offspring produced through this method must mature rapidly. the survival rate of eggs produced through broadcast spawning is low. internal fertilization occurs most often in land-based animals, although some aquatic animals also use this method. there are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization. in oviparity, fertilized eggs are laid outside the females body and develop there, receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg. this occurs in most bony fish, many reptiles, some cartilaginous fish, most amphibians, two mammals, and all birds. reptiles and insects produce leathery eggs, while birds and turtles produce eggs with high concentrations of calcium carbonate in the shell, making them hard. chicken eggs are an example of this second type. in ovoviparity, fertilized eggs are retained in the female, but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the eggs yolk and the young are fully developed when they are hatched. this occurs in some bony fish (like the guppy lebistes reticulatus), some sharks, some lizards, some snakes (such as the garter snake thamnophis sirtalis), some vipers, and some invertebrate animals (like the madagascar hissing cockroach gromphadorhina portentosa). in viviparity the young develop within the female, receiving nourishment from the mothers blood through a placenta. the offspring develops in the female and is born alive. this occurs in most mammals, some cartilaginous fish, and a few reptiles. internal fertilization has the advantage of protecting the fertilized egg from dehydration on land. the embryo is isolated within the female, which limits predation on the young. internal fertilization enhances the fertilization of eggs by a specific male. fewer offspring are produced through this method, but their survival rate is higher than that for external fertilization. once multicellular organisms evolved and developed specialized cells, some also developed tissues and organs with specialized functions. an early development in reproduction occurred in the annelids. these organisms produce sperm and eggs from undifferentiated cells in their coelom and store them in that cavity. when the coelom becomes filled, the cells are released through an excretory opening or by the body splitting open. reproductive organs evolved with the development of gonads that produce sperm and eggs. these cells went through meiosis, an adaption of mitosis, which reduced the number of chromosomes in each reproductive cell by half, while increasing the number of cells through cell division. complete reproductive systems were developed in insects, with separate sexes. sperm are made in testes and then travel through coiled tubes to the epididymis for storage. eggs mature in the ovary. when they are released from the ovary, they travel to the uterine tubes for fertilization. some insects have a specialized sac, called a spermatheca, which stores sperm for later use, sometimes up to a year. fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival. vertebrates have similar structures, with a few differences. non-mammals, such as birds and reptiles, have a common body opening, called a cloaca, for the digestive, excretory and reproductive systems. coupling between birds usually involves positioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm. mammals have separate openings for the systems in the female and a uterus for support of developing offspring. the uterus has two chambers in species that produce large numbers of offspring at a time, while species that produce one offspring, such as primates, have a single uterus. sperm transfer from the male to the female during reproduction ranges from releasing the sperm into the watery environment for external fertilization, to the joining of cloaca in birds, to the development of a penis for direct delivery into the females vagina in mammals. sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. this can occur either outside the bodies or inside the female. both methods have advantages and disadvantages. once fertilized, the eggs can develop inside the female or outside. if the egg develops outside the body, it usually has a protective covering over it. animal anatomy evolved various ways to fertilize, hold, or expel the egg. the method of fertilization varies among animals. some species release the egg and sperm into the environment, some species retain the egg and receive the sperm into the female body and then expel the developing embryo covered with shell, while still other species retain the developing offspring through the gestation period.","[('fertilization', 'fertilizations'), ('internal fertilization', 'internal fertilizations'), ('viviparity', 'viviparities'), ('oviparity', 'oviparities'), ('spermatheca', 'spermathecas'),

225,stax-bio,43,Animal Reproduction and Development,3,m44839,Human Reproductive Anatomy and Gametogenesis,"as animals became more complex, specific organs and organ systems developed to support specific functions for the organism. the reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally, and support the growth and development of offspring. the reproductive tissues of male and female humans develop similarly in utero until a low level of the hormone testosterone is released from male gonads. testosterone causes the undeveloped tissues to differentiate into male sexual organs. when testosterone is absent, the tissues develop into female sexual tissues. primitive gonads become testes or ovaries. tissues that produce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females. the tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a female; that is, they are homologous structures. in the male reproductive system, the scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), including providing passage for blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. the testes are a pair of male reproductive organs that produce sperm and some reproductive hormones. each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 in) in size and divided into wedge-shaped lobules by connective tissue called septa. coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm. sperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the scrotum and penis are external to the body, as illustrated in [link] so that a proper temperature is maintained for motility. in land mammals, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the body at about 2 c lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm. infertility can occur in land mammals when the testes do not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development. sperm mature in seminiferous tubules that are coiled inside the testes, as illustrated in [link]. the walls of the seminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells, with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the tubule and the fully developed sperm in the lumen. the sperm cells are mixed with nursemaid cells called sertoli cells which protect the germ cells and promote their development. other cells mixed in the wall of the tubules are the interstitial cells of leydig. these cells produce high levels of testosterone once the male reaches adolescence. when the sperm have developed flagella and are nearly mature, they leave the testicles and enter the epididymis, shown in [link]. this structure resembles a comma and lies along the top and posterior portion of the testes; it is the site of sperm maturation. the sperm leave the epididymis and enter the vas deferens (or ductus deferens), which carries the sperm, behind the bladder, and forms the ejaculatory duct with the duct from the seminal vesicles. during a vasectomy, a section of the vas deferens is removed, preventing sperm from being passed out of the body during ejaculation and preventing fertilization. semen is a mixture of sperm and spermatic duct secretions (about 10 percent of the total) and fluids from accessory glands that contribute most of the semens volume. sperm are haploid cells, consisting of a flagellum as a tail, a neck that contains the cells energy-producing mitochondria, and a head that contains the genetic material. [link] shows a micrograph of human sperm as well as a diagram of the parts of the sperm. an acrosome is found at the top of the head of the sperm. this structure contains lysosomal enzymes that can digest the protective coverings that surround the egg to help the sperm penetrate and fertilize the egg. an ejaculate will contain from two to five milliliters of fluid with from 50120 million sperm per milliliter. the bulk of the semen comes from the accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system. these are the seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral gland, all of which are illustrated in [link]. the seminal vesicles are a pair of glands that lie along the posterior border of the urinary bladder. the glands make a solution that is thick, yellowish, and alkaline. as sperm are only motile in an alkaline environment, a basic ph is important to reverse the acidity of the vaginal environment. the solution also contains mucus, fructose (a sperm mitochondrial nutrient), a coagulating enzyme, ascorbic acid, and local-acting hormones called prostaglandins. the seminal vesicle glands account for 60 percent of the bulk of semen. the penis, illustrated in [link], is an organ that drains urine from the renal bladder and functions as a copulatory organ during intercourse. the penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ. these consist of a pair of tubes on the dorsal side, called the corpus cavernosum, and a single tube of tissue on the ventral side, called the corpus spongiosum. this tissue will become engorged with blood, becoming erect and hard, in preparation for intercourse. the organ is inserted into the vagina culminating with an ejaculation. during intercourse, the smooth muscle sphincters at the opening to the renal bladder close and prevent urine from entering the penis. an orgasm is a two-stage process: first, glands and accessory organs connected to the testes contract, then semen (containing sperm) is expelled through the urethra during ejaculation. after intercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes flaccid. the walnut-shaped prostate gland surrounds the urethra, the connection to the urinary bladder. it has a series of short ducts that directly connect to the urethra. the gland is a mixture of smooth muscle and glandular tissue. the muscle provides much of the force needed for ejaculation to occur. the glandular tissue makes a thin, milky fluid that contains citrate (a nutrient), enzymes, and prostate specific antigen (psa). psa is a proteolytic enzyme that helps to liquefy the ejaculate several minutes after release from the male. prostate gland secretions account for about 30 percent of the bulk of semen. the bulbourethral gland, or cowpers gland, releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen. it neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine. this usually accounts for a couple of drops of fluid in the total ejaculate and may contain a few sperm. withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation to prevent pregnancy may not work if sperm are present in the bulbourethral gland secretions. the location and functions of the male reproductive organs are summarized in [link]. a number of reproductive structures are exterior to the females body. these include the breasts and the vulva, which consists of the mons pubis, clitoris, labia majora, labia minora, and the vestibular glands, all illustrated in [link]. the location and functions of the female reproductive organs are summarized in [link]. the vulva is an area associated with the vestibule which includes the structures found in the inguinal (groin) area of women. the mons pubis is a round, fatty area that overlies the pubic symphysis. the clitoris is a structure with erectile tissue that contains a large number of sensory nerves and serves as a source of stimulation during intercourse. the labia majora are a pair of elongated folds of tissue that run posterior from the mons pubis and enclose the other components of the vulva. the labia majora derive from the same tissue that produces the scrotum in a male. the labia minora are thin folds of tissue centrally located within the labia majora. these labia protect the openings to the vagina and urethra. the mons pubis and the anterior portion of the labia majora become covered with hair during adolescence; the labia minora is hairless. the greater vestibular glands are found at the sides of the vaginal opening and provide lubrication during intercourse. the breasts consist of mammary glands and fat. the size of the breast is determined by the amount of fat deposited behind the gland. each gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes that have ducts that empty at the nipple and that supply the nursing child with nutrient- and antibody-rich milk to aid development and protect the child. internal female reproductive structures include ovaries, oviducts, the uterus, and the vagina, shown in [link]. the pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments. ovaries consist of a medulla and cortex: the medulla contains nerves and blood vessels to supply the cortex with nutrients and remove waste. the outer layers of cells of the cortex are the functional parts of the ovaries. the cortex is made up of follicular cells that surround eggs that develop during fetal development in utero. during the menstrual period, a batch of follicular cells develops and prepares the eggs for release. at ovulation, one follicle ruptures and one egg is released, as illustrated in [link]a. the oviducts, or fallopian tubes, extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries, but they are not in contact with the ovaries. the lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet-like structure and have a fringe of finger-like projections called fimbriae, illustrated in [link]b. when an egg is released at ovulation, the fimbrae help the non-motile egg enter into the tube and passage to the uterus. the walls of the oviducts are ciliated and are made up mostly of smooth muscle. the cilia beat toward the middle, and the smooth muscle contracts in the same direction, moving the egg toward the uterus. fertilization usually takes place within the oviducts and the developing embryo is moved toward the uterus for development. it usually takes the egg or embryo a week to travel through the oviduct. sterilization in women is called a tubal ligation; it is analogous to a vasectomy in males in that the oviducts are severed and sealed. the uterus is a structure about the size of a womans fist. this is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels and mucus glands. the uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus during gestation. the thickest portion of the wall of the uterus is made of smooth muscle. contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in passing the baby through the vagina during labor. a portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs off during each menstrual period, and then builds up again in preparation for an implantation. part of the uterus, called the cervix, protrudes into the top of the vagina. the cervix functions as the birth canal. the vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes. it allows menstrual flow to leave the body. it is the receptacle for the penis during intercourse and the vessel for the delivery of offspring. it is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells to protect the underlying tissue. the sexual response in humans is both psychological and physiological. both sexes experience sexual arousal through psychological and physical stimulation. there are four phases of the sexual response. during phase one, called excitement, vasodilation leads to vasocongestion in erectile tissues in both men and women. the nipples, clitoris, labia, and penis engorge with blood and become enlarged. vaginal secretions are released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse. during the second phase, called the plateau, stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood, and breathing and heart rate increase. during phase three, or orgasm, rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur in both sexes. in the male, the reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict placing semen in the urethra, then the urethra contracts expelling the semen through the penis. in women, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each. during phase four, or resolution, the processes described in the first three phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state. men experience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period of time ranging from minutes to hours. gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, takes place through the process of meiosis. during meiosis, two cell divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier stage of the cells life cycle. meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells. the production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis. spermatogenesis, illustrated in [link], occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules ([link]), with stem cells at the periphery of the tube and the spermatozoa at the lumen of the tube. immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid, undifferentiated cells. these stem cells, called spermatogonia (singular: spermatagonium), go through mitosis with one offspring going on to differentiate into a sperm cell and the other giving rise to the next generation of sperm. meiosis starts with a cell called a primary spermatocyte. at the end of the first meiotic division, a haploid cell is produced called a secondary spermatocyte. this cell is haploid and must go through another meiotic cell division. the cell produced at the end of meiosis is called a spermatid and when it reaches the lumen of the tubule and grows a flagellum, it is called a sperm cell. four sperm result from each primary spermatocyte that goes through meiosis. stem cells are deposited during gestation and are present at birth through the beginning of adolescence, but in an inactive state. during adolescence, gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary cause the activation of these cells and the production of viable sperm. this continues into old age. oogenesis, illustrated in [link], occurs in the outermost layers of the ovaries. as with sperm production, oogenesis starts with a germ cell, called an oogonium (plural: oogonia), but this cell undergoes mitosis to increase in number, eventually resulting in up to about one to two million cells in the embryo. the cell starting meiosis is called a primary oocyte, as shown in [link]. this cell will start the first meiotic division and be arrested in its progress in the first prophase stage. at the time of birth, all future eggs are in the prophase stage. at adolescence, anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a number of follicles in an ovary. this results in the primary oocyte finishing the first meiotic division. the cell divides unequally, with most of the cellular material and organelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm going to the other cell. this second cell is called a polar body and usually dies. a secondary meiotic arrest occurs, this time at the metaphase ii stage. at ovulation, this secondary oocyte will be released and travel toward the uterus through the oviduct. if the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through the meiosis ii, producing a second polar body and a fertilized egg containing all 46 chromosomes of a human being, half of them coming from the sperm. egg production begins before birth, is arrested during meiosis until puberty, and then individual cells continue through at each menstrual cycle. one egg is produced from each meiotic process, with the extra chromosomes and chromatids going into polar bodies that degenerate and are reabsorbed by the body. as animals became more complex, specific organs and organ systems developed to support specific functions for the organism. the reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally, and support the growth and development of offspring. processes developed to produce reproductive cells that had exactly half the number of chromosomes of each parent so that new combinations would have the appropriate amount of genetic material. gametogenesis, the production of sperm (spermatogenesis) and eggs (oogenesis), takes place through the process of meiosis.","[('clitori', 'clitorides', 'clitoris'), ('animal reproduction', 'animal reproductions'), ('labium majora', 'labium majoras'), ('vagina', 'vaginas'), ('sexual response', 'sexual responses'),

226,stax-bio,43,Animal Reproduction and Development,4,m44841,Hormonal Control of Human Reproduction,"the human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. in both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. when the reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) to the anterior pituitary. this causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) and luteinizing hormone (lh) from the anterior pituitary into the blood. note that the body must reach puberty in order for the adrenals to release the hormones that must be present for gnrh to be produced. although fsh and lh are named after their functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling reproduction. other hormones have specific functions in the male and female reproductive systems. at the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of fsh and lh into the male system for the first time. fsh enters the testes and stimulates the sertoli cells to begin facilitating spermatogenesis using negative feedback, as illustrated in [link]. lh also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of leydig to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood. testosterone, the hormone responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence, stimulates spermatogenesis. these secondary sex characteristics include a deepening of the voice, the growth of facial, axillary, and pubic hair, and the beginnings of the sex drive. a negative feedback system occurs in the male with rising levels of testosterone acting on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit the release of gnrh, fsh, and lh. the sertoli cells produce the hormone inhibin, which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high. this inhibits the release of gnrh and fsh, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down. if the sperm count reaches 20 million/ml, the sertoli cells cease the release of inhibin, and the sperm count increases. the control of reproduction in females is more complex. as with the male, the anterior pituitary hormones cause the release of the hormones fsh and lh. in addition, estrogens and progesterone are released from the developing follicles. estrogen is the reproductive hormone in females that assists in endometrial regrowth, ovulation, and calcium absorption; it is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females. these include breast development, flaring of the hips, and a shorter period necessary for bone maturation. progesterone assists in endometrial re-growth and inhibition of fsh and lh release. in females, fsh stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles. follicle cells produce the hormone inhibin, which inhibits fsh production. lh also plays a role in the development of ova, induction of ovulation, and stimulation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. estradiol and progesterone are steroid hormones that prepare the body for pregnancy. estradiol produces secondary sex characteristics in females, while both estradiol and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle. the ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while the menstrual cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining. these cycles occur concurrently and are coordinated over a 2232 day cycle, with an average length of 28 days. the first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase shown in [link]. slowly rising levels of fsh and lh cause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. this process prepares the egg for ovulation. as the follicles grow, they begin releasing estrogens and a low level of progesterone. progesterone maintains the endometrium to help ensure pregnancy. the trip through the fallopian tube takes about seven days. at this stage of development, called the morula, there are 30-60 cells. if pregnancy implantation does not occur, the lining is sloughed off. after about five days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual cycle enters the proliferative phase. the endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated during the end of the last cycle. just prior to the middle of the cycle (approximately day 14), the high level of estrogen causes fsh and especially lh to rise rapidly, then fall. the spike in lh causes ovulation: the most mature follicle, like that shown in [link], ruptures and releases its egg. the follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost. the level of estrogen decreases when the extra follicles degenerate. following ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase, illustrated in [link] and the menstrual cycle enters its secretory phase, both of which run from about day 15 to 28. the luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured follicle. the cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum. the corpus luteum produces estrogen and progesterone. the progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of further fsh and lh. the uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. the inhibition of fsh and lh prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated. the level of estrogen produced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days. if no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease. the endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle. the decrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send gnrh to the anterior pituitary, releasing fsh and lh and starting the cycles again. [link] visually compares the ovarian and uterine cycles as well as the commensurate hormone levels. as women approach their mid-40s to mid-50s, their ovaries begin to lose their sensitivity to fsh and lh. menstrual periods become less frequent and finally cease; this is menopause. there are still eggs and potential follicles on the ovaries, but without the stimulation of fsh and lh, they will not produce a viable egg to be released. the outcome of this is the inability to have children. the side effects of menopause include hot flashes, heavy sweating (especially at night), headaches, some hair loss, muscle pain, vaginal dryness, insomnia, depression, weight gain, and mood swings. estrogen is involved in calcium metabolism and, without it, blood levels of calcium decrease. to replenish the blood, calcium is lost from bone which may decrease the bone density and lead to osteoporosis. supplementation of estrogen in the form of hormone replacement therapy (hrt) can prevent bone loss, but the therapy can have negative side effects. while hrt is thought to give some protection from colon cancer, osteoporosis, heart disease, macular degeneration, and possibly depression, its negative side effects include increased risk of: stroke or heart attack, blood clots, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gall bladder disease, and possibly dementia. reproductive endocrinologist
a reproductive endocrinologist is a physician who treats a variety of hormonal disorders related to reproduction and infertility in both men and women. the disorders include menstrual problems, infertility, pregnancy loss, sexual dysfunction, and menopause. doctors may use fertility drugs, surgery, or assisted reproductive techniques (art) in their therapy. art involves the use of procedures to manipulate the egg or sperm to facilitate reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization. reproductive endocrinologists undergo extensive medical training, first in a four-year residency in obstetrics and gynecology, then in a three-year fellowship in reproductive endocrinology. to be board certified in this area, the physician must pass written and oral exams in both areas. the male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by hormones released from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary as well as hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. the hypothalamus monitors the need for the fsh and lh hormones made and released from the anterior pituitary. fsh and lh affect reproductive structures to cause the formation of sperm and the preparation of eggs for release and possible fertilization. in the male, fsh and lh stimulate sertoli cells and interstitial cells of leydig in the testes to facilitate sperm production. the leydig cells produce testosterone, which also is responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of males. in females, fsh and lh cause estrogen and progesterone to be produced. they regulate the female reproductive system which is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle. menopause occurs when the ovaries lose their sensitivity to fsh and lh and the female reproductive cycles slow to a stop.","[('progesterone', 'progesterones'), ('sertoli cell', 'sertoli cells'), ('gonadotropin-releasing hormone', 'gonadotropin-releasing hormones'), ('follicle stimulating hormone', 'follicle stimulating hormones', 'follicles stimulating hormone', 'follicles stimulating hormones'), ('testosterone', 'testosterones'), ('reproductive endocrinologist', 'reproductive endocrinologists'), ('interstitial cell of leydig', 'interstitial cell of leydigs', 'interstitial cells of leydig', 'interstitial cells of leydigs'), ('menopause', 'menopauses'), ('gnrh', 'gnrhs'), ('male hormone', 'male hormoness', 'male hormones'), ('estrogen', 'estrogens'), ('ovarian cycle', 'ovarian cycles'), ('luteinizing hormone', 'luteinizing hormones'), ('reproductive hormone', 'reproductive hormoness', 'reproductive hormones'), ('female hormone', 'female hormoness', 'female hormones'), ('animal development', 'animal developments'), ('lh', 'lhs'), ('inhibin', 'inhibins'), ('animal reproduction', 'animal reproductions'), ('ovulation', 'ovulations'), ('menstrual cycle', 'menstrual cycles'), ('fsh', 'fshes')]"
227,stax-bio,43,Animal Reproduction and Development,5,m44848,Human Pregnancy and Birth,"pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual. the length of time of gestation varies among animals, but is very similar among the great apes: human gestation is 266 days, while chimpanzee gestation is 237 days, a gorillas is 257 days, and orangutan gestation is 260 days long. the fox has a 57-day gestation. dogs and cats have similar gestations averaging 60 days. the longest gestation for a land mammal is an african elephant at 640 days. the longest gestations among marine mammals are the beluga and sperm whales at 460 days. twenty-four hours before fertilization, the egg has finished meiosis and becomes a mature oocyte. when fertilized (at conception) the egg becomes known as a zygote. the zygote travels through the oviduct to the uterus ([link]). the developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. the outer layers of the zygote (blastocyst) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue. another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin (-hcg) which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active. this ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo. pregnancy tests determine the level of -hcg in urine or serum. if the hormone is present, the test is positive. the gestation period is divided into three equal periods or trimesters. during the first two to four weeks of the first trimester, nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion. as the trimester progresses, the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium, and the placenta forms. this organ takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus, with the mothers blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it. chemicals from the fetus, such as bilirubin, are processed by the mothers liver for elimination. some of the mothers immunoglobulins will pass through the placenta, providing passive immunity against some potential infections. internal organs and body structures begin to develop during the first trimester. by five weeks, limb buds, eyes, the heart, and liver have been basically formed. by eight weeks, the term fetus applies, and the body is essentially formed, as shown in [link]. the individual is about five centimeters (two inches) in length and many of the organs, such as the lungs and liver, are not yet functioning. exposure to any toxins is especially dangerous during the first trimester, as all of the bodys organs and structures are going through initial development. anything that affects that development can have a severe effect on the fetus survival. during the second trimester, the fetus grows to about 30 cm (12 inches), as shown in [link]. it becomes active and the mother usually feels the first movements. all organs and structures continue to develop. the placenta has taken over the functions of nutrition and waste and the production of estrogen and progesterone from the corpus luteum, which has degenerated. the placenta will continue functioning up through the delivery of the baby. during the third trimester, the fetus grows to 3 to 4 kg (6  -8  lbs.) and about 50 cm (19-20 inches) long, as illustrated in [link]. this is the period of the most rapid growth during the pregnancy. organ development continues to birth (and some systems, such as the nervous system and liver, continue to develop after birth). the mother will be at her most uncomfortable during this trimester. she may urinate frequently due to pressure on the bladder from the fetus. there may also be intestinal blockage and circulatory problems, especially in her legs. clots may form in her legs due to pressure from the fetus on returning veins as they enter the abdominal cavity. labor is the physical efforts of expulsion of the fetus and the placenta from the uterus during birth (parturition). toward the end of the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone oxytocin. at this time, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening). this causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals for the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. the oxytocin causes the smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. at the same time, the placenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. a positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. as more smooth muscle cells are recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force. there are three stages to labor. during stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. this is necessary for the baby and placenta to be expelled during birth. the cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. during stage two, the baby is expelled from the uterus. the uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. the last stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall. if labor should stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin, known as pitocin, can be administered to restart and maintain labor. an alternative to labor and delivery is the surgical delivery of the baby through a procedure called a caesarian section. this is major abdominal surgery and can lead to post-surgical complications for the mother, but in some cases it may be the only way to safely deliver the baby. the mothers mammary glands go through changes during the third trimester to prepare for lactation and breastfeeding. when the baby begins suckling at the breast, signals are sent to the hypothalamus causing the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary. prolactin causes the mammary glands to produce milk. oxytocin is also released, promoting the release of the milk. the milk contains nutrients for the babys development and growth as well as immunoglobulins to protect the child from bacterial and viral infections. the prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control. strictly speaking, contraception refers to preventing the sperm and egg from joining. both terms are, however, frequently used interchangeably. [link] lists common methods of contraception. the failure rates listed are not the ideal rates that could be realized, but the typical rates that occur. a failure rate is the number of pregnancies resulting from the methods use over a twelve-month period. barrier methods, such as condoms, cervical caps, and diaphragms, block sperm from entering the uterus, preventing fertilization. spermicides are chemicals that are placed in the vagina that kill sperm. sponges, which are saturated with spermicides, are placed in the vagina at the cervical opening. combinations of spermicidal chemicals and barrier methods achieve lower failure rates than do the methods when used separately. nearly a quarter of the couples using barrier methods, natural family planning, or withdrawal can expect a failure of the method. natural family planning is based on the monitoring of the menstrual cycle and having intercourse only during times when the egg is not available. a womans body temperature may rise a degree celsius at ovulation and the cervical mucus may increase in volume and become more pliable. these changes give a general indication of when intercourse is more or less likely to result in fertilization. withdrawal involves the removal of the penis from the vagina during intercourse, before ejaculation occurs. this is a risky method with a high failure rate due to the possible presence of sperm in the bulbourethral glands secretion, which may enter the vagina prior to removing the penis. hormonal methods use synthetic progesterone (sometimes in combination with estrogen), to inhibit the hypothalamus from releasing fsh or lh, and thus prevent an egg from being available for fertilization. the method of administering the hormone affects failure rate. the most reliable method, with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, is the implantation of the hormone under the skin. the same rate can be achieved through the sterilization procedures of vasectomy in the man or of tubal ligation in the woman, or by using an intrauterine device (iud). iuds are inserted into the uterus and establish an inflammatory condition that prevents fertilized eggs from implanting into the uterine wall. compliance with the contraceptive method is a strong contributor to the success or failure rate of any particular method. the only method that is completely effective at preventing conception is abstinence. the choice of contraceptive method depends on the goals of the woman or couple. tubal ligation and vasectomy are considered permanent prevention, while other methods are reversible and provide short-term contraception. termination of an existing pregnancy can be spontaneous or voluntary. spontaneous termination is a miscarriage and usually occurs very early in the pregnancy, usually within the first few weeks. this occurs when the fetus cannot develop properly and the gestation is naturally terminated. voluntary termination of a pregnancy is an abortion. laws regulating abortion vary between states and tend to view fetal viability as the criteria for allowing or preventing the procedure. infertility is the inability to conceive a child or carry a child to birth. about 75 percent of causes of infertility can be identified; these include diseases, such as sexually transmitted diseases that can cause scarring of the reproductive tubes in either men or women, or developmental problems frequently related to abnormal hormone levels in one of the individuals. inadequate nutrition, especially starvation, can delay menstruation. stress can also lead to infertility. short-term stress can affect hormone levels, while long-term stress can delay puberty and cause less frequent menstrual cycles. other factors that affect fertility include toxins (such as cadmium), tobacco smoking, marijuana use, gonadal injuries, and aging. if infertility is identified, several assisted reproductive technologies (art) are available to aid conception. a common type of art is in vitro fertilization (ivf) where an egg and sperm are combined outside the body and then placed in the uterus. eggs are obtained from the woman after extensive hormonal treatments that prepare mature eggs for fertilization and prepare the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg. sperm are obtained from the man and they are combined with the eggs and supported through several cell divisions to ensure viability of the zygotes. when the embryos have reached the eight-cell stage, one or more is implanted into the womans uterus. if fertilization is not accomplished by simple ivf, a procedure that injects the sperm into an egg can be used. this is called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi) and is shown in [link]. ivf procedures produce a surplus of fertilized eggs and embryos that can be frozen and stored for future use. the procedures can also result in multiple births. human pregnancy begins with fertilization of an egg and proceeds through the three trimesters of gestation. the labor process has three stages (contractions, delivery of the fetus, expulsion of the placenta), each propelled by hormones. the first trimester lays down the basic structures of the body, including the limb buds, heart, eyes, and the liver. the second trimester continues the development of all of the organs and systems. the third trimester exhibits the greatest growth of the fetus and culminates in labor and delivery. prevention of a pregnancy can be accomplished through a variety of methods including barriers, hormones, or other means. assisted reproductive technologies may help individuals who have infertility problems.","[('human birth', 'human births'), ('infertility', 'infertilities'), ('human betum chorionic gonadotropin', 'human betum chorionic gonadotropins', 'human betum chorionics gonadotropin', 'human betum chorionics gonadotropins', 'human betums chorionic gonadotropin', 'human betums chorionic gonadotropins', 'human betums chorionics gonadotropin', 'human betums chorionics gonadotropins'), ('pregnancy', 'pregnancies'), ('contraception', 'contraceptions'), ('animal reproduction', 'animal reproductions'), ('placentum', 'placentas', 'placenta'), ('fetal development', 'fetal developments'), ('labor', 'labors'), ('birth control', 'birth controls'), ('birth', 'births'), ('delivery', 'deliveries'), ('morning sicknes', 'morning sicknesses', 'morning sickness'), ('human pregnancy', 'human pregnancies'), ('trimester', 'trimesters'), ('gestation', 'gestations'), ('animal development', 'animal developments')]"
228,stax-bio,43,Animal Reproduction and Development,6,m44846,Fertilization and Early Embryonic Development,"the process in which an organism develops from a single-celled zygote to a multi-cellular organism is complex and well-regulated. the early stages of embryonic development are also crucial for ensuring the fitness of the organism. fertilization, pictured in [link]a is the process in which gametes (an egg and sperm) fuse to form a zygote. the egg and sperm each contain one set of chromosomes. to ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes, only one sperm must fuse with one egg. in mammals, the egg is protected by a layer of extracellular matrix consisting mainly of glycoproteins called the zona pellucida. when a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a series of biochemical events, called the acrosomal reactions, take place. in placental mammals, the acrosome contains digestive enzymes that initiate the degradation of the glycoprotein matrix protecting the egg and allowing the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane, as illustrated in [link]b. the fusion of these two membranes creates an opening through which the sperm nucleus is transferred into the ovum. the nuclear membranes of the egg and sperm break down and the two haploid genomes condense to form a diploid genome. to ensure that no more than one sperm fertilizes the egg, once the acrosomal reactions take place at one location of the egg membrane, the egg releases proteins in other locations to prevent other sperm from fusing with the egg. if this mechanism fails, multiple sperm can fuse with the egg, resulting in polyspermy. the resulting embryo is not genetically viable and dies within a few days. the development of multi-cellular organisms begins from a single-celled zygote, which undergoes rapid cell division to form the blastula. the rapid, multiple rounds of cell division are termed cleavage. cleavage is illustrated in ([link]a). after the cleavage has produced over 100 cells, the embryo is called a blastula. the blastula is usually a spherical layer of cells (the blastoderm) surrounding a fluid-filled or yolk-filled cavity (the blastocoel). mammals at this stage form a structure called the blastocyst, characterized by an inner cell mass that is distinct from the surrounding blastula, shown in [link]b. during cleavage, the cells divide without an increase in mass; that is, one large single-celled zygote divides into multiple smaller cells. each cell within the blastula is called a blastomere. cleavage can take place in two ways: holoblastic (total) cleavage or meroblastic (partial) cleavage. the type of cleavage depends on the amount of yolk in the eggs. in placental mammals (including humans) where nourishment is provided by the mothers body, the eggs have a very small amount of yolk and undergo holoblastic cleavage. other species, such as birds, with a lot of yolk in the egg to nourish the embryo during development, undergo meroblastic cleavage. in mammals, the blastula forms the blastocyst in the next stage of development. here the cells in the blastula arrange themselves in two layers: the inner cell mass, and an outer layer called the trophoblast. the inner cell mass is also known as the embryoblast and this mass of cells will go on to form the embryo. at this stage of development, illustrated in [link] the inner cell mass consists of embryonic stem cells that will differentiate into the different cell types needed by the organism. the trophoblast will contribute to the placenta and nourish the embryo. the typical blastula is a ball of cells. the next stage in embryonic development is the formation of the body plan. the cells in the blastula rearrange themselves spatially to form three layers of cells. this process is called gastrulation. during gastrulation, the blastula folds upon itself to form the three layers of cells. each of these layers is called a germ layer and each germ layer differentiates into different organ systems. the three germs layers, shown in [link], are the endoderm, the ectoderm, and the mesoderm. the ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermis. the mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body. the endoderm gives rise to columnar cells found in the digestive system and many internal organs. are designer babies in our future?
this logo from the second international eugenics conference in new york city in september of 1921 shows how eugenics attempted to merge several fields of study with the goal of producing a genetically superior human race.


 if you could prevent your child from getting a devastating genetic disease, would you do it? would you select the sex of your child or select for their attractiveness, strength, or intelligence? how far would you go to maximize the possibility of resistance to disease? the genetic engineering of a human child, the production of ""designer babies"" with desirable phenotypic characteristics, was once a topic restricted to science fiction. this is the case no longer: science fiction is now overlapping into science fact. many phenotypic choices for offspring are already available, with many more likely to be possible in the not too distant future. which traits should be selected and how they should be selected are topics of much debate within the worldwide medical community. the ethical and moral line is not always clear or agreed upon, and some fear that modern reproductive technologies could lead to a new form of eugenics. eugenics is the use of information and technology from a variety of sources to improve the genetic makeup of the human race. the goal of creating genetically superior humans was quite prevalent (although controversial) in several countries during the early 20th century, but fell into disrepute when nazi germany developed an extensive eugenics program in the 1930's and 40's. as part of their program, the nazis forcibly sterilized hundreds of thousands of the so-called ""unfit"" and killed tens of thousands of institutionally disabled people as part of a systematic program to develop a genetically superior race of germans known as aryans. ever since, eugenic ideas have not been as publicly expressed, but there are still those who promote them. efforts have been made in the past to control traits in human children using donated sperm from men with desired traits. in fact, eugenicist robert klark graham established a sperm bank in 1980 that included samples exclusively from donors with high iqs. the ""genius"" sperm bank failed to capture the public's imagination and the operation closed in 1999. in more recent times, the procedure known as prenatal genetic diagnosis (pgd) has been developed. pgd involves the screening of human embryos as part of the process of in vitro fertilization, during which embryos are conceived and grown outside the mother's body for some period of time before they are implanted. the term pgd usually refers to both the diagnosis, selection, and the implantation of the selected embryos. in the least controversial use of pgd, embryos are tested for the presence of alleles which cause genetic diseases such as sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and hemophilia, in which a single disease-causing allele or pair of alleles has been identified. by excluding embryos containing these alleles from implantation into the mother, the disease is prevented, and the unused embryos are either donated to science or discarded. there are relatively few in the worldwide medical community that question the ethics of this type of procedure, which allows individuals scared to have children because of the alleles they carry to do so successfully. the major limitation to this procedure is its expense. not usually covered by medical insurance and thus out of reach financially for most couples, only a very small percentage of all live births use such complicated methodologies. yet, even in cases like these where the ethical issues may seem to be clear-cut, not everyone agrees with the morality of these types of procedures. for example, to those who take the position that human life begins at conception, the discarding of unused embryos, a necessary result of pgd, is unacceptable under any circumstances. a murkier ethical situation is found in the selection of a child's sex, which is easily performed by pgd. currently, countries such as great britain have banned the selection of a child's sex for reasons other than preventing sex-linked diseases. other countries allow the procedure for ""family balancing"", based on the desire of some parents to have at least one child of each sex. still others, including the united states, have taken a scattershot approach to regulating these practices, essentially leaving it to the individual practicing physician to decide which practices are acceptable and which are not. even murkier are rare instances of disabled parents, such as those with deafness or dwarfism, who select embryos via pgd to ensure that they share their disability. these parents usually cite many positive aspects of their disabilities and associated culture as reasons for their choice, which they see as their moral right. to others, to purposely cause a disability in a child violates the basic medical principle of primum non nocere, ""first, do no harm."" this procedure, although not illegal in most countries, demonstrates the complexity of ethical issues associated with choosing genetic traits in offspring. where could this process lead? will this technology become more affordable and how should it be used? with the ability of technology to progress rapidly and unpredictably, a lack of definitive guidelines for the use of reproductive technologies before they arise might make it difficult for legislators to keep pace once they are in fact realized, assuming the process needs any government regulation at all. other bioethicists argue that we should only deal with technologies that exist now, and not in some uncertain future. they argue that these types of procedures will always be expensive and rare, so the fears of eugenics and ""master"" races are unfounded and overstated. the debate continues. the early stages of embryonic development begin with fertilization. the process of fertilization is tightly controlled to ensure that only one sperm fuses with one egg. after fertilization, the zygote undergoes cleavage to form the blastula. the blastula, which in some species is a hollow ball of cells, undergoes a process called gastrulation, in which the three germ layers form. the ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermal skin cells, the mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body, and the endoderm gives rise to columnar cells and internal organs.","[('fertilization', 'fertilizations'), ('zygote', 'zygotes'), ('holoblastic', 'holoblastics'), ('embryo', 'embryos'), ('acrosomal reaction', 'acrosomal reactions'), ('inner cell mas', 'inner cell masses', 'inner cell mass', 'inner cells mas', 'inner cells masses', 'inner cells mass'), ('trophoblast', 'trophoblasts'), ('animal reproduction', 'animal reproductions'), ('blastula', 'blastulas'), ('blastocyst', 'blastocysts'), ('animal development', 'animal developments'), ('meroblastic', 'meroblastics'), ('zona pellucida', 'zona pellucidas'), ('embryonic development', 'embryonic developments'), ('polyspermy', 'polyspermies'), ('germ layer', 'germ layerss', 'germ layers'), ('cleavage', 'cleavages'), ('gastrulation', 'gastrulations')]"
229,stax-bio,43,Animal Reproduction and Development,7,m44850,Organogenesis and Vertebrate Formation,"gastrulation leads to the formation of the three germ layers that give rise, during further development, to the different organs in the animal body. this process is called organogenesis. organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements of the cells within the embryo. organs form from the germ layers through the process of differentiation. during differentiation, the embryonic stem cells express specific sets of genes which will determine their ultimate cell type. for example, some cells in the ectoderm will express the genes specific to skin cells. as a result, these cells will differentiate into epidermal cells. the process of differentiation is regulated by cellular signaling cascades. scientists study organogenesis extensively in the lab in fruit flies (drosophila) and the nematode caenorhabditis elegans. drosophila have segments along their bodies, and the patterning associated with the segment formation has allowed scientists to study which genes play important roles in organogenesis along the length of the embryo at different time points. the nematode c.elegans has roughly 1000 somatic cells and scientists have studied the fate of each of these cells during their development in the nematode life cycle. there is little variation in patterns of cell lineage between individuals, unlike in mammals where cell development from the embryo is dependent on cellular cues. in vertebrates, one of the primary steps during organogenesis is the formation of the neural system. the ectoderm forms epithelial cells and tissues, and neuronal tissues. during the formation of the neural system, special signaling molecules called growth factors signal some cells at the edge of the ectoderm to become epidermis cells. the remaining cells in the center form the neural plate. if the signaling by growth factors were disrupted, then the entire ectoderm would differentiate into neural tissue. the neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube, as illustrated in [link]. in further development, the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord. the mesoderm that lies on either side of the vertebrate neural tube will develop into the various connective tissues of the animal body. a spatial pattern of gene expression reorganizes the mesoderm into groups of cells called somites with spaces between them. the somites, illustrated in [link] will further develop into the ribs, lungs, and segmental (spine) muscle. the mesoderm also forms a structure called the notochord, which is rod-shaped and forms the central axis of the animal body. even as the germ layers form, the ball of cells still retains its spherical shape. however, animal bodies have lateral-medial (left-right), dorsal-ventral (back-belly), and anterior-posterior (head-feet) axes, illustrated in [link]. how are these established? in one of the most seminal experiments ever to be carried out in developmental biology, spemann and mangold took dorsal cells from one embryo and transplanted them into the belly region of another embryo. they found that the transplanted embryo now had two notochords: one at the dorsal site from the original cells and another at the transplanted site. this suggested that the dorsal cells were genetically programmed to form the notochord and define the axis. since then, researchers have identified many genes that are responsible for axis formation. mutations in these genes leads to the loss of symmetry required for organism development. animal bodies have externally visible symmetry. however, the internal organs are not symmetric. for example, the heart is on the left side and the liver on the right. the formation of the central left-right axis is an important process during development. this internal asymmetry is established very early during development and involves many genes. research is still ongoing to fully understand the developmental implications of these genes. organogenesis is the formation of organs from the germ layers. each germ layer gives rise to specific tissue types. the first stage is the formation of the neural system in the ectoderm. the mesoderm gives rise to somites and the notochord. formation of vertebrate axis is another important developmental stage.","[('organogenesi', 'organogeneses', 'organogenesis'), ('animal reproduction', 'animal reproductions'), ('somite', 'somites'), ('vertebrate formation', 'vertebrate formations'), ('neural tube', 'neural tubes'), ('animal development', 'animal developments')]"

health is one important part of human interaction with our physical and living environment. lyme disease, for instance, serves as one modern-day example of the connection between our health and the natural world ([link]). more formally known as lyme borreliosis, lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans when they are bitten by the deer tick (ixodes scapularis), which is the primary vector for this disease. however, not all deer ticks carry the bacteria that will cause lyme disease in humans, and i. scapularis can have other hosts besides deer. in fact, it turns out that the probability of infection depends on the type of host upon which the tick develops: a higher proportion of ticks that live on white-footed mice carry the bacterium than do ticks that live on deer. knowledge about the environments and population densities in which the host species is abundant would help a physician or an epidemiologist better understand how lyme disease is transmitted and how its incidence could be reduced.","[('permafrost', 'permafrosts'), ('ecologist', 'ecologists'), ('atmospheric carbon dioxide', 'atmospheric carbon dioxides', 'atmospheric carbons

231,stax-bio,44,Ecology and the Biosphere,1,m44856,The Scope of Ecology,"ecology is the study of the interactions of living organisms with their environment. one core goal of ecology is to understand the distribution and abundance of living things in the physical environment. attainment of this goal requires the integration of scientific disciplines inside and outside of biology, such as biochemistry, physiology, evolution, biodiversity, molecular biology, geology, and climatology. some ecological research also applies aspects of chemistry and physics, and it frequently uses mathematical models. when a discipline such as biology is studied, it is often helpful to subdivide it into smaller, related areas. for instance, cell biologists interested in cell signaling need to understand the chemistry of the signal molecules (which are usually proteins) as well as the result of cell signaling. ecologists interested in the factors that influence the survival of an endangered species might use mathematical models to predict how current conservation efforts affect endangered organisms. to produce a sound set of management options, a conservation biologist needs to collect accurate data, including current population size, factors affecting reproduction (like physiology and behavior), habitat requirements (such as plants and soils), and potential human influences on the endangered population and its habitat (which might be derived through studies in sociology and urban ecology). within the discipline of ecology, researchers work at four specific levels, sometimes discretely and sometimes with overlap: organism, population, community, and ecosystem ([link]). researchers studying ecology at the organismal level are interested in the adaptations that enable individuals to live in specific habitats. these adaptations can be morphological, physiological, and behavioral. for instance, the karner blue butterfly (lycaeides melissa samuelis) ([link]) is considered a specialist because the females preferentially oviposit (that is, lay eggs) on wild lupine. this preferential adaptation means that the karner blue butterfly is highly dependent on the presence of wild lupine plants for its continued survival. after hatching, the larval caterpillars emerge and spend four to six weeks feeding solely on wild lupine ([link]). the caterpillars pupate (undergo metamorphosis) and emerge as butterflies after about four weeks. the adult butterflies feed on the nectar of flowers of wild lupine and other plant species. a researcher interested in studying karner blue butterflies at the organismal level might, in addition to asking questions about egg laying, ask questions about the butterflies preferred temperature (a physiological question) or the behavior of the caterpillars when they are at different larval stages (a behavioral question). a population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members of the same species living in the same area at the same time. (organisms that are all members of the same species are called conspecifics.) a population is identified, in part, by where it lives, and its area of population may have natural or artificial boundaries: natural boundaries might be rivers, mountains, or deserts, while examples of artificial boundaries include mowed grass, manmade structures, or roads. the study of population ecology focuses on the number of individuals in an area and how and why population size changes over time. population ecologists are particularly interested in counting the karner blue butterfly, for example, because it is classified as federally endangered. however, the distribution and density of this species is highly influenced by the distribution and abundance of wild lupine. researchers might ask questions about the factors leading to the decline of wild lupine and how these affect karner blue butterflies. for example, ecologists know that wild lupine thrives in open areas where trees and shrubs are largely absent. in natural settings, intermittent wildfires regularly remove trees and shrubs, helping to maintain the open areas that wild lupine requires. mathematical models can be used to understand how wildfire suppression by humans has led to the decline of this important plant for the karner blue butterfly. a biological community consists of the different species within an area, typically a three-dimensional space, and the interactions within and among these species. community ecologists are interested in the processes driving these interactions and their consequences. questions about conspecific interactions often focus on competition among members of the same species for a limited resource. ecologists also study interactions among various species; members of different species are called heterospecifics. examples of heterospecific interactions include predation, parasitism, herbivory, competition, and pollination. these interactions can have regulating effects on population sizes and can impact ecological and evolutionary processes affecting diversity. for example, karner blue butterfly larvae form mutualistic relationships with ants. mutualism is a form of a long-term relationship that has coevolved between two species and from which each species benefits. for mutualism to exist between individual organisms, each species must receive some benefit from the other as a consequence of the relationship. researchers have shown that there is an increase in the probability of survival when karner blue butterfly larvae (caterpillars) are tended by ants. this might be because the larvae spend less time in each life stage when tended by ants, which provides an advantage for the larvae. meanwhile, the karner blue butterfly larvae secrete a carbohydrate-rich substance that is an important energy source for the ants. both the karner blue larvae and the ants benefit from their interaction. ecosystem ecology is an extension of organismal, population, and community ecology. the ecosystem is composed of all the biotic components (living things) in an area along with the abiotic components (non-living things) of that area. some of the abiotic components include air, water, and soil. ecosystem biologists ask questions about how nutrients and energy are stored and how they move among organisms and the surrounding atmosphere, soil, and water. the karner blue butterflies and the wild lupine live in an oak-pine barren habitat. this habitat is characterized by natural disturbance and nutrient-poor soils that are low in nitrogen. the availability of nutrients is an important factor in the distribution of the plants that live in this habitat. researchers interested in ecosystem ecology could ask questions about the importance of limited resources and the movement of resources, such as nutrients, though the biotic and abiotic portions of the ecosystem. 
a career in ecology contributes to many facets of human society. understanding ecological issues can help society meet the basic human needs of food, shelter, and health care. ecologists can conduct their research in the laboratory and outside in natural environments ([link]). these natural environments can be as close to home as the stream running through your campus or as far away as the hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the pacific ocean. ecologists manage natural resources such as white-tailed deer populations (odocoileus virginianus) for hunting or aspen (populus spp.) timber stands for paper production. ecologists also work as educators who teach children and adults at various institutions including universities, high schools, museums, and nature centers. ecologists may also work in advisory positions assisting local, state, and federal policymakers to develop laws that are ecologically sound, or they may develop those policies and legislation themselves. to become an ecologist requires an undergraduate degree, usually in a natural science. the undergraduate degree is often followed by specialized training or an advanced degree, depending on the area of ecology selected. ecologists should also have a broad background in the physical sciences, as well as a sound foundation in mathematics and statistics. ecology is the study of the interactions of living things with their environment. ecologists ask questions across four levels of biological organizationorganismal, population, community, and ecosystem. at the organismal level, ecologists study individual organisms and how they interact with their environments. at the population and community levels, ecologists explore, respectively, how a population of organisms changes over time and the ways in which that population interacts with other species in the community. ecologists studying an ecosystem examine the living species (the biotic components) of the ecosystem as well as the nonliving portions (the abiotic components), such as air, water, and soil, of the environment.","[('heterospecific', 'heterospecifics'), ('organismal ecology', 'organismal ecologies'), ('interdisciplinary ecology', 'interdisciplinary ecologies'), ('ecologist', 'ecologists'), ('ecosystem ecology', 'ecosystem ecologies'), ('abiotic', 'abiotics'), ('ecological research', 'ecological research'), ('ecosystem', 'ecosystems'), ('ecology study', 'ecology studies'), ('biosphere', 'biospheres'), ('biotic', 'biotics'), ('mutualism', 'mutualisms'), ('ecological study', 'ecological studies'), ('conspecific', 'conspecifics'), ('ecology', 'ecologies'), ('community ecology', 'community ecologies'), ('population ecology', 'population ecologies')]"
232,stax-bio,44,Ecology and the Biosphere,2,m44857,Biogeography,"many forces influence the communities of living organisms present in different parts of the biosphere (all of the parts of earth inhabited by life). the biosphere extends into the atmosphere (several kilometers above earth) and into the depths of the oceans. despite its apparent vastness to an individual human, the biosphere occupies only a minute space when compared to the known universe. many abiotic forces influence where life can exist and the types of organisms found in different parts of the biosphere. the abiotic factors influence the distribution of biomes: large areas of land with similar climate, flora, and fauna. biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution. abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall vary based mainly on latitude and elevation. as these abiotic factors change, the composition of plant and animal communities also changes. for example, if you were to begin a journey at the equator and walk north, you would notice gradual changes in plant communities. at the beginning of your journey, you would see tropical wet forests with broad-leaved evergreen trees, which are characteristic of plant communities found near the equator. as you continued to travel north, you would see these broad-leaved evergreen plants eventually give rise to seasonally dry forests with scattered trees. you would also begin to notice changes in temperature and moisture. at about 30 degrees north, these forests would give way to deserts, which are characterized by low precipitation. moving farther north, you would see that deserts are replaced by grasslands or prairies. eventually, grasslands are replaced by deciduous temperate forests. these deciduous forests give way to the boreal forests found in the subarctic, the area south of the arctic circle. finally, you would reach the arctic tundra, which is found at the most northern latitudes. this trek north reveals gradual changes in both climate and the types of organisms that have adapted to environmental factors associated with ecosystems found at different latitudes. however, different ecosystems exist at the same latitude due in part to abiotic factors such as jet streams, the gulf stream, and ocean currents. if you were to hike up a mountain, the changes you would see in the vegetation would parallel those as you move to higher latitudes. ecologists who study biogeography examine patterns of species distribution. no species exists everywhere; for example, the venus flytrap is endemic to a small area in north and south carolina. an endemic species is one which is naturally found only in a specific geographic area that is usually restricted in size. other species are generalists: species which live in a wide variety of geographic areas; the raccoon, for example, is native to most of north and central america. species distribution patterns are based on biotic and abiotic factors and their influences during the very long periods of time required for species evolution; therefore, early studies of biogeography were closely linked to the emergence of evolutionary thinking in the eighteenth century. some of the most distinctive assemblages of plants and animals occur in regions that have been physically separated for millions of years by geographic barriers. biologists estimate that australia, for example, has between 600,000 and 700,000 species of plants and animals. approximately 3/4 of living plant and mammal species are endemic species found solely in australia ([link]ab). sometimes ecologists discover unique patterns of species distribution by determining where species are not found. hawaii, for example, has no native land species of reptiles or amphibians, and has only one native terrestrial mammal, the hoary bat. most of new guinea, as another example, lacks placental mammals. plants can be endemic or generalists: endemic plants are found only on specific regions of the earth, while generalists are found on many regions. isolated land massessuch as australia, hawaii, and madagascaroften have large numbers of endemic plant species. some of these plants are endangered due to human activity. the forest gardenia (gardenia brighamii), for instance, is endemic to hawaii; only an estimated 1520 trees are thought to exist ([link]). energy from the sun is captured by green plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and photosynthetic protists. these organisms convert solar energy into the chemical energy needed by all living things. light availability can be an important force directly affecting the evolution of adaptations in photosynthesizers. for instance, plants in the understory of a temperate forest are shaded when the trees above them in the canopy completely leaf out in the late spring. not surprisingly, understory plants have adaptations to successfully capture available light. one such adaptation is the rapid growth of spring ephemeral plants such as the spring beauty ([link]). these spring flowers achieve much of their growth and finish their life cycle (reproduce) early in the season before the trees in the canopy develop leaves. in aquatic ecosystems, the availability of light may be limited because sunlight is absorbed by water, plants, suspended particles, and resident microorganisms. toward the bottom of a lake, pond, or ocean, there is a zone that light cannot reach. photosynthesis cannot take place there and, as a result, a number of adaptations have evolved that enable living things to survive without light. for instance, aquatic plants have photosynthetic tissue near the surface of the water; for example, think of the broad, floating leaves of a water lilywater lilies cannot survive without light. in environments such as hydrothermal vents, some bacteria extract energy from inorganic chemicals because there is no light for photosynthesis. the availability of nutrients in aquatic systems is also an important aspect of energy or photosynthesis. many organisms sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die in the open water; when this occurs, the energy found in that living organism is sequestered for some time unless ocean upwelling occurs. ocean upwelling is the rising of deep ocean waters that occurs when prevailing winds blow along surface waters near a coastline ([link]). as the wind pushes ocean waters offshore, water from the bottom of the ocean moves up to replace this water. as a result, the nutrients once contained in dead organisms become available for reuse by other living organisms. in freshwater systems, the recycling of nutrients occurs in response to air temperature changes. the nutrients at the bottom of lakes are recycled twice each year: in the spring and fall turnover. the spring and fall turnover is a seasonal process that recycles nutrients and oxygen from the bottom of a freshwater ecosystem to the top of a body of water ([link]). these turnovers are caused by the formation of a thermocline: a layer of water with a temperature that is significantly different from that of the surrounding layers. in wintertime, the surface of lakes found in many northern regions is frozen. however, the water under the ice is slightly warmer, and the water at the bottom of the lake is warmer yet at 4 c to 5 c (39.2 f to 41 f). water is densest at 4 c; therefore, the deepest water is also the densest. the deepest water is oxygen poor because the decomposition of organic material at the bottom of the lake uses up available oxygen that cannot be replaced by means of oxygen diffusion into the water due to the surface ice layer. in springtime, air temperatures increase and surface ice melts. when the temperature of the surface water begins to reach 4 c, the water becomes heavier and sinks to the bottom. the water at the bottom of the lake is then displaced by the heavier surface water and, thus, rises to the top. as that water rises to the top, the sediments and nutrients from the lake bottom are brought along with it. during the summer months, the lake water stratifies, or forms layers, with the warmest water at the lake surface. as air temperatures drop in the fall, the temperature of the lake water cools to 4 c; therefore, this causes fall turnover as the heavy cold water sinks and displaces the water at the bottom. the oxygen-rich water at the surface of the lake then moves to the bottom of the lake, while the nutrients at the bottom of the lake rise to the surface ([link]). during the winter, the oxygen at the bottom of the lake is used by decomposers and other organisms requiring oxygen, such as fish. temperature affects the physiology of living things as well as the density and state of water. temperature exerts an important influence on living things because few living things can survive at temperatures below 0 c (32 f) due to metabolic constraints. it is also rare for living things to survive at temperatures exceeding 45 c (113 f); this is a reflection of evolutionary response to typical temperatures. enzymes are most efficient within a narrow and specific range of temperatures; enzyme degradation can occur at higher temperatures. therefore, organisms either must maintain an internal temperature or they must inhabit an environment that will keep the body within a temperature range that supports metabolism. some animals have adapted to enable their bodies to survive significant temperature fluctuations, such as seen in hibernation or reptilian torpor. similarly, some bacteria are adapted to surviving in extremely hot temperatures such as geysers. such bacteria are examples of extremophiles: organisms that thrive in extreme environments. temperature can limit the distribution of living things. animals faced with temperature fluctuations may respond with adaptations, such as migration, in order to survive. migration, the movement from one place to another, is an adaptation found in many animals, including many that inhabit seasonally cold climates. migration solves problems related to temperature, locating food, and finding a mate. in migration, for instance, the arctic tern (sterna paradisaea) makes a 40,000 km (24,000 mi) round trip flight each year between its feeding grounds in the southern hemisphere and its breeding grounds in the arctic ocean. monarch butterflies (danaus plexippus) live in the eastern united states in the warmer months and migrate to mexico and the southern united states in the wintertime. some species of mammals also make migratory forays. reindeer (rangifer tarandus) travel about 5,000 km (3,100 mi) each year to find food. amphibians and reptiles are more limited in their distribution because they lack migratory ability. not all animals that can migrate do so: migration carries risk and comes at a high energy cost. some animals hibernate or estivate to survive hostile temperatures. hibernation enables animals to survive cold conditions, and estivation allows animals to survive the hostile conditions of a hot, dry climate. animals that hibernate or estivate enter a state known as torpor: a condition in which their metabolic rate is significantly lowered. this enables the animal to wait until its environment better supports its survival. some amphibians, such as the wood frog (rana sylvatica), have an antifreeze-like chemical in their cells, which retains the cells integrity and prevents them from bursting. water is required by all living things because it is critical for cellular processes. since terrestrial organisms lose water to the environment by simple diffusion, they have evolved many adaptations to retain water. inorganic nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are important in the distribution and the abundance of living things. plants obtain these inorganic nutrients from the soil when water moves into the plant through the roots. therefore, soil structure (particle size of soil components), soil ph, and soil nutrient content play an important role in the distribution of plants. animals obtain inorganic nutrients from the food they consume. therefore, animal distributions are related to the distribution of what they eat. in some cases, animals will follow their food resource as it moves through the environment. some abiotic factors, such as oxygen, are important in aquatic ecosystems as well as terrestrial environments. terrestrial animals obtain oxygen from the air they breathe. oxygen availability can be an issue for organisms living at very high elevations, however, where there are fewer molecules of oxygen in the air. in aquatic systems, the concentration of dissolved oxygen is related to water temperature and the speed at which the water moves. cold water has more dissolved oxygen than warmer water. in addition, salinity, current, and tide can be important abiotic factors in aquatic ecosystems. wind can be an important abiotic factor because it influences the rate of evaporation and transpiration. the physical force of wind is also important because it can move soil, water, or other abiotic factors, as well as an ecosystems organisms. fire is another terrestrial factor that can be an important agent of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems. some organisms are adapted to fire and, thus, require the high heat associated with fire to complete a part of their life cycle. for example, the jack pinea coniferous treerequires heat from fire for its seed cones to open ([link]). through the burning of pine needles, fire adds nitrogen to the soil and limits competition by destroying undergrowth. temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic matter available as food (net primary productivity). net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration. in terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots. this means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement. net primary productivity is an important variable when considering differences in biomes. very productive biomes have a high level of aboveground biomass. annual biomass production is directly related to the abiotic components of the environment. environments with the greatest amount of biomass have conditions in which photosynthesis, plant growth, and the resulting net primary productivity are optimized. the climate of these areas is warm and wet. photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work most efficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the maximal amount of carbon dioxide (co2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production. the aboveground biomass produces several important resources for other living things, including habitat and food. conversely, dry and cold environments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass. the animal communities living there will also be affected by the decrease in available food. biogeography is the study of the geographic distribution of living things and the abiotic factors that affect their distribution. endemic species are species that are naturally found only in a specific geographic area. the distribution of living things is influenced by several environmental factors that are, in part, controlled by the latitude or elevation at which an organism is found. ocean upwelling and spring and fall turnovers are important processes regulating the distribution of nutrients and other abiotic factors important in aquatic ecosystems. energy sources, temperature, water, inorganic nutrients, and soil are factors limiting the distribution of living things in terrestrial systems. net primary productivity is a measure of the amount of biomass produced by a biome.","[('aquatic influence', 'aquatic influences'), ('biotic', 'biotics'), ('aboveground biomas', 'aboveground biomasses', 'aboveground biomass'), ('ocean upwelling', 'ocean upwellings'), ('energy source', 'energy sources'), ('fall and spring turnover', 'fall and spring turnovers', 'fall and springs turnover', 'fall and springs turnovers'), ('net primary productivity', 'net primary productivities', 'net primaries productivity', 'net primaries productivities'), ('water', 'waters'), ('soil', 'soils'), ('terrestrial environment', 'terrestrial environments'), ('biosphere', 'biospheres'), ('biome', 'biomes'), ('fall turnover', 'fall turnovers'), ('spring turnover', 'spring turnovers'), ('temperature', 'temperatures'), ('aquatic environment', 'aquatic environments'), ('thermocline', 'thermoclines'), ('abiotic', 'abiotics'), ('endemic', 'endemics'), ('biogeography', 'biogeographies'), ('terrestrial influence', 'terrestrial influences'), ('ecology', 'ecologies'), ('inorganic nutrient', 'inorganic nutrients')]"
233,stax-bio,44,Ecology and the Biosphere,3,m44858,Terrestrial Biomes,"the earths biomes are categorized into two major groups: terrestrial and aquatic. terrestrial biomes are based on land, while aquatic biomes include both ocean and freshwater biomes. the eight major terrestrial biomes on earth are each distinguished by characteristic temperatures and amount of precipitation. comparing the annual totals of precipitation and fluctuations in precipitation from one biome to another provides clues as to the importance of abiotic factors in the distribution of biomes. temperature variation on a daily and seasonal basis is also important for predicting the geographic distribution of the biome and the vegetation type in the biome. the distribution of these biomes shows that the same biome can occur in geographically distinct areas with similar climates ([link]). tropical wet forests are also referred to as tropical rainforests. this biome is found in equatorial regions ([link]). the vegetation is characterized by plants with broad leaves that fall off throughout the year. unlike the trees of deciduous forests, the trees in this biome do not have a seasonal loss of leaves associated with variations in temperature and sunlight; these forests are evergreen year-round. the temperature and sunlight profiles of tropical wet forests are very stable in comparison to that of other terrestrial biomes, with the temperatures ranging from 20 c to 34 c (68 f to 93 f). when one compares the annual temperature variation of tropical wet forests with that of other forest biomes, the lack of seasonal temperature variation in the tropical wet forest becomes apparent. this lack of seasonality leads to year-round plant growth, rather than the seasonal (spring, summer, and fall) growth seen in other biomes. in contrast to other ecosystems, tropical ecosystems do not have long days and short days during the yearly cycle. instead, a constant daily amount of sunlight (1112 hrs per day) provides more solar radiation, thereby, a longer period of time for plant growth. the annual rainfall in tropical wet forests ranges from 125 to 660 cm (50200 in) with some monthly variation. while sunlight and temperature remain fairly consistent, annual rainfall is highly variable. tropical wet forests have wet months in which there can be more than 30 cm (1112 in) of precipitation, as well as dry months in which there are fewer than 10 cm (3.5 in) of rainfall. however, the driest month of a tropical wet forest still exceeds the annual rainfall of some other biomes, such as deserts. tropical wet forests have high net primary productivity because the annual temperatures and precipitation values in these areas are ideal for plant growth. therefore, the extensive biomass present in the tropical wet forest leads to plant communities with very high species diversities ([link]). tropical wet forests have more species of trees than any other biome; on average between 100 and 300 species of trees are present in a single hectare (2.5 acres) of south america. one way to visualize this is to compare the distinctive horizontal layers within the tropical wet forest biome. on the forest floor is a sparse layer of plants and decaying plant matter. above that is an understory of short shrubby foliage. a layer of trees rises above this understory and is topped by a closed upper canopythe uppermost overhead layer of branches and leaves. some additional trees emerge through this closed upper canopy. these layers provide diverse and complex habitats for the variety of plants, fungi, animals, and other organisms within the tropical wet forests. for instance, epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants, which typically are not harmed. epiphytes are found throughout tropical wet forest biomes. many species of animals use the variety of plants and the complex structure of the tropical wet forests for food and shelter. some organisms live several meters above ground and have adapted to this arboreal lifestyle. savannas are grasslands with scattered trees, and they are located in africa, south america, and northern australia ([link]). savannas are hot, tropical areas with temperatures averaging from 24 c to 29 c (75 f to 84 f) and an annual rainfall of 1040 cm (3.915.7 in). savannas have an extensive dry season; for this reason, forest trees do not grow as well as they do in the tropical wet forest (or other forest biomes). as a result, within the grasses and forbs (herbaceous flowering plants) that dominate the savanna, there are relatively few trees ([link]). since fire is an important source of disturbance in this biome, plants have evolved well-developed root systems that allow them to quickly re-sprout after a fire. subtropical deserts exist between 15  and 30  north and south latitude and are centered on the tropics of cancer and capricorn ([link]). this biome is very dry; in some years, evaporation exceeds precipitation. subtropical hot deserts can have daytime soil surface temperatures above 60 c (140 f) and nighttime temperatures approaching 0 c (32 f). in cold deserts, temperatures can be as high as 25 c and can drop below -30 c (-22 f). subtropical deserts are characterized by low annual precipitation of fewer than 30 cm (12 in) with little monthly variation and lack of predictability in rainfall. in some cases, the annual rainfall can be as low as 2 cm (0.8 in) in subtropical deserts located in central australia (the outback) and northern africa. the vegetation and low animal diversity of this biome is closely related to this low and unpredictable precipitation. very dry deserts lack perennial vegetation that lives from one year to the next; instead, many plants are annuals that grow quickly and reproduce when rainfall does occur, then they die. many other plants in these areas are characterized by having a number of adaptations that conserve water, such as deep roots, reduced foliage, and water-storing stems ([link]). seed plants in the desert produce seeds that can be in dormancy for extended periods between rains. adaptations in desert animals include nocturnal behavior and burrowing. the chaparral is also called the scrub forest and is found in california, along the mediterranean sea, and along the southern coast of australia ([link]). the annual rainfall in this biome ranges from 65 cm to 75 cm (25.629.5 in), and the majority of the rain falls in the winter. summers are very dry and many chaparral plants are dormant during the summertime. the chaparral vegetation, shown in [link], is dominated by shrubs and is adapted to periodic fires, with some plants producing seeds that only germinate after a hot fire. the ashes left behind after a fire are rich in nutrients like nitrogen that fertilize the soil and promote plant regrowth. temperate grasslands are found throughout central north america, where they are also known as prairies; they are also in eurasia, where they are known as steppes ([link]). temperate grasslands have pronounced annual fluctuations in temperature with hot summers and cold winters. the annual temperature variation produces specific growing seasons for plants. plant growth is possible when temperatures are warm enough to sustain plant growth and when ample water is available, which occurs in the spring, summer, and fall. during much of the winter, temperatures are low, and water, which is stored in the form of ice, is not available for plant growth. annual precipitation ranges from 25 cm to 75 cm (9.829.5 in). because of relatively lower annual precipitation in temperate grasslands, there are few trees except for those found growing along rivers or streams. the dominant vegetation tends to consist of grasses and some prairies sustain populations of grazing animals [link]. the vegetation is very dense and the soils are fertile because the subsurface of the soil is packed with the roots and rhizomes (underground stems) of these grasses. the roots and rhizomes act to anchor plants into the ground and replenish the organic material (humus) in the soil when they die and decay. fires, mainly caused by lightning, are a natural disturbance in temperate grasslands. when fire is suppressed in temperate grasslands, the vegetation eventually converts to scrub and dense forests. often, the restoration or management of temperate grasslands requires the use of controlled burns to suppress the growth of trees and maintain the grasses. temperate forests are the most common biome in eastern north america, western europe, eastern asia, chile, and new zealand ([link]). this biome is found throughout mid-latitude regions. temperatures range between -30 c and 30 c (-22 f to 86 f) and drop to below freezing on an annual basis. these temperatures mean that temperate forests have defined growing seasons during the spring, summer, and early fall. precipitation is relatively constant throughout the year and ranges between 75 cm and 150 cm (29.559 in). because of the moderate annual rainfall and temperatures, deciduous trees are the dominant plant in this biome ([link]). deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and remain leafless in the winter. thus, no photosynthesis occurs in the deciduous trees during the dormant winter period. each spring, new leaves appear as the temperature increases. because of the dormant period, the net primary productivity of temperate forests is less than that of tropical wet forests. in addition, temperate forests show less diversity of tree species than tropical wet forest biomes. the trees of the temperate forests leaf out and shade much of the ground; however, this biome is more open than tropical wet forests because trees in the temperate forests do not grow as tall as the trees in tropical wet forests. the soils of the temperate forests are rich in inorganic and organic nutrients. this is due to the thick layer of leaf litter on forest floors. as this leaf litter decays, nutrients are returned to the soil. the leaf litter also protects soil from erosion, insulates the ground, and provides habitats for invertebrates (such as the pill bug or roly-poly, armadillidium  vulgare) and their predators, such as the red-backed salamander (plethodon cinereus). the boreal forest, also known as taiga or coniferous forest, is found south of the arctic circle and across most of canada, alaska, russia, and northern europe ([link]). this biome has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. the annual precipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm (15.739 in) and usually takes the form of snow. little evaporation occurs because of the cold temperatures. the long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the predominance of cold-tolerant cone-bearing plants. these are evergreen coniferous trees like pines, spruce, and fir, which retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round. evergreen trees can photosynthesize earlier in the spring than deciduous trees because less energy from the sun is required to warm a needle-like leaf than a broad leaf. this benefits evergreen trees, which grow faster than deciduous trees in the boreal forest. in addition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be acidic with little available nitrogen. leaves are a nitrogen-rich structure and deciduous trees must produce a new set of these nitrogen-rich structures each year. therefore, coniferous trees that retain nitrogen-rich needles may have a competitive advantage over the broad-leafed deciduous trees. the net primary productivity of boreal forests is lower than that of temperate forests and tropical wet forests. the aboveground biomass of boreal forests is high because these slow-growing tree species are long lived and accumulate standing biomass over time. plant species diversity is less than that seen in temperate forests and tropical wet forests. boreal forests lack the pronounced elements of the layered forest structure seen in tropical wet forests. the structure of a boreal forest is often only a tree layer and a ground layer ([link]). when conifer needles are dropped, they decompose more slowly than broad leaves; therefore, fewer nutrients are returned to the soil to fuel plant growth. the arctic tundra lies north of the subarctic boreal forest and is located throughout the arctic regions of the northern hemisphere ([link]). the average winter temperature is -34 c (-34 f) and the average summer temperature is from 3 c to 12 c (37 f52 f). plants in the arctic tundra have a very short growing season of approximately 1012 weeks. however, during this time, there are almost 24 hours of daylight and plant growth is rapid. the annual precipitation of the arctic tundra is very low with little annual variation in precipitation. and, as in the boreal forests, there is little evaporation due to the cold temperatures. plants in the arctic tundra are generally low to the ground ([link]). there is little species diversity, low net primary productivity, and low aboveground biomass. the soils of the arctic tundra may remain in a perennially frozen state referred to as permafrost. the permafrost makes it impossible for roots to penetrate deep into the soil and slows the decay of organic matter, which inhibits the release of nutrients from organic matter. during the growing season, the ground of the arctic tundra can be completely covered with plants or lichens. the earth has terrestrial biomes and aquatic biomes. aquatic biomes include both freshwater and marine environments. there are eight major terrestrial biomes: tropical wet forests, savannas, subtropical deserts, chaparral, temperate grasslands, temperate forests, boreal forests, and arctic tundra. the same biome can occur in different geographic locations with similar climates. temperature and precipitation, and variations in both, are key abiotic factors that shape the composition of animal and plant communities in terrestrial biomes. some biomes, such as temperate grasslands and temperate forests, have distinct seasons, with cold weather and hot weather alternating throughout the year. in warm, moist biomes, such as the tropical wet forest, net primary productivity is high, as warm temperatures, abundant water, and a year-round growing season fuel plant growth. other biomes, such as deserts and tundra, have low primary productivity due to extreme temperatures and a shortage of available water.","[('canopy', 'canopies'), ('arctic tundra', 'arctic tundras'), ('terrestrial biome', 'terrestrial biomes'), ('terrestrial environment', 'terrestrial environments'), ('subtropical desert', 'subtropical deserts'), ('biosphere', 'biospheres'), ('boreal forest', 'boreal forests'), ('temperate grassland', 'temperate grasslands'), ('temperate forest', 'temperate forests'), ('ecology', 'ecologies'), ('chaparral', 'chaparrals'), ('tropical wet forest', 'tropical wet forests'), ('permafrost', 'permafrosts')]"
234,stax-bio,44,Ecology and the Biosphere,4,m44859,Aquatic Biomes,"like terrestrial biomes, aquatic biomes are influenced by a series of abiotic factors. the aquatic mediumwater has different physical and chemical properties than air, however. even if the water in a pond or other body of water is perfectly clear (there are no suspended particles), water, on its own, absorbs light. as one descends into a deep body of water, there will eventually be a depth which the sunlight cannot reach. while there are some abiotic and biotic factors in a terrestrial ecosystem that might obscure light (like fog, dust, or insect swarms), usually these are not permanent features of the environment. the importance of light in aquatic biomes is central to the communities of organisms found in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. in freshwater systems, stratification due to differences in density is perhaps the most critical abiotic factor and is related to the energy aspects of light. the thermal properties of water (rates of heating and cooling) are significant to the function of marine systems and have major impacts on global climate and weather patterns. marine systems are also influenced by large-scale physical water movements, such as currents; these are less important in most freshwater lakes. the ocean is categorized by several areas or zones ([link]). all of the oceans open water is referred to as the pelagic realm (or zone). the benthic realm (or zone) extends along the ocean bottom from the shoreline to the deepest parts of the ocean floor. within the pelagic realm is the photic zone, which is the portion of the ocean that light can penetrate (approximately 200 m or 650 ft). at depths greater than 200 m, light cannot penetrate; thus, this is referred to as the aphotic zone. the majority of the ocean is aphotic and lacks sufficient light for photosynthesis. the deepest part of the ocean, the challenger deep (in the mariana trench, located in the western pacific ocean), is about 11,000 m (about 6.8 mi) deep. to give some perspective on the depth of this trench, the ocean is, on average, 4267 m or 14,000 ft deep. these realms and zones are relevant to freshwater lakes as well. the ocean is the largest marine biome. it is a continuous body of salt water that is relatively uniform in chemical composition; it is a weak solution of mineral salts and decayed biological matter. within the ocean, coral reefs are a second kind of marine biome. estuaries, coastal areas where salt water and fresh water mix, form a third unique marine biome. the physical diversity of the ocean is a significant influence on plants, animals, and other organisms. the ocean is categorized into different zones based on how far light reaches into the water. each zone has a distinct group of species adapted to the biotic and abiotic conditions particular to that zone. the intertidal zone, which is the zone between high and low tide, is the oceanic region that is closest to land ([link]). generally, most people think of this portion of the ocean as a sandy beach. in some cases, the intertidal zone is indeed a sandy beach, but it can also be rocky or muddy. the intertidal zone is an extremely variable environment because of tides. organisms are exposed to air and sunlight at low tide and are underwater most of the time, especially during high tide. therefore, living things that thrive in the intertidal zone are adapted to being dry for long periods of time. the shore of the intertidal zone is also repeatedly struck by waves, and the organisms found there are adapted to withstand damage from the pounding action of the waves ([link]). the exoskeletons of shoreline crustaceans (such as the shore crab, carcinus maenas) are tough and protect them from desiccation (drying out) and wave damage. another consequence of the pounding waves is that few algae and plants establish themselves in the constantly moving rocks, sand, or mud. the neritic zone ([link]) extends from the intertidal zone to depths of about 200 m (or 650 ft) at the edge of the continental shelf. since light can penetrate this depth, photosynthesis can occur in the neritic zone. the water here contains silt and is well-oxygenated, low in pressure, and stable in temperature. phytoplankton and floating sargassum (a type of free-floating marine seaweed) provide a habitat for some sea life found in the neritic zone. zooplankton, protists, small fishes, and shrimp are found in the neritic zone and are the base of the food chain for most of the worlds fisheries. beyond the neritic zone is the open ocean area known as the oceanic zone ([link]). within the oceanic zone there is thermal stratification where warm and cold waters mix because of ocean currents. abundant plankton serve as the base of the food chain for larger animals such as whales and dolphins. nutrients are scarce and this is a relatively less productive part of the marine biome. when photosynthetic organisms and the protists and animals that feed on them die, their bodies fall to the bottom of the ocean where they remain; unlike freshwater lakes, the open ocean lacks a process for bringing the organic nutrients back up to the surface. the majority of organisms in the aphotic zone include sea cucumbers (phylum echinodermata) and other organisms that survive on the nutrients contained in the dead bodies of organisms in the photic zone. beneath the pelagic zone is the benthic realm, the deepwater region beyond the continental shelf ([link]). the bottom of the benthic realm is comprised of sand, silt, and dead organisms. temperature decreases, remaining above freezing, as water depth increases. this is a nutrient-rich portion of the ocean because of the dead organisms that fall from the upper layers of the ocean. because of this high level of nutrients, a diversity of fungi, sponges, sea anemones, marine worms, sea stars, fishes, and bacteria exist. the deepest part of the ocean is the abyssal zone, which is at depths of 4000 m or greater. the abyssal zone ([link]) is very cold and has very high pressure, high oxygen content, and low nutrient content. there are a variety of invertebrates and fishes found in this zone, but the abyssal zone does not have plants because of the lack of light. hydrothermal vents are found primarily in the abyssal zone; chemosynthetic bacteria utilize the hydrogen sulfide and other minerals emitted from the vents. these chemosynthetic bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide as an energy source and serve as the base of the food chain found in the abyssal zone. coral reefs are ocean ridges formed by marine invertebrates living in warm shallow waters within the photic zone of the ocean. they are found within 30 north and south of the equator. the great barrier reef is a well-known reef system located several miles off the northeastern coast of australia. other coral reef systems are fringing islands, which are directly adjacent to land, or atolls, which are circular reef systems surrounding a former landmass that is now underwater. the coral organisms (members of phylum cnidaria) are colonies of saltwater polyps that secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton. these calcium-rich skeletons slowly accumulate, forming the underwater reef ([link]). corals found in shallower waters (at a depth of approximately 60 m or about 200 ft) have a mutualistic relationship with photosynthetic unicellular algae. the relationship provides corals with the majority of the nutrition and the energy they require. the waters in which these corals live are nutritionally poor and, without this mutualism, it would not be possible for large corals to grow. some corals living in deeper and colder water do not have a mutualistic relationship with algae; these corals attain energy and nutrients using stinging cells on their tentacles to capture prey. it is estimated that more than 4,000 fish species inhabit coral reefs. these fishes can feed on coral, the cryptofauna (invertebrates found within the calcium carbonate substrate of the coral reefs), or the seaweed and algae that are associated with the coral. in addition, some fish species inhabit the boundaries of a coral reef; these species include predators, herbivores, or planktivores. predators are animal species that hunt and are carnivores or flesh eaters. herbivores eat plant material, and planktivores eat plankton. global decline of coral reefs
it takes a long time to build a coral reef. the animals that create coral reefs have evolved over millions of years, continuing to slowly deposit the calcium carbonate that forms their characteristic ocean homes. bathed in warm tropical waters, the coral animals and their symbiotic algal partners evolved to survive at the upper limit of ocean water temperature. together, climate change and human activity pose dual threats to the long-term survival of the worlds coral reefs. as global warming due to fossil fuel emissions raises ocean temperatures, coral reefs are suffering. the excessive warmth causes the reefs to expel their symbiotic, food-producing algae, resulting in a phenomenon known as bleaching. when bleaching occurs, the reefs lose much of their characteristic color as the algae and the coral animals die if loss of the symbiotic zooxanthellae is prolonged. rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways; as co2 dissolves in ocean waters, it lowers the ph and increases ocean acidity. as acidity increases, it interferes with the calcification that normally occurs as coral animals build their calcium carbonate homes. when a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter. coral reefs are also economically important tourist destinations, so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious threat to coastal economies. human population growth has damaged corals in other ways, too. as human coastal populations increase, the runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals has increased, too, causing some of the once-clear tropical waters to become cloudy. at the same time, overfishing of popular fish species has allowed the predator species that eat corals to go unchecked. although a rise in global temperatures of 12c (a conservative scientific projection) in the coming decades may not seem large, it is very significant to this biome. when change occurs rapidly, species can become extinct before evolution leads to new adaptations. many scientists believe that global warming, with its rapid (in terms of evolutionary time) and inexorable increases in temperature, is tipping the balance beyond the point at which many of the worlds coral reefs can recover. estuaries are biomes that occur where a source of fresh water, such as a river, meets the ocean. therefore, both fresh water and salt water are found in the same vicinity; mixing results in a diluted (brackish) saltwater. estuaries form protected areas where many of the young offspring of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish begin their lives. salinity is a very important factor that influences the organisms and the adaptations of the organisms found in estuaries. the salinity of estuaries varies and is based on the rate of flow of its freshwater sources. once or twice a day, high tides bring salt water into the estuary. low tides occurring at the same frequency reverse the current of salt water. the short-term and rapid variation in salinity due to the mixing of fresh water and salt water is a difficult physiological challenge for the plants and animals that inhabit estuaries. many estuarine plant species are halophytes: plants that can tolerate salty conditions. halophytic plants are adapted to deal with the salinity resulting from saltwater on their roots or from sea spray. in some halophytes, filters in the roots remove the salt from the water that the plant absorbs. other plants are able to pump oxygen into their roots. animals, such as mussels and clams (phylum mollusca), have developed behavioral adaptations that expend a lot of energy to function in this rapidly changing environment. when these animals are exposed to low salinity, they stop feeding, close their shells, and switch from aerobic respiration (in which they use gills) to anaerobic respiration (a process that does not require oxygen). when high tide returns to the estuary, the salinity and oxygen content of the water increases, and these animals open their shells, begin feeding, and return to aerobic respiration. freshwater biomes include lakes and ponds (standing water) as well as rivers and streams (flowing water). they also include wetlands, which will be discussed later. humans rely on freshwater biomes to provide aquatic resources for drinking water, crop irrigation, sanitation, and industry. these various roles and human benefits are referred to as ecosystem services. lakes and ponds are found in terrestrial landscapes and are, therefore, connected with abiotic and biotic factors influencing these terrestrial biomes. lakes and ponds can range in area from a few square meters to thousands of square kilometers. temperature is an important abiotic factor affecting living things found in lakes and ponds. in the summer, thermal stratification of lakes and ponds occurs when the upper layer of water is warmed by the sun and does not mix with deeper, cooler water. light can penetrate within the photic zone of the lake or pond. phytoplankton (algae and cyanobacteria) are found here and carry out photosynthesis, providing the base of the food web of lakes and ponds. zooplankton, such as rotifers and small crustaceans, consume these phytoplankton. at the bottom of lakes and ponds, bacteria in the aphotic zone break down dead organisms that sink to the bottom. nitrogen and phosphorus are important limiting nutrients in lakes and ponds. because of this, they are determining factors in the amount of phytoplankton growth in lakes and ponds. when there is a large input of nitrogen and phosphorus (from sewage and runoff from fertilized lawns and farms, for example), the growth of algae skyrockets, resulting in a large accumulation of algae called an algal bloom. algal blooms ([link]) can become so extensive that they reduce light penetration in water. as a result, the lake or pond becomes aphotic and photosynthetic plants cannot survive. when the algae die and decompose, severe oxygen depletion of the water occurs. fishes and other organisms that require oxygen are then more likely to die, and resulting dead zones are found across the globe. lake erie and the gulf of mexico represent freshwater and marine habitats where phosphorus control and storm water runoff pose significant environmental challenges. rivers and streams are continuously moving bodies of water that carry large amounts of water from the source, or headwater, to a lake or ocean. the largest rivers include the nile river in africa, the amazon river in south america, and the mississippi river in north america. abiotic features of rivers and streams vary along the length of the river or stream. streams begin at a point of origin referred to as source water. the source water is usually cold, low in nutrients, and clear. the channel (the width of the river or stream) is narrower than at any other place along the length of the river or stream. because of this, the current is often faster here than at any other point of the river or stream. the fast-moving water results in minimal silt accumulation at the bottom of the river or stream; therefore, the water is clear. photosynthesis here is mostly attributed to algae that are growing on rocks; the swift current inhibits the growth of phytoplankton. an additional input of energy can come from leaves or other organic material that falls into the river or stream from trees and other plants that border the water. when the leaves decompose, the organic material and nutrients in the leaves are returned to the water. plants and animals have adapted to this fast-moving water. for instance, leeches (phylum annelida) have elongated bodies and suckers on both ends. these suckers attach to the substrate, keeping the leech anchored in place. freshwater trout species (phylum chordata) are an important predator in these fast-moving rivers and streams. as the river or stream flows away from the source, the width of the channel gradually widens and the current slows. this slow-moving water, caused by the gradient decrease and the volume increase as tributaries unite, has more sedimentation. phytoplankton can also be suspended in slow-moving water. therefore, the water will not be as clear as it is near the source. the water is also warmer. worms (phylum annelida) and insects (phylum arthropoda) can be found burrowing into the mud. the higher order predator vertebrates (phylum chordata) include waterfowl, frogs, and fishes. these predators must find food in these slow moving, sometimes murky, waters and, unlike the trout in the waters at the source, these vertebrates may not be able to use vision as their primary sense to find food. instead, they are more likely to use taste or chemical cues to find prey. wetlands are environments in which the soil is either permanently or periodically saturated with water. wetlands are different from lakes because wetlands are shallow bodies of water whereas lakes vary in depth. emergent vegetation consists of wetland plants that are rooted in the soil but have portions of leaves, stems, and flowers extending above the waters surface. there are several types of wetlands including marshes, swamps, bogs, mudflats, and salt marshes ([link]). the three shared characteristics among these typeswhat makes them wetlandsare their hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydric soils. freshwater marshes and swamps are characterized by slow and steady water flow. bogs develop in depressions where water flow is low or nonexistent. bogs usually occur in areas where there is a clay bottom with poor percolation. percolation is the movement of water through the pores in the soil or rocks. the water found in a bog is stagnant and oxygen depleted because the oxygen that is used during the decomposition of organic matter is not replaced. as the oxygen in the water is depleted, decomposition slows. this leads to organic acids and other acids building up and lowering the ph of the water. at a lower ph, nitrogen becomes unavailable to plants. this creates a challenge for plants because nitrogen is an important limiting resource. some types of bog plants (such as sundews, pitcher plants, and venus flytraps) capture insects and extract the nitrogen from their bodies. bogs have low net primary productivity because the water found in bogs has low levels of nitrogen and oxygen. aquatic ecosystems include both saltwater and freshwater biomes. the abiotic factors important for the structuring of aquatic ecosystems can be different than those seen in terrestrial systems. sunlight is a driving force behind the structure of forests and also is an important factor in bodies of water, especially those that are very deep, because of the role of photosynthesis in sustaining certain organisms. density and temperature shape the structure of aquatic systems. oceans may be thought of as consisting of different zones based on water depth and distance from the shoreline and light penetrance. different kinds of organisms are adapted to the conditions found in each zone. coral reefs are unique marine ecosystems that are home to a wide variety of species. estuaries are found where rivers meet the ocean; their shallow waters provide nourishment and shelter for young crustaceans, mollusks, fishes, and many other species. freshwater biomes include lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and wetlands. bogs are an interesting type of wetland characterized by standing water, lower ph, and a lack of nitrogen.","[('aphotic zone', 'aphotic zones'), ('abyssal zone', 'abyssal zones'), ('neritic zone', 'neritic zones'), ('source water', 'source waters'), ('stream', 'streams'), ('cryptofauna', 'cryptofaunas'), ('planktivore', 'planktivores'), ('algal bloom', 'algal blooms'), ('oceanic zone', 'oceanic zones'), ('coral reef', 'coral reefs'), ('pond', 'ponds'), ('freshwater biome', 'freshwater biomes'), ('channel', 'channels'), ('benthic realm', 'benthic realms'), ('estuary', 'estuariess', 'estuaries'), ('pelagic realm', 'pelagic realms'), ('marine biome', 'marine biomes'), ('sargassum', 'sargassums'), ('aquatic biome', 'aquatic biomes'), ('aquatic environment', 'aquatic environments'), ('lake', 'lakes'), ('intertidal zone', 'intertidal zones'), ('ecosystem service', 'ecosystem services'), ('biosphere', 'biospheres'), ('wetland', 'wetlands'), ('estuary', 'estuaries'), ('river', 'rivers'), ('emergent vegetation', 'emergent vegetations'), ('ecology', 'ecologies'), ('predator', 'predators'), ('photic zone', 'photic zones')]"
235,stax-bio,44,Ecology and the Biosphere,5,m44861,Climate and the Effects of Global Climate Change,"all biomes are universally affected by global conditions, such as climate, that ultimately shape each biomes environment. scientists who study climate have noted a series of marked changes that have gradually become increasingly evident during the last sixty years. global climate change is the term used to describe altered global weather patterns, including a worldwide increase in temperature, due largely to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. a common misconception about global climate change is that a specific weather event occurring in a particular region (for example, a very cool week in june in central indiana) is evidence of global climate change. however, a cold week in june is a weather-related event and not a climate-related one. these misconceptions often arise because of confusion over the terms climate and weather. climate refers to the long-term, predictable atmospheric conditions of a specific area. the climate of a biome is characterized by having consistent temperature and annual rainfall ranges. climate does not address the amount of rain that fell on one particular day in a biome or the colder-than-average temperatures that occurred on one day. in contrast, weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere during a short period of time. weather forecasts are usually made for 48-hour cycles. long-range weather forecasts are available but can be unreliable. to better understand the difference between climate and weather, imagine that you are planning an outdoor event in northern wisconsin. you would be thinking about climate when you plan the event in the summer rather than the winter because you have long-term knowledge that any given saturday in the months of may to august would be a better choice for an outdoor event in wisconsin than any given saturday in january. however, you cannot determine the specific day that the event should be held on because it is difficult to accurately predict the weather on a specific day. climate can be considered average weather. climate change can be understood by approaching three areas of study: it is helpful to keep these three different aspects of climate change clearly separated when consuming media reports about global climate change. it is common for reports and discussions about global climate change to confuse the data showing that earths climate is changing with the factors that drive this climate change. since scientists cannot go back in time to directly measure climatic variables, such as average temperature and precipitation, they must instead indirectly measure temperature. to do this, scientists rely on historical evidence of earths past climate. antarctic ice cores are a key example of such evidence. these ice cores are samples of polar ice obtained by means of drills that reach thousands of meters into ice sheets or high mountain glaciers. viewing the ice cores is like traveling backwards through time; the deeper the sample, the earlier the time period. trapped within the ice are bubbles of air and other biological evidence that can reveal temperature and carbon dioxide data. antarctic ice cores have been collected and analyzed to indirectly estimate the temperature of the earth over the past 400,000 years ([link]a). the 0 c on this graph refers to the long-term average. temperatures that are greater than 0 c exceed earths long-term average temperature. conversely, temperatures that are less than 0 c are less than earths average temperature. this figure shows that there have been periodic cycles of increasing and decreasing temperature. before the late 1800s, the earth has been as much as 9 c cooler and about 3 c warmer. note that the graph in [link]b shows that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has also risen and fallen in periodic cycles; note the relationship between carbon dioxide concentration and temperature. [link]b shows that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have historically cycled between 180 and 300 parts per million (ppm) by volume. [link]a does not show the last 2,000 years with enough detail to compare the changes of earths temperature during the last 400,000 years with the temperature change that has occurred in the more recent past. two significant temperature anomalies, or irregularities, have occurred in the last 2000 years. these are the medieval climate anomaly (or the medieval warm period) and the little ice age. a third temperature anomaly aligns with the industrial era. the medieval climate anomaly occurred between 900 and 1300 ad. during this time period, many climate scientists think that slightly warmer weather conditions prevailed in many parts of the world; the higher-than-average temperature changes varied between 0.10 c and 0.20 c above the norm. although 0.10 c does not seem large enough to produce any noticeable change, it did free seas of ice. because of this warming, the vikings were able to colonize greenland. the little ice age was a cold period that occurred between 1550 ad and 1850 ad. during this time, a slight cooling of a little less than 1 c was observed in north america, europe, and possibly other areas of the earth. this 1 c change in global temperature is a seemingly small deviation in temperature (as was observed during the medieval climate anomaly); however, it also resulted in noticeable changes. historical accounts reveal a time of exceptionally harsh winters with much snow and frost. the industrial revolution, which began around 1750, was characterized by changes in much of human society. advances in agriculture increased the food supply, which improved the standard of living for people in europe and the united states. new technologies were invented and provided jobs and cheaper goods. these new technologies were powered using fossil fuels, especially coal. the industrial revolution starting in the early nineteenth century ushered in the beginning of the industrial era. when a fossil fuel is burned, carbon dioxide is released. with the beginning of the industrial era, atmospheric carbon dioxide began to rise ([link]). since it is not possible to go back in time to directly observe and measure climate, scientists use indirect evidence to determine the drivers, or factors, that may be responsible for climate change. the indirect evidence includes data collected using ice cores, boreholes (a narrow shaft bored into the ground), tree rings, glacier lengths, pollen remains, and ocean sediments. the data shows a correlation between the timing of temperature changes and drivers of climate change: before the industrial era (pre-1780), there were three drivers of climate change that were not related to human activity or atmospheric gases. the first of these is the milankovitch cycles. the milankovitch cycles describe the effects of slight changes in the earths orbit on earths climate. the length of the milankovitch cycles ranges between 19,000 and 100,000 years. in other words, one could expect to see some predictable changes in the earths climate associated with changes in the earths orbit at a minimum of every 19,000 years. the variation in the suns intensity is the second natural factor responsible for climate change. solar intensity is the amount of solar power or energy the sun emits in a given amount of time. there is a direct relationship between solar intensity and temperature. as solar intensity increases (or decreases), the earths temperature correspondingly increases (or decreases). changes in solar intensity have been proposed as one of several possible explanations for the little ice age. finally, volcanic eruptions are a third natural driver of climate change. volcanic eruptions can last a few days, but the solids and gases released during an eruption can influence the climate over a period of a few years, causing short-term climate changes. the gases and solids released by volcanic eruptions can include carbon dioxide, water vapor, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. generally, volcanic eruptions cool the climate. this occurred in 1783 when volcanos in iceland erupted and caused the release of large volumes of sulfuric oxide. this led to haze-effect cooling, a global phenomenon that occurs when dust, ash, or other suspended particles block out sunlight and trigger lower global temperatures as a result; haze-effect cooling usually extends for one or more years. in europe and north america, haze-effect cooling produced some of the lowest average winter temperatures on record in 1783 and 1784. greenhouse gases are probably the most significant drivers of the climate. when heat energy from the sun strikes the earth, gases known as greenhouse gases trap the heat in the atmosphere, as do the glass panes of a greenhouse keep heat from escaping. the greenhouse gases that affect earth include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, nitrous oxide, and ozone. approximately half of the radiation from the sun passes through these gases in the atmosphere and strikes the earth. this radiation is converted into thermal radiation on the earths surface, and then a portion of that energy is re-radiated back into the atmosphere. greenhouse gases, however, reflect much of the thermal energy back to the earths surface. the more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more thermal energy is reflected back to the earths surface. greenhouse gases absorb and emit radiation and are an important factor in the greenhouse effect: the warming of earth due to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. evidence supports the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and temperature: as carbon dioxide rises, global temperature rises. since 1950, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about 280 ppm to 382 ppm in 2006. in 2011, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was 392 ppm. however, the planet would not be inhabitable by current life forms if water vapor did not produce its drastic greenhouse warming effect. scientists look at patterns in data and try to explain differences or deviations from these patterns. the atmospheric carbon dioxide data reveal a historical pattern of carbon dioxide increasing and decreasing, cycling between a low of 180 ppm and a high of 300 ppm. scientists have concluded that it took around 50,000 years for the atmospheric carbon dioxide level to increase from its low minimum concentration to its higher maximum concentration. however, starting recently, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have increased beyond the historical maximum of 300 ppm. the current increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide have happened very quicklyin a matter of hundreds of years rather than thousands of years. what is the reason for this difference in the rate of change and the amount of increase in carbon dioxide? a key factor that must be recognized when comparing the historical data and the current data is the presence of modern human society; no other driver of climate change has yielded changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at this rate or to this magnitude. human activity releases carbon dioxide and methane, two of the most important greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere in several ways. the primary mechanism that releases carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels, such as gasoline, coal, and natural gas ([link]). deforestation, cement manufacture, animal agriculture, the clearing of land, and the burning of forests are other human activities that release carbon dioxide. methane (ch4) is produced when bacteria break down organic matter under anaerobic conditions. anaerobic conditions can happen when organic matter is trapped underwater (such as in rice paddies) or in the intestines of herbivores. methane can also be released from natural gas fields and the decomposition that occurs in landfills. another source of methane is the melting of clathrates. clathrates are frozen chunks of ice and methane found at the bottom of the ocean. when water warms, these chunks of ice melt and methane is released. as the oceans water temperature increases, the rate at which clathrates melt is increasing, releasing even more methane. this leads to increased levels of methane in the atmosphere, which further accelerates the rate of global warming. this is an example of the positive feedback loop that is leading to the rapid rate of increase of global temperatures. scientists have geological evidence of the consequences of long-ago climate change. modern-day phenomena such as retreating glaciers and melting polar ice cause a continual rise in sea level. meanwhile, changes in climate can negatively affect organisms. global warming has been associated with at least one planet-wide extinction event during the geological past. the permian extinction event occurred about 251 million years ago toward the end of the roughly 50-million-year-long geological time span known as the permian period. this geologic time period was one of the three warmest periods in earths geologic history. scientists estimate that approximately 70 percent of the terrestrial plant and animal species and 84 percent of marine species became extinct, vanishing forever near the end of the permian period. organisms that had adapted to wet and warm climatic conditions, such as annual rainfall of 300400 cm (118157 in) and 20 c30 c (68 f86 f) in the tropical wet forest, may not have been able to survive the permian climate change. a number of global events have occurred that may be attributed to climate change during our lifetimes. glacier national park in montana is undergoing the retreat of many of its glaciers, a phenomenon known as glacier recession. in 1850, the area contained approximately 150 glaciers. by 2010, however, the park contained only about 24 glaciers greater than 25 acres in size. one of these glaciers is the grinnell glacier ([link]) at mount gould. between 1966 and 2005, the size of grinnell glacier shrank by 40 percent. similarly, the mass of the ice sheets in greenland and the antarctic is decreasing: greenland lost 150250 km3 of ice per year between 2002 and 2006. in addition, the size and thickness of the arctic sea ice is decreasing. this loss of ice is leading to increases in the global sea level. on average, the sea is rising at a rate of 1.8 mm per year. however, between 1993 and 2010 the rate of sea level increase ranged between 2.9 and 3.4 mm per year. a variety of factors affect the volume of water in the ocean, including the temperature of the water (the density of water is related to its temperature) and the amount of water found in rivers, lakes, glaciers, polar ice caps, and sea ice. as glaciers and polar ice caps melt, there is a significant contribution of liquid water that was previously frozen. in addition to some abiotic conditions changing in response to climate change, many organisms are also being affected by the changes in temperature. temperature and precipitation play key roles in determining the geographic distribution and phenology of plants and animals. (phenology is the study of the effects of climatic conditions on the timing of periodic lifecycle events, such as flowering in plants or migration in birds.) researchers have shown that 385 plant species in great britain are flowering 4.5 days sooner than was recorded earlier during the previous 40 years. in addition, insect-pollinated species were more likely to flower earlier than wind-pollinated species. the impact of changes in flowering date would be mitigated if the insect pollinators emerged earlier. this mismatched timing of plants and pollinators could result in injurious ecosystem effects because, for continued survival, insect-pollinated plants must flower when their pollinators are present. the earth has gone through periodic cycles of increases and decreases in temperature. during the past 2000 years, the medieval climate anomaly was a warmer period, while the little ice age was unusually cool. both of these irregularities can be explained by natural causes of changes in climate, and, although the temperature changes were small, they had significant effects. natural drivers of climate change include milankovitch cycles, changes in solar activity, and volcanic eruptions. none of these factors, however, leads to rapid increases in global temperature or sustained increases in carbon dioxide. the burning of fossil fuels is an important source of greenhouse gases, which plays a major role in the greenhouse effect. long ago, global warming resulted in the permian extinction: a large-scale extinction event that is documented in the fossil record. currently, modern-day climate change is associated with the increased melting of glaciers and polar ice sheets, resulting in a gradual increase in sea level. plants and animals can also be affected by global climate change when the timing of seasonal events, such as flowering or pollination, is affected by global warming.","[('global warming', 'global warmings'), ('global climate change', 'global climate changes', 'global climates change', 'global climates changes'), ('geological climate change', 'geological climate changes', 'geological climates change', 'geological climates changes'), ('industrial revolution', 'industrial revolutions'), ('atmospheric carbon dioxide', 'atmospheric carbon dioxides', 'atmospheric carbons dioxide', 'atmospheric carbons dioxides'), ('milankovitch cycle', 'milankovitch cycles'), ('climate change', 'climate changes'), ('climate', 'climates'), ('weather', 'weathers'), ('present climate change', 'present climate changes', 'present climates change', 'present climates changes'), ('greenhouse effect', 'greenhouse effects'), ('clathrate', 'clathrates'), ('global climate', 'global climates'), ('solar intensity', 'solar intensities'), ('ecology', 'ecologies'), ('haze-effect cooling', 'haze-effect coolings'), ('biosphere', 'biospheres'), ('greenhouse ga', 'greenhouse gas')]"

237,stax-bio,45,Population and Community Ecology,1,m44864,Population Demography,"populations are dynamic entities. populations consist all of the species living within a specific area, and populations fluctuate based on a number of factors: seasonal and yearly changes in the environment, natural disasters such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions, and competition for resources between and within species. the statistical study of population dynamics, demography, uses a series of mathematical tools to investigate how populations respond to changes in their biotic and abiotic environments. many of these tools were originally designed to study human populations. for example, life tables, which detail the life expectancy of individuals within a population, were initially developed by life insurance companies to set insurance rates. in fact, while the term demographics is commonly used when discussing humans, all living populations can be studied using this approach. the study of any population usually begins by determining how many individuals of a particular species exist, and how closely associated they are with each other. within a particular habitat, a population can be characterized by its population size (n), the total number of individuals, and its population density, the number of individuals within a specific area or volume. population size and density are the two main characteristics used to describe and understand populations. for example, populations with more individuals may be more stable than smaller populations based on their genetic variability, and thus their potential to adapt to the environment. alternatively, a member of a population with low population density (more spread out in the habitat), might have more difficulty finding a mate to reproduce compared to a population of higher density. as is shown in [link], smaller organisms tend to be more densely distributed than larger organisms. the most accurate way to determine population size is to simply count all of the individuals within the habitat. however, this method is often not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large habitats. thus, scientists usually study populations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and using this data to make inferences about the habitat as a whole. a variety of methods can be used to sample populations to determine their size and density. for immobile organisms such as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms, a quadrat may be used ([link]). a quadrat is a way of marking off square areas within a habitat, either by staking out an area with sticks and string, or by the use of a wood, plastic, or metal square placed on the ground. after setting the quadrats, researchers then count the number of individuals that lie within their boundaries. multiple quadrat samples are performed throughout the habitat at several random locations. all of this data can then be used to estimate the population size and population density within the entire habitat. the number and size of quadrat samples depends on the type of organisms under study and other factors, including the density of the organism. for example, if sampling daffodils, a 1 m2 quadrat might be used whereas with giant redwoods, which are larger and live much further apart from each other, a larger quadrat of 100 m2 might be employed. this ensures that enough individuals of the species are counted to get an accurate sample that correlates with the habitat, including areas not sampled. for mobile organisms, such as mammals, birds, or fish, a technique called mark and recapture is often used. this method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way (such as tags, bands, paint, or other body markings), and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population; later, a new sample is collected, including some individuals that are marked (recaptures) and some individuals that are unmarked ([link]). using the ratio of marked and unmarked individuals, scientists determine how many individuals are in the sample. from this, calculations are used to estimate the total population size. this method assumes that the larger the population, the lower the percentage of tagged organisms that will be recaptured since they will have mixed with more untagged individuals. for example, if 80 deer are captured, tagged, and released into the forest, and later 100 deer are captured and 20 of them are already marked, we can determine the population size (n) using the following equation: using our example, the population size would be estimated at 400. therefore, there are an estimated 400 total individuals in the original population. there are some limitations to the mark and recapture method. some animals from the first catch may learn to avoid capture in the second round, thus inflating population estimates. alternatively, animals may preferentially be retrapped (especially if a food reward is offered), resulting in an underestimate of population size. also, some species may be harmed by the marking technique, reducing their survival. a variety of other techniques have been developed, including the electronic tracking of animals tagged with radio transmitters and the use of data from commercial fishing and trapping operations to estimate the size and health of populations and communities. in addition to measuring simple density, further information about a population can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the individuals. species dispersion patterns (or distribution patterns) show the spatial relationship between members of a population within a habitat at a particular point in time. in other words, they show whether members of the species live close together or far apart, and what patterns are evident when they are spaced apart. individuals in a population can be more or less equally spaced apart, dispersed randomly with no predictable pattern, or clustered in groups. these are known as uniform, random, and clumped dispersion patterns, respectively ([link]). uniform dispersion is observed in plants that secrete substances inhibiting the growth of nearby individuals (such as the release of toxic chemicals by the sage plant salvia leucophylla, a phenomenon called allelopathy) and in animals like the penguin that maintain a defined territory. an example of random dispersion occurs with dandelion and other plants that have wind-dispersed seeds that germinate wherever they happen to fall in a favorable environment. a clumped dispersion may be seen in plants that drop their seeds straight to the ground, such as oak trees, or animals that live in groups (schools of fish or herds of elephants). clumped dispersions may also be a function of habitat heterogeneity. thus, the dispersion of the individuals within a population provides more information about how they interact with each other than does a simple density measurement. just as lower density species might have more difficulty finding a mate, solitary species with a random distribution might have a similar difficulty when compared to social species clumped together in groups. while population size and density describe a population at one particular point in time, scientists must use demography to study the dynamics of a population. demography is the statistical study of population changes over time: birth rates, death rates, and life expectancies. each of these measures, especially birth rates, may be affected by the population characteristics described above. for example, a large population size results in a higher birth rate because more potentially reproductive individuals are present. in contrast, a large population size can also result in a higher death rate because of competition, disease, and the accumulation of waste. similarly, a higher population density or a clumped dispersion pattern results in more potential reproductive encounters between individuals, which can increase birth rate. lastly, a female-biased sex ratio (the ratio of males to females) or age structure (the proportion of population members at specific age ranges) composed of many individuals of reproductive age can increase birth rates. in addition, the demographic characteristics of a population can influence how the population grows or declines over time. if birth and death rates are equal, the population remains stable. however, the population size will increase if birth rates exceed death rates; the population will decrease if birth rates are less than death rates. life expectancy is another important factor; the length of time individuals remain in the population impacts local resources, reproduction, and the overall health of the population. these demographic characteristics are often displayed in the form of a life table. life tables provide important information about the life history of an organism. life tables divide the population into age groups and often sexes, and show how long a member of that group is likely to live. they are modeled after actuarial tables used by the insurance industry for estimating human life expectancy. life tables may include the probability of individuals dying before their next birthday (i.e., their mortality rate), the percentage of surviving individuals dying at a particular age interval, and their life expectancy at each interval. an example of a life table is shown in [link] from a study of dall mountain sheep, a species native to northwestern north america. notice that the population is divided into age intervals (column a). the mortality rate (per 1000), shown in column d, is based on the number of individuals dying during the age interval (column b) divided by the number of individuals surviving at the beginning of the interval (column c), multiplied by 1000. for example, between ages three and four, 12 individuals die out of the 776 that were remaining from the original 1000 sheep. this number is then multiplied by 1000 to get the mortality rate per thousand. as can be seen from the mortality rate data (column d), a high death rate occurred when the sheep were between 6 and 12 months old, and then increased even more from 8 to 12 years old, after which there were few survivors. the data indicate that if a sheep in this population were to survive to age one, it could be expected to live another 7.7 years on average, as shown by the life expectancy numbers in column e. another tool used by population ecologists is a survivorship curve, which is a graph of the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time (usually with data compiled from a life table). these curves allow us to compare the life histories of different populations ([link]). humans and most primates exhibit a type i survivorship curve because a high percentage of offspring survive their early and middle yearsdeath occurs predominantly in older individuals. these types of species usually have small numbers of offspring at one time, and they give a high amount of parental care to them to ensure their survival. birds are an example of an intermediate or type ii survivorship curve because birds die more or less equally at each age interval. these organisms also may have relatively few offspring and provide significant parental care. trees, marine invertebrates, and most fishes exhibit a type iii survivorship curve because very few of these organisms survive their younger years; however, those that make it to an old age are more likely to survive for a relatively long period of time. organisms in this category usually have a very large number of offspring, but once they are born, little parental care is provided. thus these offspring are on their own and vulnerable to predation, but their sheer numbers assure the survival of enough individuals to perpetuate the species. populations are individuals of a species that live in a particular habitat. ecologists measure characteristics of populations: size, density, dispersion pattern, age structure, and sex ratio. life tables are useful to calculate life expectancies of individual population members. survivorship curves show the number of individuals surviving at each age interval plotted versus time.","[('survivorship curve', 'survivorship curves'), ('species distribution', 'species distributions'), ('mark and recapture', 'mark and recaptures', 'marks and recapture', 'marks and recaptures'), ('population research', 'population research'), ('life table', 'life tables'), ('species distribution pattern', 'species distribution patterns', 'species distributions pattern', 'species distributions patterns', 'species distribution pattern', 'species distribution patterns', 'species distributions pattern', 'species distributions patterns'), ('mortality rate', 'mortality rates'), ('population density', 'population densities'), ('population distribution', 'population distributions'), ('population size', 'population sizes'), ('demography', 'demographies'), ('population ecology', 'population ecologies'), ('population demography', 'population demographies'), ('quadrat', 'quadrats')]"
238,stax-bio,45,Population and Community Ecology,2,m44881,Life HIstories and Natural Selection,"a species life history describes the series of events over its lifetime, such as how resources are allocated for growth, maintenance, and reproduction. life history traits affect the life table of an organism. a species life history is genetically determined and shaped by the environment and natural selection. energy is required by all living organisms for their growth, maintenance, and reproduction; at the same time, energy is often a major limiting factor in determining an organisms survival. plants, for example, acquire energy from the sun via photosynthesis, but must expend this energy to grow, maintain health, and produce energy-rich seeds to produce the next generation. animals have the additional burden of using some of their energy reserves to acquire food. furthermore, some animals must expend energy caring for their offspring. thus, all species have an energy budget: they must balance energy intake with their use of energy for metabolism, reproduction, parental care, and energy storage (such as bears building up body fat for winter hibernation). fecundity is the potential reproductive capacity of an individual within a population. in other words, fecundity describes how many offspring could ideally be produced if an individual has as many offspring as possible, repeating the reproductive cycle as soon as possible after the birth of the offspring. in animals, fecundity is inversely related to the amount of parental care given to an individual offspring. species, such as many marine invertebrates, that produce many offspring usually provide little if any care for the offspring (they would not have the energy or the ability to do so anyway). most of their energy budget is used to produce many tiny offspring. animals with this strategy are often self-sufficient at a very early age. this is because of the energy tradeoff these organisms have made to maximize their evolutionary fitness. because their energy is used for producing offspring instead of parental care, it makes sense that these offspring have some ability to be able to move within their environment and find food and perhaps shelter. even with these abilities, their small size makes them extremely vulnerable to predation, so the production of many offspring allows enough of them to survive to maintain the species. animal species that have few offspring during a reproductive event usually give extensive parental care, devoting much of their energy budget to these activities, sometimes at the expense of their own health. this is the case with many mammals, such as humans, kangaroos, and pandas. the offspring of these species are relatively helpless at birth and need to develop before they achieve self-sufficiency. plants with low fecundity produce few energy-rich seeds (such as coconuts and chestnuts) with each having a good chance to germinate into a new organism; plants with high fecundity usually have many small, energy-poor seeds (like orchids) that have a relatively poor chance of surviving. although it may seem that coconuts and chestnuts have a better chance of surviving, the energy tradeoff of the orchid is also very effective. it is a matter of where the energy is used, for large numbers of seeds or for fewer seeds with more energy. the timing of reproduction in a life history also affects species survival. organisms that reproduce at an early age have a greater chance of producing offspring, but this is usually at the expense of their growth and the maintenance of their health. conversely, organisms that start reproducing later in life often have greater fecundity or are better able to provide parental care, but they risk that they will not survive to reproductive age. examples of this can be seen in fishes. small fish like guppies use their energy to reproduce rapidly, but never attain the size that would give them defense against some predators. larger fish, like the bluegill or shark, use their energy to attain a large size, but do so with the risk that they will die before they can reproduce or at least reproduce to their maximum. these different energy strategies and tradeoffs are key to understanding the evolution of each species as it maximizes its fitness and fills its niche. in terms of energy budgeting, some species blow it all and use up most of their energy reserves to reproduce early before they die. other species delay having reproduction to become stronger, more experienced individuals and to make sure that they are strong enough to provide parental care if necessary. some life history traits, such as fecundity, timing of reproduction, and parental care, can be grouped together into general strategies that are used by multiple species. semelparity occurs when a species reproduces only once during its lifetime and then dies. such species use most of their resource budget during a single reproductive event, sacrificing their health to the point that they do not survive. examples of semelparity are bamboo, which flowers once and then dies, and the chinook salmon ([link]a), which uses most of its energy reserves to migrate from the ocean to its freshwater nesting area, where it reproduces and then dies. scientists have posited alternate explanations for the evolutionary advantage of the chinooks post-reproduction death: a programmed suicide caused by a massive release of corticosteroid hormones, presumably so the parents can become food for the offspring, or simple exhaustion caused by the energy demands of reproduction; these are still being debated. iteroparity describes species that reproduce repeatedly during their lives. some animals are able to mate only once per year, but survive multiple mating seasons. the pronghorn antelope is an example of an animal that goes into a seasonal estrus cycle (heat): a hormonally induced physiological condition preparing the body for successful mating ([link]b). females of these species mate only during the estrus phase of the cycle. a different pattern is observed in primates, including humans and chimpanzees, which may attempt reproduction at any time during their reproductive years, even though their menstrual cycles make pregnancy likely only a few days per month during ovulation ([link]c). energy budgets, reproductive costs, and sexual selection in drosophila
research into how animals allocate their energy resources for growth, maintenance, and reproduction has used a variety of experimental animal models. some of this work has been done using the common fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster. studies have shown that not only does reproduction have a cost as far as how long male fruit flies live, but also fruit flies that have already mated several times have limited sperm remaining for reproduction. fruit flies maximize their last chances at reproduction by selecting optimal mates. in a 1981 study, male fruit flies were placed in enclosures with either virgin or inseminated females. the males that mated with virgin females had shorter life spans than those in contact with the same number of inseminated females with which they were unable to mate. this effect occurred regardless of how large (indicative of their age) the males were. thus, males that did not mate lived longer, allowing them more opportunities to find mates in the future. more recent studies, performed in 2006, show how males select the female with which they will mate and how this is affected by previous matings ([link]).1 males were allowed to select between smaller and larger females. findings showed that larger females had greater fecundity, producing twice as many offspring per mating as the smaller females did. males that had previously mated, and thus had lower supplies of sperm, were termed resource-depleted, while males that had not mated were termed non-resource-depleted. the study showed that although non-resource-depleted males preferentially mated with larger females, this selection of partners was more pronounced in the resource-depleted males. thus, males with depleted sperm supplies, which were limited in the number of times that they could mate before they replenished their sperm supply, selected larger, more fecund females, thus maximizing their chances for offspring. this study was one of the first to show that the physiological state of the male affected its mating behavior in a way that clearly maximizes its use of limited reproductive resources. these studies demonstrate two ways in which the energy budget is a factor in reproduction. first, energy expended on mating may reduce an animals lifespan, but by this time they have already reproduced, so in the context of natural selection this early death is not of much evolutionary importance. second, when resources such as sperm (and the energy needed to replenish it) are low, an organisms behavior can change to give them the best chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. these changes in behavior, so important to evolution, are studied in a discipline known as behavioral biology, or ethology, at the interface between population biology and psychology. all species have evolved a pattern of living, called a life history strategy, in which they partition energy for growth, maintenance, and reproduction. these patterns evolve through natural selection; they allow species to adapt to their environment to obtain the resources they need to successfully reproduce. there is an inverse relationship between fecundity and parental care. a species may reproduce early in life to ensure surviving to a reproductive age or reproduce later in life to become larger and healthier and better able to give parental care. a species may reproduce once (semelparity) or many times (iteroparity) in its life.","[('energy budget', 'energy budgets'), ('life history pattern', 'life history patterns', 'life histories pattern', 'life histories patterns', 'lives history pattern', 'lives history patterns', 'lives histories pattern', 'lives histories patterns'), ('late reproduction', 'late reproductions'), ('semelparity', 'semelparities'), ('population ecology', 'population ecologies'), ('early reproduction', 'early reproductions'), ('parental care', 'parental cares'), ('fecundity', 'fecundities'), ('iteroparity', 'iteroparities')]"
239,stax-bio,45,Population and Community Ecology,3,m44872,Environmental Limits to Population Growth,"although life histories describe the way many characteristics of a population (such as their age structure) change over time in a general way, population ecologists make use of a variety of methods to model population dynamics mathematically. these more precise models can then be used to accurately describe changes occurring in a population and better predict future changes. certain models that have been accepted for decades are now being modified or even abandoned due to their lack of predictive ability, and scholars strive to create effective new models. charles darwin, in his theory of natural selection, was greatly influenced by the english clergyman thomas malthus. malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly, and then population growth decreases as resources become depleted. this accelerating pattern of increasing population size is called exponential growth. the best example of exponential growth is seen in bacteria. bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce by prokaryotic fission. this division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. if 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an unlimited supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become depleted), after an hour, there is one round of division and each organism divides, resulting in 2000 organismsan increase of 1000. in another hour, each of the 2000 organisms will double, producing 4000, an increase of 2000 organisms. after the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask, an increase of 4000 organisms. the important concept of exponential growth is that the population growth ratethe number of organisms added in each reproductive generationis accelerating; that is, it is increasing at a greater and greater rate. after 1 day and 24 of these cycles, the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion. when the population size, n, is plotted over time, a j-shaped growth curve is produced ([link]). the bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited. furthermore, some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce, lowering the growth rate. therefore, when calculating the growth rate of a population, the death rate (d) (number organisms that die during a particular time interval) is subtracted from the birth rate (b) (number organisms that are born during that interval). this is shown in the following formula: the birth rate is usually expressed on a per capita (for each individual) basis. thus, b (birth rate) = bn (the per capita birth rate b multiplied by the number of individuals n) and d (death rate) =dn (the per capita death rate d multiplied by the number of individuals n). additionally, ecologists are interested in the population at a particular point in time, an infinitely small time interval. for this reason, the terminology of differential calculus is used to obtain the instantaneous growth rate, replacing the change in number and time with an instant-specific measurement of number and time. notice that the d associated with the first term refers to the derivative (as the term is used in calculus) and is different from the death rate, also called d. the difference between birth and death rates is further simplified by substituting the term r (intrinsic rate of increase) for the relationship between birth and death rates: the value r can be positive, meaning the population is increasing in size; or negative, meaning the population is decreasing in size; or zero, where the populations size is unchanging, a condition known as zero population growth. a further refinement of the formula recognizes that different species have inherent differences in their intrinsic rate of increase (often thought of as the potential for reproduction), even under ideal conditions. obviously, a bacterium can reproduce more rapidly and have a higher intrinsic rate of growth than a human. the maximal growth rate for a species is its biotic potential, or rmax, thus changing the equation to: exponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world. charles darwin recognized this fact in his description of the struggle for existence, which states that individuals will compete (with members of their own or other species) for limited resources. the successful ones will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits (which we know now are transferred by genes) to the next generation at a greater rate (natural selection). to model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed the logistic growth model. in the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. exponential growth may occur in environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals gets large enough, resources will be depleted, slowing the growth rate. eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off ([link]). this population size, which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support, is called the carrying capacity, or k. the formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate. the expression k  n is indicative of how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage, and k  n divided by k is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth. thus, the exponential growth model is restricted by this factor to generate the logistic growth equation: notice that when n is very small, (k-n)/k becomes close to k/k or 1, and the right side of the equation reduces to rmaxn, which means the population is growing exponentially and is not influenced by carrying capacity. on the other hand, when n is large, (k-n)/k come close to zero, which means that population growth will be slowed greatly or even stopped. thus, population growth is greatly slowed in large populations by the carrying capacity k. this model also allows for the population of a negative population growth, or a population decline. this occurs when the number of individuals in the population exceeds the carrying capacity (because the value of (k-n)/k is negative). a graph of this equation yields an s-shaped curve ([link]), and it is a more realistic model of population growth than exponential growth. there are three different sections to an s-shaped curve. initially, growth is exponential because there are few individuals and ample resources available. then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases. finally, growth levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population size over time. the logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal chance for survival. for plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and the space to grow are the important resources, whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates. in the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others. the resulting competition between population members of the same species for resources is termed intraspecific competition (intra- = within; -specific = species). intraspecific competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacityresources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need. however, as population size increases, this competition intensifies. in addition, the accumulation of waste products can reduce an environments carrying capacity. yeast, a microscopic fungus used to make bread and alcoholic beverages, exhibits the classical s-shaped curve when grown in a test tube ([link]a). its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients that are necessary for its growth. in the real world, however, there are variations to this idealized curve. examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals ([link]b). in both examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below the carrying capacity afterwards. this fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the population oscillates around its carrying capacity. still, even with this oscillation, the logistic model is confirmed. populations with unlimited resources grow exponentially, with an accelerating growth rate. when resources become limiting, populations follow a logistic growth curve. the population of a species will level off at the carrying capacity of its environment.","[('exponential growth', 'exponential growths'), ('birth rate', 'birth rates'), ('s-shaped growth curve', 's-shaped growth curves'), ('death rate', 'death rates'), ('carrying capacity', 'carrying capacities'), ('biotic potential', 'biotic potentials'), ('j-shaped growth curve', 'j-shaped growth curves'), ('intraspecific competition', 'intraspecific competitions'), ('zero population growth', 'zero population growths', 'zero populations growth', 'zero populations growths'), ('logistic growth', 'logistic growths'), ('interspecific competition', 'interspecific competitions'), ('population ecology', 'population ecologies'), ('environmental adaptation', 'environmental adaptations')]"
240,stax-bio,45,Population and Community Ecology,4,m44882,Population Dynamics and Regulation,"the logistic model of population growth, while valid in many natural populations and a useful model, is a simplification of real-world population dynamics. implicit in the model is that the carrying capacity of the environment does not change, which is not the case. the carrying capacity varies annually: for example, some summers are hot and dry whereas others are cold and wet. in many areas, the carrying capacity during the winter is much lower than it is during the summer. also, natural events such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and fires can alter an environment and hence its carrying capacity. additionally, populations do not usually exist in isolation. they engage in interspecific competition: that is, they share the environment with other species, competing with them for the same resources. these factors are also important to understanding how a specific population will grow. nature regulates population growth in a variety of ways. these are grouped into density-dependent factors, in which the density of the population at a given time affects growth rate and mortality, and density-independent factors, which influence mortality in a population regardless of population density. note that in the former, the effect of the factor on the population depends on the density of the population at onset. conservation biologists want to understand both types because this helps them manage populations and prevent extinction or overpopulation. most density-dependent factors are biological in nature (biotic), and include predation, inter- and intraspecific competition, accumulation of waste, and diseases such as those caused by parasites. usually, the denser a population is, the greater its mortality rate. for example, during intra- and interspecific competition, the reproductive rates of the individuals will usually be lower, reducing their populations rate of growth. in addition, low prey density increases the mortality of its predator because it has more difficulty locating its food source. an example of density-dependent regulation is shown in [link] with results from a study focusing on the giant intestinal roundworm (ascaris lumbricoides), a parasite of humans and other mammals.1 denser populations of the parasite exhibited lower fecundity: they contained fewer eggs. one possible explanation for this is that females would be smaller in more dense populations (due to limited resources) and that smaller females would have fewer eggs. this hypothesis was tested and disproved in a 2009 study which showed that female weight had no influence.2 the actual cause of the density-dependence of fecundity in this organism is still unclear and awaiting further investigation. many factors, typically physical or chemical in nature (abiotic), influence the mortality of a population regardless of its density, including weather, natural disasters, and pollution. an individual deer may be killed in a forest fire regardless of how many deer happen to be in that area. its chances of survival are the same whether the population density is high or low. the same holds true for cold winter weather. in real-life situations, population regulation is very complicated and density-dependent and independent factors can interact. a dense population that is reduced in a density-independent manner by some environmental factor(s) will be able to recover differently than a sparse population. for example, a population of deer affected by a harsh winter will recover faster if there are more deer remaining to reproduce. why did the woolly mammoth go extinct?

 it's easy to get lost in the discussion of dinosaurs and theories about why they went extinct 65 million years ago. was it due to a meteor slamming into earth near the coast of modern-day mexico, or was it from some long-term weather cycle that is not yet understood? one hypothesis that will never be proposed is that humans had something to do with it. mammals were small, insignificant creatures of the forest 65 million years ago, and no humans existed. woolly mammoths, however, began to go extinct about 10,000 years ago, when they shared the earth with humans who were no different anatomically than humans today ([link]). mammoths survived in isolated island populations as recently as 1700 bc. we know a lot about these animals from carcasses found frozen in the ice of siberia and other regions of the north. scientists have sequenced at least 50 percent of its genome and believe mammoths are between 98 and 99 percent identical to modern elephants. it is commonly thought that climate change and human hunting led to their extinction. a 2008 study estimated that climate change reduced the mammoths range from 3,000,000 square miles 42,000 years ago to 310,000 square miles 6,000 years ago.4  it is also well documented that humans hunted these animals. a 2012 study showed that no single factor was exclusively responsible for the extinction of these magnificent creatures.5  in addition to human hunting, climate change, and reduction of habitat, these scientists demonstrated another important factor in the mammoths extinction was the migration of humans across the bering strait to north america during the last ice age 20,000 years ago. the maintenance of stable populations was and is very complex, with many interacting factors determining the outcome. it is important to remember that humans are also part of nature. once we contributed to a species decline using primitive hunting technology only. while reproductive strategies play a key role in life histories, they do not account for important factors like limited resources and competition. the regulation of population growth by these factors can be used to introduce a classical concept in population biology, that of k-selected versus r-selected species. by the second half of the twentieth century, the concept of k- and r-selected species was used extensively and successfully to study populations. the concept relates not only reproductive strategies, but also to a species habitat and behavior, especially in the way that they obtain resources and care for their young. it includes length of life and survivorship factors as well. for this analysis, population biologists have grouped species into the two large categoriesk-selected and r-selectedalthough they are really two ends of a continuum. k-selected species are species selected by stable, predictable environments. populations of k-selected species tend to exist close to their carrying capacity (hence the term k-selected) where intraspecific competition is high. these species have few, large offspring, a long gestation period, and often give long-term care to their offspring (table b450401). while larger in size when born, the offspring are relatively helpless and immature at birth. by the time they reach adulthood, they must develop skills to compete for natural resources. in plants, scientists think of parental care more broadly: how long fruit takes to develop or how long it remains on the plant are determining factors in the time to the next reproductive event. examples of k-selected species are primates including humans), elephants, and plants such as oak trees ([link]a). oak trees grow very slowly and take, on average, 20 years to produce their first seeds, known as acorns. as many as 50,000 acorns can be produced by an individual tree, but the germination rate is low as many of these rot or are eaten by animals such as squirrels. in some years, oaks may produce an exceptionally large number of acorns, and these years may be on a two- or three-year cycle depending on the species of oak (r-selection). as oak trees grow to a large size and for many years before they begin to produce acorns, they devote a large percentage of their energy budget to growth and maintenance. the trees height and size allow it to dominate other plants in the competition for sunlight, the oaks primary energy resource. furthermore, when it does reproduce, the oak produces large, energy-rich seeds that use their energy reserve to become quickly established (k-selection). in contrast, r-selected species  have a large number of small offspring (hence their r designation ([link]). this strategy is often employed in unpredictable or changing environments. animals that are r-selected do not give long-term parental care and the offspring are relatively mature and self-sufficient at birth. examples of r-selected species are marine invertebrates, such as jellyfish, and plants, such as the dandelion ([link]b). dandelions have small seeds that are wind dispersed long distances. many seeds are produced simultaneously to ensure that at least some of them reach a hospitable environment. seeds that land in inhospitable environments have little chance for survival since their seeds are low in energy content. note that survival is not necessarily a function of energy stored in the seed itself. the r- and k-selection theory, although accepted for decades and used for much groundbreaking research, has now been reconsidered, and many population biologists have abandoned or modified it. over the years, several studies attempted to confirm the theory, but these attempts have largely failed. many species were identified that did not follow the theorys predictions. furthermore, the theory ignored the age-specific mortality of the populations which scientists now know is very important. new demographic-based models of life history evolution have been developed which incorporate many ecological concepts included in r- and k-selection theory as well as population age structure and mortality factors. populations are regulated by a variety of density-dependent and density-independent factors. species are divided into two categories based on a variety of features of their life history patterns: r-selected species, which have large numbers of offspring, and k-selected species, which have few offspring. the r- and k-selection theory has fallen out of use; however, many of its key features are still used in newer, demographically-based models of population dynamics.","[('k-selected specy', 'k-selected species'), ('population dynamic', 'population dynamicss', 'population dynamics'), ('life history', 'life histories'), ('density-dependent regulation',

241,stax-bio,45,Population and Community Ecology,5,m44875,Human Population Growth,"concepts of animal population dynamics can be applied to human population growth. humans are not unique in their ability to alter their environment. for example, beaver dams alter the stream environment where they are built. humans, however, have the ability to alter their environment to increase its carrying capacity sometimes to the detriment of other species (e.g., via artificial selection for crops that have a higher yield). earths human population is growing rapidly, to the extent that some worry about the ability of the earths environment to sustain this population, as long-term exponential growth carries the potential risks of famine, disease, and large-scale death. although humans have increased the carrying capacity of their environment, the technologies used to achieve this transformation have caused unprecedented changes to earths environment, altering ecosystems to the point where some may be in danger of collapse. the depletion of the ozone layer, erosion due to acid rain, and damage from global climate change are caused by human activities. the ultimate effect of these changes on our carrying capacity is unknown. as some point out, it is likely that the negative effects of increasing carrying capacity will outweigh the positive onesthe carrying capacity of the world for human beings might actually decrease. the worlds human population is currently experiencing exponential growth even though human reproduction is far below its biotic potential ([link]). to reach its biotic potential, all females would have to become pregnant every nine months or so during their reproductive years. also, resources would have to be such that the environment would support such growth. neither of these two conditions exists. in spite of this fact, human population is still growing exponentially. a consequence of exponential human population growth is the time that it takes to add a particular number of humans to the earth is becoming shorter. [link] shows that 123 years were necessary to add 1 billion humans in 1930, but it only took 24 years to add two billion people between 1975 and 1999. as already discussed, at some point it would appear that our ability to increase our carrying capacity indefinitely on a finite world is uncertain. without new technological advances, the human growth rate has been predicted to slow in the coming decades. however, the population will still be increasing and the threat of overpopulation remains. humans are unique in their ability to alter their environment with the conscious purpose of increasing its carrying capacity. this ability is a major factor responsible for human population growth and a way of overcoming density-dependent growth regulation. much of this ability is related to human intelligence, society, and communication. humans can construct shelter to protect them from the elements and have developed agriculture and domesticated animals to increase their food supplies. in addition, humans use language to communicate this technology to new generations, allowing them to improve upon previous accomplishments. other factors in human population growth are migration and public health. humans originated in africa, but have since migrated to nearly all inhabitable land on the earth. public health, sanitation, and the use of antibiotics and vaccines have decreased the ability of infectious disease to limit human population growth. in the past, diseases such as the bubonic plaque of the fourteenth century killed between 30 and 60 percent of europes population and reduced the overall world population by as many as 100 million people. today, the threat of infectious disease, while not gone, is certainly less severe. according to the world health organization, global death from infectious disease declined from 16.4 million in 1993 to 14.7 million in 1992. to compare to some of the epidemics of the past, the percentage of the world's population killed between 1993 and 2002 decreased from 0.30 percent of the world's population to 0.24 percent. thus, it appears that the influence of infectious disease on human population growth is becoming less significant. the age structure of a population is an important factor in population dynamics. age structure is the proportion of a population at different age ranges. age structure allows better prediction of population growth, plus the ability to associate this growth with the level of economic development in the region. countries with rapid growth have a pyramidal shape in their age structure diagrams, showing a preponderance of younger individuals, many of whom are of reproductive age or will be soon ([link]). this pattern is most often observed in underdeveloped countries where individuals do not live to old age because of less-than-optimal living conditions. age structures of areas with slow growth, including developed countries such as the united states, still have a pyramidal structure, but with many fewer young and reproductive-aged individuals and a greater proportion of older individuals. other developed countries, such as italy, have zero population growth. the age structure of these populations is more conical, with an even greater percentage of middle-aged and older individuals. the actual growth rates in different countries are shown in [link], with the highest rates tending to be in the less economically developed countries of africa and asia. many dire predictions have been made about the worlds population leading to a major crisis called the population explosion. in the 1968 book the population bomb, biologist dr. paul r. ehrlich wrote, the battle to feed all of humanity is over. in the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. at this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.1 while many critics view this statement as an exaggeration, the laws of exponential population growth are still in effect, and unchecked human population growth cannot continue indefinitely. efforts to control population growth led to the one-child policy in china, which used to include more severe consequences, but now imposes fines on urban couples who have more than one child. due to the fact that some couples wish to have a male heir, many chinese couples continue to have more than one child. the policy itself, its social impacts, and the effectiveness of limiting overall population growth are controversial. in spite of population control policies, the human population continues to grow. at some point the food supply may run out because of the subsequent need to produce more and more food to feed our population. the united nations estimates that future world population growth may vary from 6 billion (a decrease) to 16 billion people by the year 2100. there is no way to know whether human population growth will moderate to the point where the crisis described by dr. ehrlich will be averted. another result of population growth is the endangerment of the natural environment. many countries have attempted to reduce the human impact on climate change by reducing their emission of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. however, these treaties have not been ratified by every country, and many underdeveloped countries trying to improve their economic condition may be less likely to agree with such provisions if it means slower economic development. furthermore, the role of human activity in causing climate change has become a hotly debated socio-political issue in some developed countries, including the united states. thus, we enter the future with considerable uncertainty about our ability to curb human population growth and protect our environment. the worlds human population is growing at an exponential rate. humans have increased the worlds carrying capacity through migration, agriculture, medical advances, and communication. the age structure of a population allows us to predict population growth. unchecked human population growth could have dire long-term effects on our environment.","[('human population growth', 'human population growths', 'human populations growth', 'human populations growths'), ('overpopulation', 'overpopulations'), ('human carrying capacity',

242,stax-bio,45,Population and Community Ecology,6,m44878,Community Ecology,"populations rarely, if ever, live in isolation from populations of other species. in most cases, numerous species share a habitat. the interactions between these populations play a major role in regulating population growth and abundance. all populations occupying the same habitat form a community: populations inhabiting a specific area at the same time. the number of species occupying the same habitat and their relative abundance is known as species diversity. areas with low diversity, such as the glaciers of antarctica, still contain a wide variety of living things, whereas the diversity of tropical rainforests is so great that it cannot be counted. ecology is studied at the community level to understand how species interact with each other and compete for the same resources. perhaps the classical example of species interaction is predation: the hunting of prey by its predator. nature shows on television highlight the drama of one living organism killing another. populations of predators and prey in a community are not constant over time: in most cases, they vary in cycles that appear to be related. the most often cited example of predator-prey dynamics is seen in the cycling of the lynx (predator) and the snowshoe hare (prey), using nearly 200 year-old trapping data from north american forests ([link]). this cycle of predator and prey lasts approximately 10 years, with the predator population lagging 12 years behind that of the prey population. as the hare numbers increase, there is more food available for the lynx, allowing the lynx population to increase as well. when the lynx population grows to a threshold level, however, they kill so many hares that hare population begins to decline, followed by a decline in the lynx population because of scarcity of food. when the lynx population is low, the hare population size begins to increase due, at least in part, to low predation pressure, starting the cycle anew. the idea that the population cycling of the two species is entirely controlled by predation models has come under question. more recent studies have pointed to undefined density-dependent factors as being important in the cycling, in addition to predation. one possibility is that the cycling is inherent in the hare population due to density-dependent effects such as lower fecundity (maternal stress) caused by crowding when the hare population gets too dense. the hare cycling would then induce the cycling of the lynx because it is the lynxes major food source. the more we study communities, the more complexities we find, allowing ecologists to derive more accurate and sophisticated models of population dynamics. herbivory describes the consumption of plants by insects and other animals, and it is another interspecific relationship that affects populations. unlike animals, most plants cannot outrun predators or use mimicry to hide from hungry animals. some plants have developed mechanisms to defend against herbivory. other species have developed mutualistic relationships; for example, herbivory provides a mechanism of seed distribution that aids in plant reproduction. the study of communities must consider evolutionary forces that act on the members of the various populations contained within it. species are not static, but slowly changing and adapting to their environment by natural selection and other evolutionary forces. species have evolved numerous mechanisms to escape predation and herbivory. these defenses may be mechanical, chemical, physical, or behavioral. mechanical defenses, such as the presence of thorns on plants or the hard shell on turtles, discourage animal predation and herbivory by causing physical pain to the predator or by physically preventing the predator from being able to eat the prey. chemical defenses are produced by many animals as well as plants, such as the foxglove which is extremely toxic when eaten. [link] shows some organisms defenses against predation and herbivory. many species use their body shape and coloration to avoid being detected by predators. the tropical walking stick is an insect with the coloration and body shape of a twig which makes it very hard to see when stationary against a background of real twigs ([link]a). in another example, the chameleon can change its color to match its surroundings ([link]b). both of these are examples of camouflage, or avoiding detection by blending in with the background. some species use coloration as a way of warning predators that they are not good to eat. for example, the cinnabar moth caterpillar, the fire-bellied toad, and many species of beetle have bright colors that warn of a foul taste, the presence of toxic chemical, and/or the ability to sting or bite, respectively. predators that ignore this coloration and eat the organisms will experience their unpleasant taste or presence of toxic chemicals and learn not to eat them in the future. this type of defensive mechanism is called aposematic coloration, or warning coloration ([link]). while some predators learn to avoid eating certain potential prey because of their coloration, other species have evolved mechanisms to mimic this coloration to avoid being eaten, even though they themselves may not be unpleasant to eat or contain toxic chemicals. in batesian mimicry, a harmless species imitates the warning coloration of a harmful one. assuming they share the same predators, this coloration then protects the harmless ones, even though they do not have the same level of physical or chemical defenses against predation as the organism they mimic. many insect species mimic the coloration of wasps or bees, which are stinging, venomous insects, thereby discouraging predation ([link]). in mllerian mimicry, multiple species share the same warning coloration, but all of them actually have defenses. [link] shows a variety of foul-tasting butterflies with similar coloration. in emsleyan/mertensian mimicry, a deadly prey mimics a less dangerous one, such as the venomous coral snake mimicking the non-venomous milk snake. this type of mimicry is extremely rare and more difficult to understand than the previous two types. for this type of mimicry to work, it is essential that eating the milk snake has unpleasant but not fatal consequences. then, these predators learn not to eat snakes with this coloration, protecting the coral snake as well. if the snake were fatal to the predator, there would be no opportunity for the predator to learn not to eat it, and the benefit for the less toxic species would disappear. resources are often limited within a habitat and multiple species may compete to obtain them. all species have an ecological niche in the ecosystem, which describes how they acquire the resources they need and how they interact with other species in the community. the competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot occupy the same niche in a habitat. in other words, different species cannot coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources. an example of this principle is shown in [link], with two protozoan species, paramecium aurelia and paramecium caudatum. when grown individually in the laboratory, they both thrive. but when they are placed together in the same test tube (habitat), p. aurelia outcompetes p. caudatum for food, leading to the latters eventual extinction. this exclusion may be avoided if a population evolves to make use of a different resource, a different area of the habitat, or feeds during a different time of day, called resource partitioning. the two organisms are then said to occupy different microniches. these organisms coexist by minimizing direct competition. symbiotic relationships, or symbioses (plural), are close interactions between individuals of different species over an extended period of time which impact the abundance and distribution of the associating populations. most scientists accept this definition, but some restrict the term to only those species that are mutualistic, where both individuals benefit from the interaction. in this discussion, the broader definition will be used. a commensal relationship occurs when one species benefits from the close, prolonged interaction, while the other neither benefits nor is harmed. birds nesting in trees provide an example of a commensal relationship ([link]). the tree is not harmed by the presence of the nest among its branches. the nests are light and produce little strain on the structural integrity of the branch, and most of the leaves, which the tree uses to get energy by photosynthesis, are above the nest so they are unaffected. the bird, on the other hand, benefits greatly. if the bird had to nest in the open, its eggs and young would be vulnerable to predators. another example of a commensal relationship is the clown fish and the sea anemone. the sea anemone is not harmed by the fish, and the fish benefits with protection from predators who would be stung upon nearing the sea anemone. a second type of symbiotic relationship is called mutualism, where two species benefit from their interaction. some scientists believe that these are the only true examples of symbiosis. for example, termites have a mutualistic relationship with protozoa that live in the insects gut ([link]a). the termite benefits from the ability of bacterial symbionts within the protozoa to digest cellulose. the termite itself cannot do this, and without the protozoa, it would not be able to obtain energy from its food (cellulose from the wood it chews and eats). the protozoa and the bacterial symbionts benefit by having a protective environment and a constant supply of food from the wood chewing actions of the termite. lichens have a mutualistic relationship between fungus and photosynthetic algae or bacteria ([link]b). as these symbionts grow together, the glucose produced by the algae provides nourishment for both organisms, whereas the physical structure of the lichen protects the algae from the elements and makes certain nutrients in the atmosphere more available to the algae. a parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living organism and derives nutrients from it. in this relationship, the parasite benefits, but the organism being fed upon, the host is harmed. the host is usually weakened by the parasite as it siphons resources the host would normally use to maintain itself. the parasite, however, is unlikely to kill the host, especially not quickly, because this would allow no time for the organism to complete its reproductive cycle by spreading to another host. the reproductive cycles of parasites are often very complex, sometimes requiring more than one host species. a tapeworm is a parasite that causes disease in humans when contaminated, undercooked meat such as pork, fish, or beef is consumed ([link]). the tapeworm can live inside the intestine of the host for several years, benefiting from the food the host is bringing into its gut by eating, and may grow to be over 50 ft long by adding segments. the parasite moves from species to species in a cycle, making two hosts necessary to complete its life cycle. another common parasite is plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan cause of malaria, a significant disease in many parts of the world. living in human liver and red blood cells, the organism reproduces asexually in the gut of blood-feeding mosquitoes to complete its life cycle. thus malaria is spread from human to human by mosquitoes, one of many arthropod-borne infectious diseases. communities are complex entities that can be characterized by their structure (the types and numbers of species present) and dynamics (how communities change over time). understanding community structure and dynamics enables community ecologists to manage ecosystems more effectively. foundation species are considered the base or bedrock of a community, having the greatest influence on its overall structure. they are usually the primary producers: organisms that bring most of the energy into the community. kelp, brown algae, is a foundation species, forming the basis of the kelp forests off the coast of california. foundation species may physically modify the environment to produce and maintain habitats that benefit the other organisms that use them. an example is the photosynthetic corals of the coral reef ([link]). corals themselves are not photosynthetic, but harbor symbionts within their body tissues (dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae) that perform photosynthesis; this is another example of a mutualism. the exoskeletons of living and dead coral make up most of the reef structure, which protects many other species from waves and ocean currents. biodiversity describes a communitys biological complexity: it is measured by the number of different species (species richness) in a particular area and their relative abundance (species evenness). the area in question could be a habitat, a biome, or the entire biosphere. species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat or biome. species richness varies across the globe ([link]). one factor in determining species richness is latitude, with the greatest species richness occurring in ecosystems near the equator, which often have warmer temperatures, large amounts of rainfall, and low seasonality. the lowest species richness occurs near the poles, which are much colder, drier, and thus less conducive to life in geologic time (time since glaciations). the predictability of climate or productivity is also an important factor. other factors influence species richness as well. for example, the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains, including the galpagos islands that inspired the young darwin. relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat, ecosystem, or biome. foundation species often have the highest relative abundance of species. a keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to upholding an ecological communitys structure. the intertidal sea star, pisaster ochraceus, of the northwestern united states is a keystone species ([link]). studies have shown that when this organism is removed from communities, populations of their natural prey (mussels) increase, completely altering the species composition and reducing biodiversity. another keystone species is the banded tetra, a fish in tropical streams, which supplies nearly all of the phosphorus, a necessary inorganic nutrient, to the rest of the community. if these fish were to become extinct, the community would be greatly affected. invasive speciesinvasive species are non-native organisms that, when introduced to an area out of their native range, threaten the ecosystem balance of that habitat. many such species exist in the united states, as shown in [link]. whether enjoying a forest hike, taking a summer boat trip, or simply walking down an urban street, you have likely encountered an invasive species. one of the many recent proliferations of an invasive species concerns the growth of asian carp populations. asian carp were introduced to the united states in the 1970s by fisheries and sewage treatment facilities that used the fishs excellent filter feeding capabilities to clean their ponds of excess plankton. some of the fish escaped, however, and by the 1980s they had colonized many waterways of the mississippi river basin, including the illinois and missouri rivers. voracious eaters and rapid reproducers, asian carp may outcompete native species for food, potentially leading to their extinction. for example, black carp are voracious eaters of native mussels and snails, limiting this food source for native fish species. silver carp eat plankton that native mussels and snails feed on, reducing this food source by a different alteration of the food web. in some areas of the mississippi river, asian carp species have become the most predominant, effectively outcompeting native fishes for habitat. in some parts of the illinois river, asian carp constitute 95 percent of the community's biomass. although edible, the fish is bony and not a desired food in the united states. moreover, their presence threatens the native fish and fisheries of the great lakes, which are important to local economies and recreational anglers. asian carp have even injured humans. the fish, frightened by the sound of approaching motorboats, thrust themselves into the air, often landing in the boat or directly hitting the boaters. the great lakes and their prized salmon and lake trout fisheries are also being threatened by these invasive fish. asian carp have already colonized rivers and canals that lead into lake michigan. one infested waterway of particular importance is the chicago sanitary and ship channel, the major supply waterway linking the great lakes to the mississippi river. to prevent the asian carp from leaving the canal, a series of electric barriers have been successfully used to discourage their migration; however, the threat is significant enough that several states and canada have sued to have the chicago channel permanently cut off from lake michigan. local and national politicians have weighed in on how to solve the problem, but no one knows whether the asian carp will ultimately be considered a nuisance, like other invasive species such as the water hyacinth and zebra mussel, or whether it will be the destroyer of the largest freshwater fishery of the world. the issues associated with asian carp show how population and community ecology, fisheries management, and politics intersect on issues of vital importance to the human food supply and economy. socio-political issues like this make extensive use of the sciences of population ecology (the study of members of a particular species occupying a particular area known as a habitat) and community ecology (the study of the interaction of all species within a habitat). community dynamics are the changes in community structure and composition over time. sometimes these changes are induced by environmental disturbances such as volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, fires, and climate change. communities with a stable structure are said to be at equilibrium. following a disturbance, the community may or may not return to the equilibrium state. succession describes the sequential appearance and disappearance of species in a community over time. in primary succession, newly exposed or newly formed land is colonized by living things; in secondary succession, part of an ecosystem is disturbed and remnants of the previous community remain. primary succession occurs when new land is formed or rock is exposed: for example, following the eruption of volcanoes, such as those on the big island of hawaii. as lava flows into the ocean, new land is continually being formed. on the big island, approximately 32 acres of land is added each year. first, weathering and other natural forces break down the substrate enough for the establishment of certain hearty plants and lichens with few soil requirements, known as pioneer species ([link]). these species help to further break down the mineral rich lava into soil where other, less hardy species will grow and eventually replace the pioneer species. in addition, as these early species grow and die, they add to an ever-growing layer of decomposing organic material and contribute to soil formation. over time the area will reach an equilibrium state, with a set of organisms quite different from the pioneer species. a classic example of secondary succession occurs in oak and hickory forests cleared by wildfire ([link]). wildfires will burn most vegetation and kill those animals unable to flee the area. their nutrients, however, are returned to the ground in the form of ash. thus, even when areas are devoid of life due to severe fires, the area will soon be ready for new life to take hold. before the fire, the vegetation was dominated by tall trees with access to the major plant energy resource: sunlight. their height gave them access to sunlight while also shading the ground and other low-lying species. after the fire, though, these trees are no longer dominant. thus, the first plants to grow back are usually annual plants followed within a few years by quickly growing and spreading grasses and other pioneer species. due to, at least in part, changes in the environment brought on by the growth of the grasses and other species, over many years, shrubs will emerge along with small pine, oak, and hickory trees. these organisms are called intermediate species. eventually, over 150 years, the forest will reach its equilibrium point where species composition is no longer changing and resembles the community before the fire. this equilibrium state is referred to as the climax community, which will remain stable until the next disturbance. communities include all the different species living in a given area. the variety of these species is called species richness. many organisms have developed defenses against predation and herbivory, including mechanical defenses, warning coloration, and mimicry, as a result of evolution and the interaction with other members of the community. two species cannot exist in the same habitat competing directly for the same resources. species may form symbiotic relationships such as commensalism or mutualism. community structure is described by its foundation and keystone species. communities respond to environmental disturbances by succession (the predictable appearance of different types of plant species) until a stable community structure is established.","[('parasitism', 'parasitisms'), ('defense mechanism', 'defense mechanisms'), ('community ecology', 'community ecologies'), ('competitive exclusion', 'competitive exclusions'), ('climax

243,stax-bio,45,Population and Community Ecology,7,m44879,Behavioral Biology: Proximate and Ultimate Causes of Behavior,"behavior is the change in activity of an organism in response to a stimulus. behavioral biology is the study of the biological and evolutionary bases for such changes. the idea that behaviors evolved as a result of the pressures of natural selection is not new. animal behavior has been studied for decades, by biologists in the science of ethology, by psychologists in the science of comparative psychology, and by scientists of many disciplines in the study of neurobiology. although there is overlap between these disciplines, scientists in these behavioral fields take different approaches. comparative psychology is an extension of work done in human and behavioral psychology. ethology is an extension of genetics, evolution, anatomy, physiology, and other biological disciplines. still, one cannot study behavioral biology without touching on both comparative psychology and ethology. one goal of behavioral biology is to dissect out the innate behaviors, which have a strong genetic component and are largely independent of environmental influences, from the learned behaviors, which result from environmental conditioning. innate behavior, or instinct, is important because there is no risk of an incorrect behavior being learned. they are hard wired into the system. on the other hand, learned behaviors, although riskier, are flexible, dynamic, and can be altered according to changes in the environment. innate or instinctual behaviors rely on response to stimuli. the simplest example of this is a reflex action, an involuntary and rapid response to stimulus. to test the knee-jerk reflex, a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a rubber hammer. the stimulation of the nerves there leads to the reflex of extending the leg at the knee. this is similar to the reaction of someone who touches a hot stove and instinctually pulls his or her hand away. even humans, with our great capacity to learn, still exhibit a variety of innate behaviors. another activity or movement of innate behavior is kinesis, or the undirected movement in response to a stimulus. orthokinesis is the increased or decreased speed of movement of an organism in response to a stimulus. woodlice, for example, increase their speed of movement when exposed to high or low temperatures. this movement, although random, increases the probability that the insect spends less time in the unfavorable environment. another example is klinokinesis, an increase in turning behaviors. it is exhibited by bacteria such as e. coli which, in association with orthokinesis, helps the organisms randomly find a more hospitable environment. a similar, but more directed version of kinesis is taxis: the directed movement towards or away from a stimulus. this movement can be in response to light (phototaxis), chemical signals (chemotaxis), or gravity (geotaxis) and can be directed toward (positive) or away (negative) from the source of the stimulus. an example of a positive chemotaxis is exhibited by the unicellular protozoan tetrahymena thermophila. this organism swims using its cilia, at times moving in a straight line, and at other times making turns. the attracting chemotactic agent alters the frequency of turning as the organism moves directly toward the source, following the increasing concentration gradient. a fixed action pattern is a series of movements elicited by a stimulus such that even when the stimulus is removed, the pattern goes on to completion. an example of such a behavior occurs in the three-spined stickleback, a small freshwater fish ([link]). males of this species develop a red belly during breeding season and show instinctual aggressiveness to other males during this time. in laboratory experiments, researchers exposed such fish to objects that in no way resemble a fish in their shape, but which were painted red on their lower halves. the male sticklebacks responded aggressively to the objects just as if they were real male sticklebacks. migration is the long-range seasonal movement of animals. it is an evolved, adapted response to variation in resource availability, and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals. birds fly south for the winter to get to warmer climates with sufficient food, and salmon migrate to their spawning grounds. the popular 2005 documentary march of the penguins followed the 62-mile migration of emperor penguins through antarctica to bring food back to their breeding site and to their young. wildebeests ([link]) migrate over 1800 miles each year in search of new grasslands. although migration is thought of as innate behavior, only some migrating species always migrate (obligate migration). animals that exhibit facultative migration can choose to migrate or not. additionally, in some animals, only a portion of the population migrates, whereas the rest does not migrate (incomplete migration). for example, owls that live in the tundra may migrate in years when their food source, small rodents, is relatively scarce, but not migrate during the years when rodents are plentiful. foraging is the act of searching for and exploiting food resources. feeding behaviors that maximize energy gain and minimize energy expenditure are called optimal foraging behaviors, and these are favored by natural section. the painted stork, for example, uses its long beak to search the bottom of a freshwater marshland for crabs and other food ([link]). not all animals live in groups, but even those that live relatively solitary lives, with the exception of those that can reproduce asexually, must mate. mating usually involves one animal signaling another so as to communicate the desire to mate. there are several types of energy-intensive behaviors or displays associated with mating, called mating rituals. other behaviors found in populations that live in groups are described in terms of which animal benefits from the behavior. in selfish behavior, only the animal in question benefits; in altruistic behavior, one animals actions benefit another animal; cooperative behavior describes when both animals benefit. all of these behaviors involve some sort of communication between population members. animals communicate with each other using stimuli known as signals. an example of this is seen in the three-spined stickleback, where the visual signal of a red region in the lower half of a fish signals males to become aggressive and signals females to mate. other signals are chemical (pheromones), aural (sound), visual (courtship and aggressive displays), or tactile (touch). these types of communication may be instinctual or learned or a combination of both. these are not the same as the communication we associate with language, which has been observed only in humans and perhaps in some species of primates and cetaceans. a pheromone is a secreted chemical signal used to obtain a response from another individual of the same species. the purpose of pheromones is to elicit a specific behavior from the receiving individual. pheromones are especially common among social insects, but they are used by many species to attract the opposite sex, to sound alarms, to mark food trails, and to elicit other, more complex behaviors. even humans are thought to respond to certain pheromones called axillary steroids. these chemicals influence human perception of other people, and in one study were responsible for a group of women synchronizing their menstrual cycles. the role of pheromones in human-to-human communication is still somewhat controversial and continues to be researched. songs are an example of an aural signal, one that needs to be heard by the recipient. perhaps the best known of these are songs of birds, which identify the species and are used to attract mates. other well-known songs are those of whales, which are of such low frequency that they can travel long distances underwater. dolphins communicate with each other using a wide variety of vocalizations. male crickets make chirping sounds using a specialized organ to attract a mate, repel other males, and to announce a successful mating. courtship displays are a series of ritualized visual behaviors (signals) designed to attract and convince a member of the opposite sex to mate. these displays are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. often these displays involve a series of steps, including an initial display by one member followed by a response from the other. if at any point, the display is performed incorrectly or a proper response is not given, the mating ritual is abandoned and the mating attempt will be unsuccessful. the mating display of the common stork is shown in [link]. aggressive displays are also common in the animal kingdom. an example is when a dog bares its teeth when it wants another dog to back down. presumably, these displays communicate not only the willingness of the animal to fight, but also its fighting ability. although these displays do signal aggression on the part of the sender, it is thought that these displays are actually a mechanism to reduce the amount of actual fighting that occurs between members of the same species: they allow individuals to assess the fighting ability of their opponent and thus decide whether it is worth the fight. the testing of certain hypotheses using game theory has led to the conclusion that some of these displays may overstate an animals actual fighting ability and are used to bluff the opponent. this type of interaction, even if dishonest, would be favored by natural selection if it is successful more times than not. distraction displays are seen in birds and some fish. they are designed to attract a predator away from the nest that contains their young. this is an example of an altruistic behavior: it benefits the young more than the individual performing the display, which is putting itself at risk by doing so. many animals, especially primates, communicate with other members in the group through touch. activities such as grooming, touching the shoulder or root of the tail, embracing, lip contact, and greeting ceremonies have all been observed in the indian langur, an old world monkey. similar behaviors are found in other primates, especially in the great apes. the killdeer bird distracts predators from its eggs by faking a broken wing display in this video taken in boise, idaho.

 behaviors that lower the fitness of the individual but increase the fitness of another individual are termed altruistic. examples of such behaviors are seen widely across the animal kingdom. social insects such as worker bees have no ability to reproduce, yet they maintain the queen so she can populate the hive with her offspring. meerkats keep a sentry standing guard to warn the rest of the colony about intruders, even though the sentry is putting itself at risk. wolves and wild dogs bring meat to pack members not present during a hunt. lemurs take care of infants unrelated to them. although on the surface, these behaviors appear to be altruistic, it may not be so simple. there has been much discussion over why altruistic behaviors exist. do these behaviors lead to overall evolutionary advantages for their species? do they help the altruistic individual pass on its own genes? and what about such activities between unrelated individuals? one explanation for altruistic-type behaviors is found in the genetics of natural selection. in the 1976 book, the selfish gene, scientist richard dawkins attempted to explain many seemingly altruistic behaviors from the viewpoint of the gene itself. although a gene obviously cannot be selfish in the human sense, it may appear that way if the sacrifice of an individual benefits related individuals that share genes that are identical by descent (present in relatives because of common lineage). mammal parents make this sacrifice to take care of their offspring. emperor penguins migrate miles in harsh conditions to bring food back for their young. selfish gene theory has been controversial over the years and is still discussed among scientists in related fields. even less-related individuals, those with less genetic identity than that shared by parent and offspring, benefit from seemingly altruistic behavior. the activities of social insects such as bees, wasps, ants, and termites are good examples. sterile workers in these societies take care of the queen because they are closely related to it, and as the queen has offspring, she is passing on genes from the workers indirectly. thus, it is of fitness benefit for the worker to maintain the queen without having any direct chance of passing on its genes due to its sterility. the lowering of individual fitness to enhance the reproductive fitness of a relative and thus ones inclusive fitness evolves through kin selection. this phenomenon can explain many superficially altruistic behaviors seen in animals. however, these behaviors may not be truly defined as altruism in these cases because the actor is actually increasing its own fitness either directly (through its own offspring) or indirectly (through the inclusive fitness it gains through relatives that share genes with it). unrelated individuals may also act altruistically to each other, and this seems to defy the selfish gene explanation. an example of this observed in many monkey species where a monkey will present its back to an unrelated monkey to have that individual pick the parasites from its fur. after a certain amount of time, the roles are reversed and the first monkey now grooms the second monkey. thus, there is reciprocity in the behavior. both benefit from the interaction and their fitness is raised more than if neither cooperated nor if one cooperated and the other did not cooperate. this behavior is still not necessarily altruism, as the giving behavior of the actor is based on the expectation that it will be the receiver of the behavior in the future, termed reciprocal altruism. reciprocal altruism requires that individuals repeatedly encounter each other, often the result of living in the same social group, and that cheaters (those that never give back) are punished. evolutionary game theory, a modification of classical game theory in mathematics, has shown that many of these so-called altruistic behaviors are not altruistic at all. the definition of pure altruism, based on human behavior, is an action that benefits another without any direct benefit to oneself. most of the behaviors previously described do not seem to satisfy this definition, and game theorists are good at finding selfish components in them. others have argued that the terms selfish and altruistic should be dropped completely when discussing animal behavior, as they describe human behavior and may not be directly applicable to instinctual animal activity. what is clear, though, is that heritable behaviors that improve the chances of passing on ones genes or a portion of ones genes are favored by natural selection and will be retained in future generations as long as those behaviors convey a fitness advantage. these instinctual behaviors may then be applied, in special circumstances, to other species, as long as it doesnt lower the animals fitness. not all animals reproduce sexually, but many that do have the same challenge: they need to find a suitable mate and often have to compete with other individuals to obtain one. significant energy is spent in the process of locating, attracting, and mating with the sex partner. two types of selection occur during this process and can lead to traits that are important to reproduction called secondary sexual characteristics: intersexual selection, the choosing of a mate where individuals of one sex choose mates of the other sex, and intrasexual selection, the competition for mates between species members of the same sex. intersexual selection is often complex because choosing a mate may be based on a variety of visual, aural, tactile, and chemical cues. an example of intersexual selection is when female peacocks choose to mate with the male with the brightest plumage. this type of selection often leads to traits in the chosen sex that do not enhance survival, but are those traits most attractive to the opposite sex (often at the expense of survival). intrasexual selection involves mating displays and aggressive mating rituals such as rams butting headsthe winner of these battles is the one that is able to mate. many of these rituals use up considerable energy but result in the selection of the healthiest, strongest, and/or most dominant individuals for mating. three general mating systems, all involving innate as opposed to learned behaviors, are seen in animal populations: monogamous, polygynous, and polyandrous. in monogamous systems, one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season. in some animals, such as the gray wolf, these associations can last much longer, even a lifetime. several explanations have been proposed for this type of mating system. the mate-guarding hypothesis states that males stay with the female to prevent other males from mating with her. this behavior is advantageous in such situations where mates are scarce and difficult to find. another explanation is the male-assistance hypothesis, where males that remain with a female to help guard and rear their young will have more and healthier offspring. monogamy is observed in many bird populations where, in addition to the parental care from the female, the male is also a major provider of parental care for the chicks. a third explanation for the evolutionary advantages of monogamy is the female-enforcement hypothesis. in this scenario, the female ensures that the male does not have other offspring that might compete with her own, so she actively interferes with the males signaling to attract other mates. polygynous mating refers to one male mating with multiple females. in these situations, the female must be responsible for most of the parental care as the single male is not capable of providing care to that many offspring. in resourced-based polygyny, males compete for territories with the best resources, and then mate with females that enter the territory, drawn to its resource richness. the female benefits by mating with a dominant, genetically fit male; however, it is at the cost of having no male help in caring for the offspring. an example is seen in the yellow-rumped honeyguide, a bird whose males defend beehives because the females feed on their wax. as the females approach, the male defending the nest will mate with them. harem mating structures are a type of polygynous system where certain males dominate mating while controlling a territory with resources. elephant seals, where the alpha male dominates the mating within the group are an example. a third type of polygyny is a lek system. here there is a communal courting area where several males perform elaborate displays for females, and the females choose their mate from this group. this behavior is observed in several bird species including the sage grouse and the prairie chicken. in polyandrous mating systems, one female mates with many males. these types of systems are much rarer than monogamous and polygynous mating systems. in pipefishes and seahorses, males receive the eggs from the female, fertilize them, protect them within a pouch, and give birth to the offspring ([link]). therefore, the female is able to provide eggs to several males without the burden of carrying the fertilized eggs. the majority of the behaviors previously discussed were innate or at least have an innate component (variations on the innate behaviors may be learned). they are inherited and the behaviors do not change in response to signals from the environment. conversely, learned behaviors, even though they may have instinctive components, allow an organism to adapt to changes in the environment and are modified by previous experiences. simple learned behaviors include habituation and imprintingboth are important to the maturation process of young animals. habituation is a simple form of learning in which an animal stops responding to a stimulus after a period of repeated exposure. this is a form of non-associative learning, as the stimulus is not associated with any punishment or reward. prairie dogs typically sound an alarm call when threatened by a predator, but they become habituated to the sound of human footsteps when no harm is associated with this sound, therefore, they no longer respond to them with an alarm call. in this example, habituation is specific to the sound of human footsteps, as the animals still respond to the sounds of potential predators. imprinting is a type of learning that occurs at a particular age or a life stage that is rapid and independent of the species involved. hatchling ducks recognize the first adult they see, their mother, and make a bond with her. a familiar sight is ducklings walking or swimming after their mothers ([link]). this is another type of non-associative learning, but is very important in the maturation process of these animals as it encourages them to stay near their mother so they will be protected, greatly increasing their chances of survival. however, if newborn ducks see a human before they see their mother, they will imprint on the human and follow it in just the same manner as they would follow their real mother. the international crane foundation has helped raise the worlds population of whooping cranes from 21 individuals to about 600. imprinting hatchlings has been a key to success: biologists wear full crane costumes so the birds never see humans. watch this video to learn more.

 conditioned behaviors are types of associative learning, where a stimulus becomes associated with a consequence. during operant conditioning, the behavioral response is modified by its consequences, with regards to its form, strength, or frequency. in classical conditioning, a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously not been associated with, the conditioned stimulus. the response to the original, unconditioned stimulus is called the unconditioned response. the most cited example of classical conditioning is ivan pavlovs experiments with dogs ([link]). in pavlovs experiments, the unconditioned response was the salivation of dogs in response to the unconditioned stimulus of seeing or smelling their food. the conditioning stimulus that researchers associated with the unconditioned response was the ringing of a bell. during conditioning, every time the animal was given food, the bell was rung. this was repeated during several trials. after some time, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food and to respond by salivating. after the conditioning period was finished, the dog would respond by salivating when the bell was rung, even when the unconditioned stimulus, the food, was absent. thus, the ringing of the bell became the conditioned stimulus and the salivation became the conditioned response. although it is thought by some scientists that the unconditioned and conditioned responses are identical, even pavlov discovered that the saliva in the conditioned dogs had characteristic differences when compared to the unconditioned dog. it had been thought by some scientists that this type of conditioning required multiple exposures to the paired stimulus and response, but it is now known that this is not necessary in all cases, and that some conditioning can be learned in a single pairing experiment. classical conditioning is a major tenet of behaviorism, a branch of psychological philosophy that proposes that all actions, thoughts, and emotions of living things are behaviors that can be treated by behavior modification and changes in the environment. in operant conditioning, the conditioned behavior is gradually modified by its consequences as the animal responds to the stimulus. a major proponent of such conditioning was psychologist b.f. skinner, the inventor of the skinner box. skinner put rats in his boxes that contained a lever that would dispense food to the rat when depressed. while initially the rat would push the lever a few times by accident, it eventually associated pushing the lever with getting the food. this type of learning is an example of operant conditioning. operant learning is the basis of most animal training. the conditioned behavior is continually modified by positive or negative reinforcement, often a reward such as food or some type of punishment, respectively. in this way, the animal is conditioned to associate a type of behavior with the punishment or reward, and, over time, can be induced to perform behaviors that they would not have done in the wild, such as the tricks dolphins perform at marine amusement park shows ([link]). classical and operant conditioning are inefficient ways for humans and other intelligent animals to learn. some primates, including humans, are able to learn by imitating the behavior of others and by taking instructions. the development of complex language by humans has made cognitive learning, the manipulation of information using the mind, the most prominent method of human learning. in fact, that is how students are learning right now by reading this book. as students read, they can make mental images of objects or organisms and imagine changes to them, or behaviors by them, and anticipate the consequences. in addition to visual processing, cognitive learning is also enhanced by remembering past experiences, touching physical objects, hearing sounds, tasting food, and a variety of other sensory-based inputs. cognitive learning is so powerful that it can be used to understand conditioning in detail. in the reverse scenario, conditioning cannot help someone learn about cognition. classic work on cognitive learning was done by wolfgang khler with chimpanzees. he demonstrated that these animals were capable of abstract thought by showing that they could learn how to solve a puzzle. when a banana was hung in their cage too high for them to reach, and several boxes were placed randomly on the floor, some of the chimps were able to stack the boxes one on top of the other, climb on top of them, and get the banana. this implies that they could visualize the result of stacking the boxes even before they had performed the action. this type of learning is much more powerful and versatile than conditioning. cognitive learning is not limited to primates, although they are the most efficient in using it. maze running experiments done with rats by h.c. blodgett in the 1920s were the first to show cognitive skills in a simple mammal. the motivation for the animals to work their way through the maze was a piece of food at its end. in these studies, the animals in group i were run in one trial per day and had food available to them each day on completion of the run ([link]). group ii rats were not fed in the maze for the first six days and then subsequent runs were done with food for several days after. group iii rats had food available on the third day and every day thereafter. the results were that the control rats, group i, learned quickly, and figured out how to run the maze in seven days. group iii did not learn much during the three days without food, but rapidly caught up to the control group when given the food reward. group ii learned very slowly for the six days with no reward to motivate them, and they did not begin to catch up to the control group until the day food was given, and then it took two days longer to learn the maze. it may not be immediately obvious that this type of learning is different than conditioning. although one might be tempted to believe that the rats simply learned how to find their way through a conditioned series of right and left turns, e.c. tolman proved a decade later that the rats were making a representation of the maze in their minds, which he called a cognitive map. this was an early demonstration of the power of cognitive learning and how these abilities were not just limited to humans. sociobiology is an interdisciplinary science originally popularized by social insect researcher e.o. wilson in the 1970s. wilson defined the science as the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization.1the main thrust of sociobiology is that animal and human behavior, including aggressiveness and other social interactions, can be explained almost solely in terms of genetics and natural selection. this science is controversial; noted scientist such as the late stephen jay gould criticized the approach for ignoring the environmental effects on behavior. this is another example of the nature versus nurture debate of the role of genetics versus the role of environment in determining an organisms characteristics. sociobiology also links genes with behaviors and has been associated with biological determinism, the belief that all behaviors are hardwired into our genes. no one disputes that certain behaviors can be inherited and that natural selection plays a role retaining them. it is the application of such principles to human behavior that sparks this controversy, which remains active today. behaviors are responses to stimuli. they can either be instinctual/innate behaviors, which are not influenced by the environment, or learned behaviors, which are influenced by environmental changes. instinctual behaviors include mating systems and methods of communication. learned behaviors include imprinting and habituation, conditioning, and, most powerfully, cognitive learning. although the connection between behavior, genetics, and evolution is well established, the explanation of human behavior as entirely genetic is controversial.","[('polyandry', 'polyandries'), ('behavioral biology', 'behavioral biologies'), ('courtship display', 'courtship displays'), ('polygyny', 'polygynies'),

244,stax-bio,46,Ecosystems,0,m44883,Introduction,"in 1993, an interesting example of ecosystem dynamics occurred when a rare lung disease struck inhabitants of the southwestern united states. this disease had an alarming rate of fatalities, killing more than half of early patients, many of whom were native americans. these formerly healthy young adults died from complete respiratory failure. the disease was unknown, and the centers for disease control (cdc), the united states government agency responsible for managing potential epidemics, was brought in to investigate. the scientists could have learned about the disease had they known to talk with the navajo healers who lived in the area and who had observed the connection between rainfall and mice populations, thereby predicting the 1993 outbreak. the cause of the disease, determined within a few weeks by the cdc investigators, was the hantavirus known as sin nombre, the virus with no name. with insights from traditional navajo medicine, scientists were able to characterize the disease rapidly and institute effective health measures to prevent its spread. this example illustrates the importance of understanding the complexities of ecosystems and how they respond to changes in the environment.","[('chemoautotroph', 'chemoautotrophs'), ('simulation model', 'simulation models'), ('carbon cycle', 'carbon cycles'),

245,stax-bio,46,Ecosystems,1,m44885,Ecology of Ecosystems,"life in an ecosystem is often about competition for limited resources, a characteristic of the theory of natural selection. competition in communities (all living things within specific habitats) is observed both within species and among different species. the resources for which organisms compete include organic material from living or previously living organisms, sunlight, and mineral nutrients, which provide the energy for living processes and the matter to make up organisms physical structures. other critical factors influencing community dynamics are the components of its physical and geographic environment: a habitats latitude, amount of rainfall, topography (elevation), and available species. these are all important environmental variables that determine which organisms can exist within a particular area. an ecosystem is a community of living organisms and their interactions with their abiotic (non-living) environment. ecosystems can be small, such as the tide pools found near the rocky shores of many oceans, or large, such as the amazon rainforest in brazil ([link]). there are three broad categories of ecosystems based on their general environment: freshwater, ocean water, and terrestrial. within these broad categories are individual ecosystem types based on the organisms present and the type of environmental habitat. ocean ecosystems are the most common, comprising 75 percent of the earth's surface and consisting of three basic types: shallow ocean, deep ocean water, and deep ocean surfaces (the low depth areas of the deep oceans). the shallow ocean ecosystems include extremely biodiverse coral reef ecosystems, and the deep ocean surface is known for its large numbers of plankton and krill (small crustaceans) that support it. these two environments are especially important to aerobic respirators worldwide as the phytoplankton perform 40 percent of all photosynthesis on earth. although not as diverse as the other two, deep ocean ecosystems contain a wide variety of marine organisms. such ecosystems exist even at the bottom of the ocean where light is unable to penetrate through the water. freshwater ecosystems are the rarest, occurring on only 1.8 percent of the earth's surface. lakes, rivers, streams, and springs comprise these systems; they are quite diverse, and they support a variety of fish, amphibians, reptiles, insects, phytoplankton, fungi, and bacteria. terrestrial ecosystems, also known for their diversity, are grouped into large categories called biomes, such as tropical rain forests, savannas, deserts, coniferous forests, deciduous forests, and tundra. grouping these ecosystems into just a few biome categories obscures the great diversity of the individual ecosystems within them. for example, there is great variation in desert vegetation: the saguaro cacti and other plant life in the sonoran desert, in the united states, are relatively abundant compared to the desolate rocky desert of boa vista, an island off the coast of western africa ([link]). ecosystems are complex with many interacting parts. they are routinely exposed to various disturbances, or changes in the environment that effect their compositions: yearly variations in rainfall and temperature and the slower processes of plant growth, which may take several years. many of these disturbances are a result of natural processes. for example, when lightning causes a forest fire and destroys part of a forest ecosystem, the ground is eventually populated by grasses, then by bushes and shrubs, and later by mature trees, restoring the forest to its former state. the impact of environmental disturbances caused by human activities is as important as the changes wrought by natural processes. human agricultural practices, air pollution, acid rain, global deforestation, overfishing, eutrophication, oil spills, and illegal dumping on land and into the ocean are all issues of concern to conservationists. equilibrium is the steady state of an ecosystem where all organisms are in balance with their environment and with each other. in ecology, two parameters are used to measure changes in ecosystems: resistance and resilience. the ability of an ecosystem to remain at equilibrium in spite of disturbances is called resistance. the speed at which an ecosystem recovers equilibrium after being disturbed, called its resilience. ecosystem resistance and resilience are especially important when considering human impact. the nature of an ecosystem may change to such a degree that it can lose its resilience entirely. this process can lead to the complete destruction or irreversible altering of the ecosystem. the term food chain is sometimes used metaphorically to describe human social situations. in this sense, food chains are thought of as a competition for survival, such as who eats whom? someone eats and someone is eaten. therefore, it is not surprising that in our competitive  dog-eat-dog society, individuals who are considered successful are seen as being at the top of the food chain, consuming all others for their benefit, whereas the less successful are seen as being at the bottom. the scientific understanding of a food chain is more precise than in its everyday usage. in ecology, a food chain is a linear sequence of organisms through which nutrients and energy pass: primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level consumers are used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics. there is a single path through the chain. each organism in a food chain occupies what is called a trophic level. depending on their role as producers or consumers, species or groups of species can be assigned to various trophic levels. in many ecosystems, the bottom of the food chain consists of photosynthetic organisms (plants and/or phytoplankton), which are called primary producers. the organisms that consume the primary producers are herbivores: the primary consumers. secondary consumers are usually carnivores that eat the primary consumers. tertiary consumers are carnivores that eat other carnivores. higher-level consumers feed on the next lower tropic levels, and so on, up to the organisms at the top of the food chain: the apex consumers. in the lake ontario food chain shown in [link], the chinook salmon is the apex consumer at the top of this food chain. one major factor that limits the length of food chains is energy. energy is lost as heat between each trophic level due to the second law of thermodynamics. thus, after a limited number of trophic energy transfers, the amount of energy remaining in the food chain may not be great enough to support viable populations at yet a higher trophic level. the loss of energy between trophic levels is illustrated by the pioneering studies of howard t. odum in the silver springs, florida, ecosystem in the 1940s ([link]). the primary producers generated 20,819 kcal/m2/yr (kilocalories per square meter per year), the primary consumers generated 3368 kcal/m2/yr, the secondary consumers generated 383 kcal/m2/yr, and the tertiary consumers only generated 21 kcal/m2/yr. thus, there is little energy remaining for another level of consumers in this ecosystem. there is a one problem when using food chains to accurately describe most ecosystems. even when all organisms are grouped into appropriate trophic levels, some of these organisms can feed on species from more than one trophic level; likewise, some of these organisms can be eaten by species from multiple trophic levels. in other words, the linear model of ecosystems, the food chain, is not completely descriptive of ecosystem structure. 	a holistic modelwhich accounts for all the interactions between different species and their complex interconnected relationships with each other and with the environmentis a more accurate and descriptive model for ecosystems. a food web is a graphic representation of a holistic, non-linear web of primary producers, primary consumers, and higher-level consumers used to describe ecosystem structure and dynamics ([link]). a comparison of the two types of structural ecosystem models shows strength in both. food chains are more flexible for analytical modeling, are easier to follow, and are easier to experiment with, whereas food web models more accurately represent ecosystem structure and dynamics, and data can be directly used as input for simulation modeling. two general types of food webs are often shown interacting within a single ecosystem. a grazing food web (such as the lake ontario food web in [link]) has plants or other photosynthetic organisms at its base, followed by herbivores and various carnivores. a detrital food web consists of a base of organisms that feed on decaying organic matter (dead organisms), called decomposers or detritivores. these organisms are usually bacteria or fungi that recycle organic material back into the biotic part of the ecosystem as they themselves are consumed by other organisms. as all ecosystems require a method to recycle material from dead organisms, most grazing food webs have an associated detrital food web. for example, in a meadow ecosystem, plants may support a grazing food web of different organisms, primary and other levels of consumers, while at the same time supporting a detrital food web of bacteria, fungi, and detrivorous invertebrates feeding off dead plants and animals. three-spined sticklebackit is well established by the theory of natural selection that changes in the environment play a major role in the evolution of species within an ecosystem. however, little is known about how the evolution of species within an ecosystem can alter the ecosystem environment. in 2009, dr. luke harmon, from the university of idaho in moscow, published a paper that for the first time showed that the evolution of organisms into subspecies can have direct effects on their ecosystem environment.1 the three-spines stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus) is a freshwater fish that evolved from a saltwater fish to live in freshwater lakes about 10,000 years ago, which is considered a recent development in evolutionary time ([link]). over the last 10,000 years, these freshwater fish then became isolated from each other in different lakes. depending on which lake population was studied, findings showed that these sticklebacks then either remained as one species or evolved into two species. the divergence of species was made possible by their use of different areas of the pond for feeding called micro niches. dr. harmon and his team created artificial pond microcosms in 250-gallon tanks and added muck from freshwater ponds as a source of zooplankton and other invertebrates to sustain the fish. in different experimental tanks they introduced one species of stickleback from either a single-species or double-species lake. over time, the team observed that some of the tanks bloomed with algae while others did not. this puzzled the scientists, and they decided to measure the water's dissolved organic carbon (doc), which consists of mostly large molecules of decaying organic matter that give pond-water its slightly brownish color. it turned out that the water from the tanks with two-species fish contained larger particles of doc (and hence darker water) than water with single-species fish. this increase in doc blocked the sunlight and prevented algal blooming. conversely, the water from the single-species tank contained smaller doc particles, allowing more sunlight penetration to fuel the algal blooms. this change in the environment, which is due to the different feeding habits of the stickleback species in each lake type, probably has a great impact on the survival of other species in these ecosystems, especially other photosynthetic organisms. thus, the study shows that, at least in these ecosystems, the environment and the evolution of populations have reciprocal effects that may now be factored into simulation models. the study of the changes in ecosystem structure caused by changes in the environment (disturbances) or by internal forces is called ecosystem dynamics. ecosystems are characterized using a variety of research methodologies. some ecologists study ecosystems using controlled experimental systems, while some study entire ecosystems in their natural state, and others use both approaches. a holistic ecosystem model attempts to quantify the composition, interaction, and dynamics of entire ecosystems; it is the most representative of the ecosystem in its natural state. a food web is an example of a holistic ecosystem model. however, this type of study is limited by time and expense, as well as the fact that it is neither feasible nor ethical to do experiments on large natural ecosystems. to quantify all different species in an ecosystem and the dynamics in their habitat is difficult, especially when studying large habitats such as the amazon rainforest, which covers 1.4 billion acres (5.5 million km2) of the earths surface. for these reasons, scientists study ecosystems under more controlled conditions. experimental systems usually involve either partitioning a part of a natural ecosystem that can be used for experiments, termed a mesocosm, or by re-creating an ecosystem entirely in an indoor or outdoor laboratory environment, which is referred to as a microcosm. a major limitation to these approaches is that removing individual organisms from their natural ecosystem or altering a natural ecosystem through partitioning may change the dynamics of the ecosystem. these changes are often due to differences in species numbers and diversity and also to environment alterations caused by partitioning (mesocosm) or re-creating (microcosm) the natural habitat. thus, these types of experiments are not totally predictive of changes that would occur in the ecosystem from which they were gathered. as both of these approaches have their limitations, some ecologists suggest that results from these experimental systems should be used only in conjunction with holistic ecosystem studies to obtain the most representative data about ecosystem structure, function, and dynamics. scientists use the data generated by these experimental studies to develop ecosystem models that demonstrate the structure and dynamics of ecosystems. three basic types of ecosystem modeling are routinely used in research and ecosystem management: a conceptual model, an analytical model, and a simulation model. a conceptual model is an ecosystem model that consists of flow charts to show interactions of different compartments of the living and nonliving components of the ecosystem. a conceptual model describes ecosystem structure and dynamics and shows how environmental disturbances affect the ecosystem; however, its ability to predict the effects of these disturbances is limited. analytical and simulation models, in contrast, are mathematical methods of describing ecosystems that are indeed capable of predicting the effects of potential environmental changes without direct experimentation, although with some limitations as to accuracy. an analytical model is an ecosystem model that is created using simple mathematical formulas to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics. a simulation model is an ecosystem model that is created using complex computer algorithms to holistically model ecosystems and to predict the effects of environmental disturbances on ecosystem structure and dynamics. ideally, these models are accurate enough to determine which components of the ecosystem are particularly sensitive to disturbances, and they can serve as a guide to ecosystem managers (such as conservation ecologists or fisheries biologists) in the practical maintenance of ecosystem health. conceptual models are useful for describing ecosystem structure and dynamics and for demonstrating the relationships between different organisms in a community and their environment. conceptual models are usually depicted graphically as flow charts. the organisms and their resources are grouped into specific compartments with arrows showing the relationship and transfer of energy or nutrients between them. thus, these diagrams are sometimes called compartment models. to model the cycling of mineral nutrients, organic and inorganic nutrients are subdivided into those that are bioavailable (ready to be incorporated into biological macromolecules) and those that are not. for example, in a terrestrial ecosystem near a deposit of coal, carbon will be available to the plants of this ecosystem as carbon dioxide gas in a short-term period, not from the carbon-rich coal itself. however, over a longer period, microorganisms capable of digesting coal will incorporate its carbon or release it as natural gas (methane, ch4), changing this unavailable organic source into an available one. this conversion is greatly accelerated by the combustion of fossil fuels by humans, which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. this is thought to be a major factor in the rise of the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the industrial age. the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels is produced faster than photosynthetic organisms can use it. this process is intensified by the reduction of photosynthetic trees because of worldwide deforestation. most scientists agree that high atmospheric carbon dioxide is a major cause of global climate change. conceptual models are also used to show the flow of energy through particular ecosystems. [link] is based on howard t. odums classical study of the silver springs, florida, holistic ecosystem in the mid-twentieth century.2 this study shows the energy content and transfer between various ecosystem compartments. the major limitation of conceptual models is their inability to predict the consequences of changes in ecosystem species and/or environment. ecosystems are dynamic entities and subject to a variety of abiotic and biotic disturbances caused by natural forces and/or human activity. ecosystems altered from their initial equilibrium state can often recover from such disturbances and return to a state of equilibrium. as most ecosystems are subject to periodic disturbances and are often in a state of change, they are usually either moving toward or away from their equilibrium state. there are many of these equilibrium states among the various components of an ecosystem, which affects the ecosystem overall. furthermore, as humans have the ability to greatly and rapidly alter the species content and habitat of an ecosystem, the need for predictive models that enable understanding of how ecosystems respond to these changes becomes more crucial. analytical models often use simple, linear components of ecosystems, such as food chains, and are known to be complex mathematically; therefore, they require a significant amount of mathematical knowledge and expertise. although analytical models have great potential, their simplification of complex ecosystems is thought to limit their accuracy. simulation models that use computer programs are better able to deal with the complexities of ecosystem structure. a recent development in simulation modeling uses supercomputers to create and run individual-based simulations, which accounts for the behavior of individual organisms and their effects on the ecosystem as a whole. these simulations are considered to be the most accurate and predictive of the complex responses of ecosystems to disturbances. ecosystems exist on land, at sea, in the air, and underground. different ways of modeling ecosystems are necessary to understand how environmental disturbances will affect ecosystem structure and dynamics. conceptual models are useful to show the general relationships between organisms and the flow of materials or energy between them. analytical models are used to describe linear food chains, and simulation models work best with holistic food webs.","[('secondary consumer', 'secondary consumers'), ('conceptual model', 'conceptual models'), ('tertiary consumer', 'tertiary consumers'), ('ecosystem dynamic', 'ecosystem dynamicss', 'ecosystem dynamics'), ('grazing food web', 'grazing food webs', 'grazing foods web', 'grazing foods webs'), ('apex consumer', 'apex consumers'), ('ecosystem', 'ecosystemss', 'ecosystems'), ('detrital food web', 'detrital food webs', 'detrital foods web', 'detrital foods webs'), ('ecosystem experiment', 'ecosystem experiments'), ('ecology of ecosystem', 'ecology of ecosystems', 'ecology of ecosystems', 'ecologies of ecosystem', 'ecologies of ecosystems', 'ecologies of ecosystems'), ('simulation model', 'simulation models'), ('ecological resistance', 'ecological resistances'), ('trophic level', 'trophic levels'), ('holistic ecosystem model', 'holistic ecosystem models', 'holistic ecosystems model', 'holistic ecosystems models'), ('mesocosm', 'mesocosms'), ('microcosm', 'microcosms'), ('primary consumer', 'primary consumers'), ('ecosystem modeling', 'ecosystem modelings'), ('type of ecosystem', 'type of ecosystems', 'type of ecosystems', 'types of ecosystem', 'types of ecosystems', 'types of ecosystems'), ('equilibrium', 'equilibriums'), ('food chain', 'food chains'), ('ecosystem model', 'ecosystem models'), ('ecosystem', 'ecosystems'), ('analytical model', 'analytical models'), ('ecological resilience', 'ecological resiliences'), ('ecosystem ecology', 'ecosystem ecologies'), ('ecosystem structure', 'ecosystem structures'), ('primary producer', 'primary producers'), ('food web', 'food webs')]"
246,stax-bio,46,Ecosystems,2,m44887,Energy Flow through Ecosystems,"all living things require energy in one form or another. energy is required by most complex metabolic pathways (often in the form of adenosine triphosphate, atp), especially those responsible for building large molecules from smaller compounds, and life itself is an energy-driven process. living organisms would not be able to assemble macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and complex carbohydrates) from their monomeric subunits without a constant energy input. it is important to understand how organisms acquire energy and how that energy is passed from one organism to another through food webs and their constituent food chains. food webs illustrate how energy flows directionally through ecosystems, including how efficiently organisms acquire it, use it, and how much remains for use by other organisms of the food web. energy is acquired by living things in three ways: photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, and the consumption and digestion of other living or previously living organisms by heterotrophs. photosynthetic and chemosynthetic organisms are both grouped into a category known as autotrophs: organisms capable of synthesizing their own food (more specifically, capable of using inorganic carbon as a carbon source). photosynthetic autotrophs (photoautotrophs) use sunlight as an energy source, whereas chemosynthetic autotrophs (chemoautotrophs) use inorganic molecules as an energy source. autotrophs are critical for all ecosystems. without these organisms, energy would not be available to other living organisms and life itself would not be possible. photoautotrophs, such as plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, serve as the energy source for a majority of the worlds ecosystems. these ecosystems are often described by grazing food webs. photoautotrophs harness the solar energy of the sun by converting it to chemical energy in the form of atp (and nadp). the energy stored in atp is used to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose. chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria that are found in rare ecosystems where sunlight is not available, such as in those associated with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean ([link]). many chemoautotrophs in hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide (h2s), which is released from the vents as a source of chemical energy. this allows chemoautotrophs to synthesize complex organic molecules, such as glucose, for their own energy and in turn supplies energy to the rest of the ecosystem. productivity within an ecosystem can be defined as the percentage of energy entering the ecosystem incorporated into biomass in a particular trophic level. biomass is the total mass, in a unit area at the time of measurement, of living or previously living organisms within a trophic level. ecosystems have characteristic amounts of biomass at each trophic level. for example, in the english channel ecosystem the primary producers account for a biomass of 4 g/m2 (grams per meter squared), while the primary consumers exhibit a biomass of 21 g/m2. the productivity of the primary producers is especially important in any ecosystem because these organisms bring energy to other living organisms by photoautotrophy or chemoautotrophy. the rate at which photosynthetic primary producers incorporate energy from the sun is called gross primary productivity. an example of gross primary productivity is shown in the compartment diagram of energy flow within the silver springs aquatic ecosystem as shown ([link]). in this ecosystem, the total energy accumulated by the primary producers (gross primary productivity) was shown to be 20,810 kcal/m2/yr. because all organisms need to use some of this energy for their own functions (like respiration and resulting metabolic heat loss) scientists often refer to the net primary productivity of an ecosystem. net primary productivity is the energy that remains in the primary producers after accounting for the organisms respiration and heat loss. the net productivity is then available to the primary consumers at the next trophic level. in our silver spring example, 13,187 of the 20,810 kcal/m2/yr were used for respiration or were lost as heat, leaving 7,632 kcal/m2/yr of energy for use by the primary consumers. as illustrated in [link], large amounts of energy are lost from the ecosystem from one trophic level to the next level as energy flows from the primary producers through the various trophic levels of consumers and decomposers. the main reason for this loss is the second law of thermodynamics, which states that whenever energy is converted from one form to another, there is a tendency toward disorder (entropy) in the system. in biologic systems, this means a great deal of energy is lost as metabolic heat when the organisms from one trophic level consume the next level. in the silver springs ecosystem example ([link]), we see that the primary consumers produced 1103 kcal/m2/yr from the 7618 kcal/m2/yr of energy available to them from the primary producers. the measurement of energy transfer efficiency between two successive trophic levels is termed the trophic level transfer efficiency (tlte) and is defined by the formula: in silver springs, the tlte between the first two trophic levels was approximately 14.8 percent. the low efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels is usually the major factor that limits the length of food chains observed in a food web. the fact is, after four to six energy transfers, there is not enough energy left to support another trophic level. in the lake ontario example shown in [link], only three energy transfers occurred between the primary producer, (green algae), and the apex consumer (chinook salmon).	 ecologists have many different methods of measuring energy transfers within ecosystems. some transfers are easier or more difficult to measure depending on the complexity of the ecosystem and how much access scientists have to observe the ecosystem. in other words, some ecosystems are more difficult to study than others, and sometimes the quantification of energy transfers has to be estimated. another main parameter that is important in characterizing energy flow within an ecosystem is the net production efficiency. net production efficiency (npe) allows ecologists to quantify how efficiently organisms of a particular trophic level incorporate the energy they receive into biomass; it is calculated using the following formula: net consumer productivity is the energy content available to the organisms of the next trophic level. assimilation is the biomass (energy content generated per unit area) of the present trophic level after accounting for the energy lost due to incomplete ingestion of food, energy used for respiration, and energy lost as waste. incomplete ingestion refers to the fact that some consumers eat only a part of their food. for example, when a lion kills an antelope, it will eat everything except the hide and bones. the lion is missing the energy-rich bone marrow inside the bone, so the lion does not make use of all the calories its prey could provide. thus, npe measures how efficiently each trophic level uses and incorporates the energy from its food into biomass to fuel the next trophic level. in general, cold-blooded animals (ectotherms), such as invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and reptiles, use less of the energy they obtain for respiration and heat than warm-blooded animals (endotherms), such as birds and mammals. the extra heat generated in endotherms, although an advantage in terms of the activity of these organisms in colder environments, is a major disadvantage in terms of npe. therefore, many endotherms have to eat more often than ectotherms to get the energy they need for survival. in general, npe for ectotherms is an order of magnitude (10x) higher than for endotherms. for example, the npe for a caterpillar eating leaves has been measured at 18 percent, whereas the npe for a squirrel eating acorns may be as low as 1.6 percent. the inefficiency of energy use by warm-blooded animals has broad implications for the world's food supply. it is widely accepted that the meat industry uses large amounts of crops to feed livestock, and because the npe is low, much of the energy from animal feed is lost. for example, it costs about 1 to produce 1000 dietary calories (kcal) of corn or soybeans, but approximately $0.19 to produce a similar number of calories growing cattle for beef consumption. the same energy content of milk from cattle is also costly, at approximately $0.16 per 1000 kcal. much of this difference is due to the low npe of cattle. thus, there has been a growing movement worldwide to promote the consumption of non-meat and non-dairy foods so that less energy is wasted feeding animals for the meat industry. the structure of ecosystems can be visualized with ecological pyramids, which were first described by the pioneering studies of charles elton in the 1920s. ecological pyramids show the relative amounts of various parameters (such as number of organisms, energy, and biomass) across trophic levels. pyramids of numbers can be either upright or inverted, depending on the ecosystem. as shown in [link], typical grassland during the summer has a base of many plants and the numbers of organisms decrease at each trophic level. however, during the summer in a temperate forest, the base of the pyramid consists of few trees compared with the number of primary consumers, mostly insects. because trees are large, they have great photosynthetic capability, and dominate other plants in this ecosystem to obtain sunlight. even in smaller numbers, primary producers in forests are still capable of supporting other trophic levels. another way to visualize ecosystem structure is with pyramids of biomass. this pyramid measures the amount of energy converted into living tissue at the different trophic levels. using the silver springs ecosystem example, this data exhibits an upright biomass pyramid ([link]), whereas the pyramid from the english channel example is inverted. the plants (primary producers) of the silver springs ecosystem make up a large percentage of the biomass found there. however, the phytoplankton in the english channel example make up less biomass than the primary consumers, the zooplankton. as with inverted pyramids of numbers, this inverted pyramid is not due to a lack of productivity from the primary producers, but results from the high turnover rate of the phytoplankton. the phytoplankton are consumed rapidly by the primary consumers, thus, minimizing their biomass at any particular point in time. however, phytoplankton reproduce quickly, thus they are able to support the rest of the ecosystem. pyramid ecosystem modeling can also be used to show energy flow through the trophic levels. notice that these numbers are the same as those used in the energy flow compartment diagram in [link]. pyramids of energy are always upright, and an ecosystem without sufficient primary productivity cannot be supported. all types of ecological pyramids are useful for characterizing ecosystem structure. however, in the study of energy flow through the ecosystem, pyramids of energy are the most consistent and representative models of ecosystem structure ([link]). one of the most important environmental consequences of ecosystem dynamics is biomagnification. biomagnification is the increasing concentration of persistent, toxic substances in organisms at each trophic level, from the primary producers to the apex consumers. many substances have been shown to bioaccumulate, including classical studies with the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (ddt), which was published in the 1960s bestseller, silent spring, by rachel carson. ddt was a commonly used pesticide before its dangers became known. in some aquatic ecosystems, organisms from each trophic level consumed many organisms of the lower level, which caused ddt to increase in birds (apex consumers) that ate fish. thus, the birds accumulated sufficient amounts of ddt to cause fragility in their eggshells. this effect increased egg breakage during nesting and was shown to have adverse effects on these bird populations. the use of ddt was banned in the united states in the 1970s. other substances that biomagnify are polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs), which were used in coolant liquids in the united states until their use was banned in 1979, and heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. these substances were best studied in aquatic ecosystems, where fish species at different trophic levels accumulate toxic substances brought through the ecosystem by the primary producers. as illustrated in a study performed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) in the saginaw bay of lake huron ([link]), pcb concentrations increased from the ecosystems primary producers (phytoplankton) through the different trophic levels of fish species. the apex consumer (walleye) has more than four times the amount of pcbs compared to phytoplankton. also, based on results from other studies, birds that eat these fish may have pcb levels at least one order of magnitude higher than those found in the lake fish. other concerns have been raised by the accumulation of heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium, in certain types of seafood. the united states environmental protection agency (epa) recommends that pregnant women and young children should not consume any swordfish, shark, king mackerel, or tilefish because of their high mercury content. these individuals are advised to eat fish low in mercury: salmon, tilapia, shrimp, pollock, and catfish. biomagnification is a good example of how ecosystem dynamics can affect our everyday lives, even influencing the food we eat. organisms in an ecosystem acquire energy in a variety of ways, which is transferred between trophic levels as the energy flows from the bottom to the top of the food web, with energy being lost at each transfer. the efficiency of these transfers is important for understanding the different behaviors and eating habits of warm-blooded versus cold-blooded animals. modeling of ecosystem energy is best done with ecological pyramids of energy, although other ecological pyramids provide other vital information about ecosystem structure.","[('chemoautotroph',

247,stax-bio,46,Ecosystems,3,m44889,Biogeochemical Cycles,"energy flows directionally through ecosystems, entering as sunlight (or inorganic molecules for chemoautotrophs) and leaving as heat during the many transfers between trophic levels. however, the matter that makes up living organisms is conserved and recycled. the six most common elements associated with organic moleculescarbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfurtake a variety of chemical forms and may exist for long periods in the atmosphere, on land, in water, or beneath the earths surface. geologic processes, such as weathering, erosion, water drainage, and the subduction of the continental plates, all play a role in this recycling of materials. because geology and chemistry have major roles in the study of this process, the recycling of inorganic matter between living organisms and their environment is called a biogeochemical cycle. water contains hydrogen and oxygen, which is essential to all living processes. the hydrosphere is the area of the earth where water movement and storage occurs: as liquid water on the surface and beneath the surface or frozen (rivers, lakes, oceans, groundwater, polar ice caps, and glaciers), and as water vapor in the atmosphere. carbon is found in all organic macromolecules and is an important constituent of fossil fuels. nitrogen is a major component of our nucleic acids and proteins and is critical to human agriculture. phosphorus, a major component of nucleic acid (along with nitrogen), is one of the main ingredients in artificial fertilizers used in agriculture and their associated environmental impacts on our surface water. sulfur, critical to the 3d folding of proteins (as in disulfide binding), is released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal. the cycling of these elements is interconnected. for example, the movement of water is critical for the leaching of nitrogen and phosphate into rivers, lakes, and oceans. furthermore, the ocean itself is a major reservoir for carbon. thus, mineral nutrients are cycled, either rapidly or slowly, through the entire biosphere, from one living organism to another, and between the biotic and abiotic world. water is the basis of all living processes. the human body is more than 1/2 water and human cells are more than 70 percent water. thus, most land animals need a supply of fresh water to survive. however, when examining the stores of water on earth, 97.5 percent of it is non-potable salt water ([link]). of the remaining water, 99 percent is locked underground as water or as ice. thus, less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily accessible from lakes and rivers. many living things, such as plants, animals, and fungi, are dependent on the small amount of fresh surface water supply, a lack of which can have massive effects on ecosystem dynamics. humans, of course, have developed technologies to increase water availability, such as digging wells to harvest groundwater, storing rainwater, and using desalination to obtain drinkable water from the ocean. although this pursuit of drinkable water has been ongoing throughout human history, the supply of fresh water is still a major issue in modern times. water cycling is extremely important to ecosystem dynamics. water has a major influence on climate and, thus, on the environments of ecosystems, some located on distant parts of the earth. most of the water on earth is stored for long periods in the oceans, underground, and as ice. [link] illustrates the average time that an individual water molecule may spend in the earths major water reservoirs. residence time is a measure of the average time an individual water molecule stays in a particular reservoir. a large amount of the earths water is locked in place in these reservoirs as ice, beneath the ground, and in the ocean, and, thus, is unavailable for short-term cycling (only surface water can evaporate). there are various processes that occur during the cycling of water, shown in [link]. these processes include the following: the water cycle is driven by the suns energy as it warms the oceans and other surface waters. this leads to the evaporation (water to water vapor) of liquid surface water and the sublimation (ice to water vapor) of frozen water, which deposits large amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. over time, this water vapor condenses into clouds as liquid or frozen droplets and is eventually followed by precipitation (rain or snow), which returns water to the earths surface. rain eventually permeates into the ground, where it may evaporate again if it is near the surface, flow beneath the surface, or be stored for long periods. more easily observed is surface runoff: the flow of fresh water either from rain or melting ice. runoff can then make its way through streams and lakes to the oceans or flow directly to the oceans themselves. rain and surface runoff are major ways in which minerals, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, are cycled from land to water. the environmental effects of runoff will be discussed later as these cycles are described. carbon is the second most abundant element in living organisms. carbon is present in all organic molecules, and its role in the structure of macromolecules is of primary importance to living organisms. carbon compounds contain especially high energy, particularly those derived from fossilized organisms, mainly plants, which humans use as fuel. since the 1800s, the number of countries using massive amounts of fossil fuels has increased. since the beginning of the industrial revolution, global demand for the earths limited fossil fuel supplies has risen; therefore, the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased. this increase in carbon dioxide has been associated with climate change and other disturbances of the earths ecosystems and is a major environmental concern worldwide. thus, the carbon footprint is based on how much carbon dioxide is produced and how much fossil fuel countries consume. the carbon cycle is most easily studied as two interconnected sub-cycles: one dealing with rapid carbon exchange among living organisms and the other dealing with the long-term cycling of carbon through geologic processes. the entire carbon cycle is shown in [link]. living organisms are connected in many ways, even between ecosystems. a good example of this connection is the exchange of carbon between autotrophs and heterotrophs within and between ecosystems by way of atmospheric carbon dioxide. carbon dioxide is the basic building block that most autotrophs use to build multi-carbon, high energy compounds, such as glucose. the energy harnessed from the sun is used by these organisms to form the covalent bonds that link carbon atoms together. these chemical bonds thereby store this energy for later use in the process of respiration. most terrestrial autotrophs obtain their carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere, while marine autotrophs acquire it in the dissolved form (carbonic acid, h2co3). however carbon dioxide is acquired, a by-product of the process is oxygen. the photosynthetic organisms are responsible for depositing approximately 21 percent oxygen content of the atmosphere that we observe today. heterotrophs and autotrophs are partners in biological carbon exchange (especially the primary consumers, largely herbivores). heterotrophs acquire the high-energy carbon compounds from the autotrophs by consuming them, and breaking them down by respiration to obtain cellular energy, such as atp. the most efficient type of respiration, aerobic respiration, requires oxygen obtained from the atmosphere or dissolved in water. thus, there is a constant exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the autotrophs (which need the carbon) and the heterotrophs (which need the oxygen). gas exchange through the atmosphere and water is one way that the carbon cycle connects all living organisms on earth. the movement of carbon through the land, water, and air is complex, and in many cases, it occurs much more slowly geologically than as seen between living organisms. carbon is stored for long periods in what are known as carbon reservoirs, which include the atmosphere, bodies of liquid water (mostly oceans), ocean sediment, soil, land sediments (including fossil fuels), and the earths interior. as stated, the atmosphere is a major reservoir of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and is essential to the process of photosynthesis. the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is greatly influenced by the reservoir of carbon in the oceans. the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and water reservoirs influences how much carbon is found in each location, and each one affects the other reciprocally. carbon dioxide (co2) from the atmosphere dissolves in water and combines with water molecules to form carbonic acid, and then it ionizes to carbonate and bicarbonate ions ([link]) the equilibrium coefficients are such that more than 90 percent of the carbon in the ocean is found as bicarbonate ions. some of these ions combine with seawater calcium to form calcium carbonate (caco3), a major component of marine organism shells. these organisms eventually form sediments on the ocean floor. over geologic time, the calcium carbonate forms limestone, which comprises the largest carbon reservoir on earth. on land, carbon is stored in soil as a result of the decomposition of living organisms (by decomposers) or from weathering of terrestrial rock and minerals. this carbon can be leached into the water reservoirs by surface runoff. deeper underground, on land and at sea, are fossil fuels: the anaerobically decomposed remains of plants that take millions of years to form. fossil fuels are considered a non-renewable resource because their use far exceeds their rate of formation. a non-renewable resource, such as fossil fuel, is either regenerated very slowly or not at all. another way for carbon to enter the atmosphere is from land (including land beneath the surface of the ocean) by the eruption of volcanoes and other geothermal systems. carbon sediments from the ocean floor are taken deep within the earth by the process of subduction: the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another. carbon is released as carbon dioxide when a volcano erupts or from volcanic hydrothermal vents. carbon dioxide is also added to the atmosphere by the animal husbandry practices of humans. the large numbers of land animals raised to feed the earths growing population results in increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere due to farming practices and the respiration and methane production. this is another example of how human activity indirectly affects biogeochemical cycles in a significant way. although much of the debate about the future effects of increasing atmospheric carbon on climate change focuses on fossils fuels, scientists take natural processes, such as volcanoes and respiration, into account as they model and predict the future impact of this increase. getting nitrogen into the living world is difficult. plants and phytoplankton are not equipped to incorporate nitrogen from the atmosphere (which exists as tightly bonded, triple covalent n2) even though this molecule comprises approximately 78 percent of the atmosphere. nitrogen enters the living world via free-living and symbiotic bacteria, which incorporate nitrogen into their macromolecules through nitrogen fixation (conversion of n2). cyanobacteria live in most aquatic ecosystems where sunlight is present; they play a key role in nitrogen fixation. cyanobacteria are able to use inorganic sources of nitrogen to fix nitrogen. rhizobium bacteria live symbiotically in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, beans, and peanuts) and provide them with the organic nitrogen they need. free-living bacteria, such as azotobacter, are also important nitrogen fixers. organic nitrogen is especially important to the study of ecosystem dynamics since many ecosystem processes, such as primary production and decomposition, are limited by the available supply of nitrogen. as shown in [link], the nitrogen that enters living systems by nitrogen fixation is successively converted from organic nitrogen back into nitrogen gas by bacteria. this process occurs in three steps in terrestrial systems: ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. first, the ammonification process converts nitrogenous waste from living animals or from the remains of dead animals into ammonium (nh4+) by certain bacteria and fungi. second, the ammonium is converted to nitrites (no2) by nitrifying bacteria, such as nitrosomonas, through nitrification. subsequently, nitrites are converted to nitrates (no3) by similar organisms. third, the process of denitrification occurs, whereby bacteria, such as pseudomonas and clostridium, convert the nitrates into nitrogen gas, allowing it to re-enter the atmosphere. human activity can release nitrogen into the environment by two primary means: the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases different nitrogen oxides, and by the use of artificial fertilizers in agriculture, which are then washed into lakes, streams, and rivers by surface runoff. atmospheric nitrogen is associated with several effects on earths ecosystems including the production of acid rain (as nitric acid, hno3) and greenhouse gas (as nitrous oxide, n2o) potentially causing climate change. a major effect from fertilizer runoff is saltwater and freshwater eutrophication, a process whereby nutrient runoff causes the excess growth of microorganisms, depleting dissolved oxygen levels and killing ecosystem fauna. a similar process occurs in the marine nitrogen cycle, where the ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification processes are performed by marine bacteria. some of this nitrogen falls to the ocean floor as sediment, which can then be moved to land in geologic time by uplift of the earths surface and thereby incorporated into terrestrial rock. although the movement of nitrogen from rock directly into living systems has been traditionally seen as insignificant compared with nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere, a recent study showed that this process may indeed be significant and should be included in any study of the global nitrogen cycle.1 phosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes; it is a major component of nucleic acid and phospholipids, and, as calcium phosphate, makes up the supportive components of our bones. phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary for growth) in aquatic ecosystems ([link]). phosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (po43). in addition to phosphate runoff as a result of human activity, natural surface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock by weathering, thus sending phosphates into rivers, lakes, and the ocean. this rock has its origins in the ocean. phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions. however, in remote regions, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust may also be significant phosphate sources. this sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the uplifting of areas of the earths surface. phosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine ecosystems. the movement of phosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely slow, with the average phosphate ion having an oceanic residence time between 20,000 and 100,000 years. excess phosphorus and nitrogen that enters these ecosystems from fertilizer runoff and from sewage causes excessive growth of microorganisms and depletes the dissolved oxygen, which leads to the death of many ecosystem fauna, such as shellfish and finfish. this process is responsible for dead zones in lakes and at the mouths of many major rivers ([link]). a dead zone is an area within a freshwater or marine ecosystem where large areas are depleted of their normal flora and fauna; these zones can be caused by eutrophication, oil spills, dumping of toxic chemicals, and other human activities. the number of dead zones has been increasing for several years, and more than 400 of these zones were present as of 2008. one of the worst dead zones is off the coast of the united states in the gulf of mexico, where fertilizer runoff from the mississippi river basin has created a dead zone of over 8463square miles. phosphate and nitrate runoff from fertilizers also negatively affect several lake and bay ecosystems including the chesapeake bay in the eastern united states. chesapeake bay the chesapeake bay has long been valued as one of the most scenic areas on earth; it is now in distress and is recognized as a declining ecosystem. in the 1970s, the chesapeake bay was one of the first ecosystems to have identified dead zones, which continue to kill many fish and bottom-dwelling species, such as clams, oysters, and worms. several species have declined in the chesapeake bay due to surface water runoff containing excess nutrients from artificial fertilizer used on land. the source of the fertilizers (with high nitrogen and phosphate content) is not limited to agricultural practices. there are many nearby urban areas and more than 150 rivers and streams empty into the bay that are carrying fertilizer runoff from lawns and gardens. thus, the decline of the chesapeake bay is a complex issue and requires the cooperation of industry, agriculture, and everyday homeowners. of particular interest to conservationists is the oyster population; it is estimated that more than 200,000 acres of oyster reefs existed in the bay in the 1700s, but that number has now declined to only 36,000 acres. oyster harvesting was once a major industry for chesapeake bay, but it declined 88 percent between 1982 and 2007. this decline was due not only to fertilizer runoff and dead zones but also to overharvesting. oysters require a certain minimum population density because they must be in close proximity to reproduce. human activity has altered the oyster population and locations, greatly disrupting the ecosystem. the restoration of the oyster population in the chesapeake bay has been ongoing for several years with mixed success. not only do many people find oysters good to eat, but they also clean up the bay. oysters are filter feeders, and as they eat, they clean the water around them. in the 1700s, it was estimated that it took only a few days for the oyster population to filter the entire volume of the bay. today, with changed water conditions, it is estimated that the present population would take nearly a year to do the same job. restoration efforts have been ongoing for several years by non-profit organizations, such as the chesapeake bay foundation. the restoration goal is to find a way to increase population density so the oysters can reproduce more efficiently. many disease-resistant varieties (developed at the virginia institute of marine science for the college of william and mary) are now available and have been used in the construction of experimental oyster reefs. efforts to clean and restore the bay by virginia and delaware have been hampered because much of the pollution entering the bay comes from other states, which stresses the need for inter-state cooperation to gain successful restoration. the new, hearty oyster strains have also spawned a new and economically viable industryoyster aquaculturewhich not only supplies oysters for food and profit, but also has the added benefit of cleaning the bay. sulfur is an essential element for the macromolecules of living things. as a part of the amino acid cysteine, it is involved in the formation of disulfide bonds within proteins, which help to determine their 3-d folding patterns, and hence their functions. as shown in [link], sulfur cycles between the oceans, land, and atmosphere. atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (so2) and enters the atmosphere in three ways: from the decomposition of organic molecules, from volcanic activity and geothermal vents, and from the burning of fossil fuels by humans. on land, sulfur is deposited in four major ways: precipitation, direct fallout from the atmosphere, rock weathering, and geothermal vents ([link]). atmospheric sulfur is found in the form of sulfur dioxide (so2), and as rain falls through the atmosphere, sulfur is dissolved in the form of weak sulfuric acid (h2so4). sulfur can also fall directly from the atmosphere in a process called fallout. also, the weathering of sulfur-containing rocks releases sulfur into the soil. these rocks originate from ocean sediments that are moved to land by the geologic uplifting of ocean sediments. terrestrial ecosystems can then make use of these soil sulfates (

), and upon the death and decomposition of these organisms, release the sulfur back into the atmosphere as hydrogen sulfide (h2s) gas. sulfur enters the ocean via runoff from land, from atmospheric fallout, and from underwater geothermal vents. some ecosystems ([link]) rely on chemoautotrophs using sulfur as a biological energy source. this sulfur then supports marine ecosystems in the form of sulfates. human activities have played a major role in altering the balance of the global sulfur cycle. the burning of large quantities of fossil fuels, especially from coal, releases larger amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas into the atmosphere. as rain falls through this gas, it creates the phenomenon known as acid rain. acid rain is corrosive rain caused by rainwater falling to the ground through sulfur dioxide gas, turning it into weak sulfuric acid, which causes damage to aquatic ecosystems. acid rain damages the natural environment by lowering the ph of lakes, which kills many of the resident fauna; it also affects the man-made environment through the chemical degradation of buildings. for example, many marble monuments, such as the lincoln memorial in washington, dc, have suffered significant damage from acid rain over the years. these examples show the wide-ranging effects of human activities on our environment and the challenges that remain for our future. mineral nutrients are cycled through ecosystems and their environment. of particular importance are water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. all of these cycles have major impacts on ecosystem structure and function. as human activities have caused major disturbances to these cycles, their study and modeling is especially important. a variety of human activities, such as pollution, oil spills, and events) have damaged ecosystems, potentially causing global climate change. the health of earth depends on understanding these cycles and how to protect the environment from irreversible damage.","[('sulfur cycle', 'sulfur cycles'), ('biological carbon cycle', 'biological carbon cycles', 'biological carbons cycle', 'biological carbons cycles'), ('carbon cycle', 'carbon cycles'), ('eutrophication', 'eutrophications'), ('residence time', 'residence times'), ('hydrologic cycle', 'hydrologic cycles'), ('ecosystem', 'ecosystems'), ('acid rain', 'acid rains'), ('chesapeake bay ecosystem', 'chesapeake bay ecosystems', 'chesapeake bays ecosystem', 'chesapeake bays ecosystems', 'chesapeakes bay ecosystem', 'chesapeakes bay ecosystems', 'chesapeakes bays ecosystem', 'chesapeakes bays ecosystems'), ('fallout', 'fallouts'), ('non-renewable resource', 'non-renewable resources'), ('subduction', 'subductions'), ('nitrogen cycle', 'nitrogen cycles'), ('phosphoru cycle', 'phosphoru cycles'), ('ecosystem', 'ecosystemss', 'ecosystems'), ('geological carbon cycle', 'geological carbon cycles', 'geological carbons cycle', 'geological carbons cycles'), ('water cycle', 'water cycles'), ('dead zone', 'dead zones'), ('biogeochemical cycle', 'biogeochemical cycles')]"
248,stax-bio,47,Conservation Biology and Biodiversity,0,m44890,Introduction,"in the 1980s, biologists working in lake victoria in africa discovered one of the most extraordinary products of evolution on the planet. located in the great rift valley, lake victoria is a large lake about 68,900 km2 in area (larger than lake huron, the second largest of north americas great lakes). biologists were studying species of a family of fish called cichlids. they found that as they sampled for fish in different locations of the lake, they never stopped finding new species, and they identified nearly 500 evolved types of cichlids. but while studying these variations, they quickly discovered that the invasive nile perch was destroying the lakes cichlid population, bringing hundreds of cichlid species to extinction with devastating rapidity.","[('dna barcoding', 'dna barcodings'), ('chytridiomycosi', 'chytridiomycoses', 'chytridiomycosis'), ('mas extinction', 'mas extinctions'), ('wood product', 'wood productss', 'wood products'), ('climate change', 'climate changes'), ('white-nose syndrome', 'white-nose syndromes'), ('exotic specy', 'exotic species'), ('extinction', 'extinctions'), ('wild food source', 'wild food sourcess', 'wild food sources', 'wild foods source', 'wild foods sourcess', 'wild foods sources'), ('zoo', 'zoos'), ('preserve design', 'preserve designs'), ('preserve', 'preserves'), ('habitat restoration', 'habitat restorations'), ('biogeographer', 'biogeographers'), ('biodiversity crisi', 'biodiversity crises', 'biodiversity crisis'), ('secondary plant compound', 'secondary plant compoundss', 'secondary plant compounds', 'secondary plants compound', 'secondary plants compoundss', 'secondary plants compounds'), ('kyoto protocol', 'kyoto protocols'), ('heterogeneity', 'heterogeneities'), ('endemic specy', 'endemic species'), ('genetic diversity', 'genetic diversities'), ('organism diversity', 'organism diversities'), ('threat to biodiversity', 'threat to biodiversity', 'threats to biodiversity', 'threats to biodiversity'), ('migratory bird act', 'migratory bird acts', 'migratory birds act', 'migratory birds acts'), ('ecosystem diversity', 'ecosystem diversities'), ('pleistocene extinction', 'pleistocene extinctions'), ('pattern of biodiversity', 'pattern of biodiversity', 'patterns of biodiversity', 'patterns of biodiversity'), ('biodiversity hotspot', 'biodiversity hotspots'), ('e. o. wilson', 'e. o. wilsons', 'e. o.s wilson', 'e. o.s wilsons', 'e.s o. wilson', 'e.s o. wilsons', 'e.s o.s wilson', 'e.s o.s wilsons'), ('agricultural diversity', 'agricultural diversities'), ('wn', 'wnss', 'wns'), ('bush meat', 'bush meat'), ('biodiversity', 'biodiversities'), ('adaptive radiation', 'adaptive radiations'), ('conservation', 'conservations'), ('measuring biodiversity', 'measuring biodiversities'), ('chemical diversity', 'chemical diversities'), ('endangered species act', 'endangered species acts', 'endangered species act', 'endangered species acts'), ('over-harvesting', 'over-harvestings'), ('wildlife preserve', 'wildlife preserves'), ('tragedy of the common', 'tragedy of the commons', 'tragedy of the commons', 'tragedies of the common', 'tragedies of the commons', 'tragedies of the commons'), ('biodiversity preservation', 'biodiversity preservations'), ('preservation', 'preservations'), ('megafauna', 'megafaunas'), ('species diversity', 'species diversities'), ('cite', 'citess', 'cites'), ('nature preserve', 'nature preserves'), ('bioethic', 'bioethicss', 'bioethics'), ('species-area relationship', 'species-area relationships'), ('importance of biodiversity', 'importance of biodiversity', 'importances of biodiversity', 'importances of biodiversity'), ('habitat los', 'habitat losses', 'habitat loss'), ('extinction rate', 'extinction rates')]"
249,stax-bio,47,Conservation Biology and Biodiversity,1,m44892,The Biodiversity Crisis,"traditionally, ecologists have measured biodiversity, a general term for the variety present in the biosphere, by taking into account both the number of species and their commonness. biodiversity can be estimated at a number of levels of organization of living things. these estimation indexes, which came from information theory, are most useful as a first step in quantifying biodiversity between and within ecosystems; they are less useful when the main concern among conservation biologists is simply the loss of biodiversity. however, biologists recognize that measures of biodiversity, in terms of species diversity, may help focus efforts to preserve the biologically or technologically important elements of biodiversity. the lake victoria cichlids provide an example through which we can begin to understand biodiversity. the biologists studying cichlids in the 1980s discovered hundreds of cichlid species representing a variety of specializations to particular habitat types and specific feeding strategies: eating plankton floating in the water, scraping and then eating algae from rocks, eating insect larvae from the bottom, and eating the eggs of other species of cichlid. the cichlids of lake victoria are the product of an adaptive radiation. an adaptive radiation is a rapid (less than three million years in the case of the lake victoria cichlids) branching through speciation of a phylogenetic tree into many closely related species; typically, the species radiate into different habitats and niches. the galpagos finches are an example of a modest adaptive radiation with 15 species. the cichlids of lake victoria are an example of a spectacular adaptive radiation that includes about 500 species. at the time biologists were making this discovery, some species began to quickly disappear. a culprit in these declines was a species of large fish that was introduced to lake victoria by fisheries to feed the people living around the lake. the nile perch was introduced in 1963, but lay low until the 1980s when its populations began to surge. the nile perch population grew by consuming cichlids, driving species after species to the point of extinction (the disappearance of a species). in fact, there were several factors that played a role in the extinction of perhaps 200 cichlid species in lake victoria: the nile perch, declining lake water quality due to agriculture and land clearing on the shores of lake victoria, and increased fishing pressure. scientists had not even catalogued all of the species presentso many were lost that were never named. the diversity is now a shadow of what it once was. the cichlids of lake victoria are a thumbnail sketch of contemporary rapid species loss that occurs all over earth and is caused by human activity. extinction is a natural process of macroevolution that occurs at the rate of about one out of 1 million species becoming extinct per year. the fossil record reveals that there have been five periods of mass extinction in history with much higher rates of species loss, and the rate of species loss today is comparable to those periods of mass extinction. however, there is a major difference between the previous mass extinctions and the current extinction we are experiencing: human activity. specifically, three human activities have a major impact: destruction of habitat, introduction of exotic species, and over-harvesting. predictions of species loss within the next century, a tiny amount of time on geological timescales, range from 10 percent to 50 percent. extinctions on this scale have only happened five other times in the history of the planet, and they have been caused by cataclysmic events that changed the course of the history of life in each instance. earth is now in one of those times. scientists generally accept that the term biodiversity describes the number and kinds of species in a location or on the planet. species can be difficult to define, but most biologists still feel comfortable with the concept and are able to identify and count eukaryotic species in most contexts. biologists have also identified alternate measures of biodiversity, some of which are important for planning how to preserve biodiversity. genetic diversity is one of those alternate concepts. genetic diversity or variation is the raw material for adaptation in a species. a species future potential for adaptation depends on the genetic diversity held in the genomes of the individuals in populations that make up the species. the same is true for higher taxonomic categories. a genus with very different types of species will have more genetic diversity than a genus with species that look alike and have similar ecologies. if there were a choice between one of these genera of species being preserved, the one with the greatest potential for subsequent evolution is the most genetically diverse one. it would be ideal not to have to make such choices, but increasingly this may be the norm. many genes code for proteins, which in turn carry out the metabolic processes that keep organisms alive and reproducing. genetic diversity can be measured as chemical diversity in that different species produce a variety of chemicals in their cells, both the proteins as well as the products and byproducts of metabolism. this chemical diversity has potential benefit for humans as a source of pharmaceuticals, so it provides one way to measure diversity that is important to human health and welfare. humans have generated diversity in domestic animals, plants, and fungi. this diversity is also suffering losses because of migration, market forces, and increasing globalism in agriculture, especially in heavily populated regions such as china, india, and japan. the human population directly depends on this diversity as a stable food source, and its decline is troubling biologists and agricultural scientists. it is also useful to define ecosystem diversity, meaning the number of different ecosystems on the planet or in a given geographic area ([link]). whole ecosystems can disappear even if some of the species might survive by adapting to other ecosystems. the loss of an ecosystem means the loss of interactions between species, the loss of unique features of coadaptation, and the loss of biological productivity that an ecosystem is able to create. an example of a largely extinct ecosystem in north america is the prairie ecosystem. prairies once spanned central north america from the boreal forest in northern canada down into mexico. they are now all but gone, replaced by crop fields, pasture lands, and suburban sprawl. many of the species survive, but the hugely productive ecosystem that was responsible for creating the most productive agricultural soils is now gone. as a consequence, soils are disappearing or must be maintained at greater expense. despite considerable effort, knowledge of the species that inhabit the planet is limited. a recent estimate suggests that the eukaryote species for which science has names, about 1.5 million species, account for less than 20 percent of the total number of eukaryote species present on the planet (8.7 million species, by one estimate). estimates of numbers of prokaryotic species are largely guesses, but biologists agree that science has only begun to catalog their diversity. even with what is known, there is no central repository of names or samples of the described species; therefore, there is no way to be sure that the 1.5 million descriptions is an accurate number. it is a best guess based on the opinions of experts in different taxonomic groups. given that earth is losing species at an accelerating pace, science is very much in the place it was with the lake victoria cichlids: knowing little about what is being lost. [link] presents recent estimates of biodiversity in different groups. there are various initiatives to catalog described species in accessible ways, and the internet is facilitating that effort. nevertheless, it has been pointed out that at the current rate of species description, which according to the state of observed species report is 17,000 to 20,000 new species per year, it will take close to 500 years to finish describing life on this planet.4 over time, the task becomes both increasingly impossible and increasingly easier as extinction removes species from the planet. naming and counting species may seem an unimportant pursuit given the other needs of humanity, but it is not simply an accounting. describing species is a complex process by which biologists determine an organisms unique characteristics and whether or not that organism belongs to any other described species. it allows biologists to find and recognize the species after the initial discovery, and allows them to follow up on questions about its biology. in addition, the unique characteristics of each species make it potentially valuable to humans or other species on which humans depend. understanding these characteristics is the value of finding and naming species. biodiversity is not evenly distributed on earth. lake victoria contained almost 500 species of cichlids alone, ignoring the other fish families present in the lake. all of these species were found only in lake victoria; therefore, the 500 species of cichlids were endemic. endemic species are found in only one location. endemics with highly restricted distributions are particularly vulnerable to extinction. higher taxonomic levels, such as genera and families, can also be endemic. lake huron contains about 79 species of fish, all of which are found in many other lakes in north america. what accounts for the difference in fish diversity in these two lakes? lake victoria is a tropical lake, while lake huron is a temperate lake. lake huron in its present form is only about 7,000 years old, while lake victoria in its present form is about 15,000 years old. biogeographers have suggested these two factors, latitude and age, are two of several hypotheses to explain biodiversity patterns on the planet. biogeographerbiogeography is the study of the distribution of the worlds speciesboth in the past and in the present. the work of biogeographers is critical to understanding our physical environment, how the environment affects species, and how environmental changes impact the distribution of a species; it has also been critical to developing evolutionary theory. biogeographers need to understand both biology and ecology. they also need to be well-versed in evolutionary studies, soil science, and climatology. there are three main fields of study under the heading of biogeography: ecological biogeography, historical biogeography (called paleobiogeography), and conservation biogeography. ecological biogeography studies the current factors affecting the distribution of plants and animals. historical biogeography, as the name implies, studies the past distribution of species. conservation biogeography, on the other hand, is focused on the protection and restoration of species based upon known historical and current ecological information. each of these fields considers both zoogeography and phytogeographythe past and present distribution of animals and plants. one of the oldest observed patterns in ecology is that species biodiversity in almost every taxonomic group increases as latitude declines. in other words, biodiversity increases closer to the equator ([link]). it is not yet clear why biodiversity increases closer to the equator, but hypotheses include the greater age of the ecosystems in the tropics versus temperate regions that were largely devoid of life or drastically impoverished during the last glaciation. the idea is that greater age provides more time for speciation. another possible explanation is the increased energy the tropics receive from the sun versus the decreased energy that temperate and polar regions receive. it is not entirely clear how greater energy input could translate into more species. the complexity of tropical ecosystems may promote speciation by increasing the heterogeneity, or number of ecological niches, in the tropics relative to higher latitudes. the greater heterogeneity provides more opportunities for coevolution, specialization, and perhaps greater selection pressures leading to population differentiation. however, this hypothesis suffers from some circularityecosystems with more species encourage speciation, but how did they get more species to begin with? the tropics have been perceived as being more stable than temperate regions, which have a pronounced climate and day-length seasonality. the tropics have their own forms of seasonality, such as rainfall, but they are generally assumed to be more stable environments and this stability might promote speciation. regardless of the mechanisms, it is certainly true that all levels of biodiversity are greatest in the tropics. additionally, the rate of endemism is highest, and there are more biodiversity hotspots. however, this richness of diversity also means that knowledge of species is lowest, and there is a high potential for biodiversity loss. in 1988, british environmentalist norman myers developed a conservation concept to identify areas rich in species and at significant risk for species loss: biodiversity hotspots. biodiversity hotspots are geographical areas that contain high numbers of endemic species. the purpose of the concept was to identify important locations on the planet for conservation efforts, a kind of conservation triage. by protecting hotspots, governments are able to protect a larger number of species. the original criteria for a hotspot included the presence of 1500 or more endemic plant species and 70 percent of the area disturbed by human activity. there are now 34 biodiversity hotspots ([link]) containing large numbers of endemic species, which include half of earths endemic plants. the number of species on the planet, or in any geographical area, is the result of an equilibrium of two evolutionary processes that are ongoing: speciation and extinction. both are natural birth and death processes of macroevolution. when speciation rates begin to outstrip extinction rates, the number of species will increase; likewise, the number of species will decrease when extinction rates begin to overtake speciation rates. throughout earths history, these two processes have fluctuatedsometimes leading to dramatic changes in the number of species on earth as reflected in the fossil record ([link]). paleontologists have identified five strata in the fossil record that appear to show sudden and dramatic (greater than half of all extant species disappearing from the fossil record) losses in biodiversity. these are called mass extinctions. there are many lesser, yet still dramatic, extinction events, but the five mass extinctions have attracted the most research. an argument can be made that the five mass extinctions are only the five most extreme events in a continuous series of large extinction events throughout the phanerozoic (since 542 million years ago). in most cases, the hypothesized causes are still controversial; however, the most recent event seems clear. the fossil record of the mass extinctions was the basis for defining periods of geological history, so they typically occur at the transition point between geological periods. the transition in fossils from one period to another reflects the dramatic loss of species and the gradual origin of new species. these transitions can be seen in the rock strata. [link] provides data on the five mass extinctions. the ordovician-silurian extinction event is the first recorded mass extinction and the second largest. during this period, about 85 percent of marine species (few species lived outside the oceans) became extinct. the main hypothesis for its cause is a period of glaciation and then warming. the extinction event actually consists of two extinction events separated by about 1 million years. the first event was caused by cooling, and the second event was due to the subsequent warming. the climate changes affected temperatures and sea levels. some researchers have suggested that a gamma-ray burst, caused by a nearby supernova, is a possible cause of the ordovician-silurian extinction. the gamma-ray burst would have stripped away the earths ozone layer causing intense ultraviolet radiation from the sun and may account for climate changes observed at the time. the hypothesis is speculative, but extraterrestrial influences on earths history are an active line of research. recovery of biodiversity after the mass extinction took from 5 to 20 million years, depending on the location. the late devonian extinction may have occurred over a relatively long period of time. it appears to have affected marine species and not the plants or animals inhabiting terrestrial habitats. the causes of this extinction are poorly understood. the end-permian extinction was the largest in the history of life. indeed, an argument could be made that earth nearly became devoid of life during this extinction event. the planet looked very different before and after this event. estimates are that 96 percent of all marine species and 70 percent of all terrestrial species were lost. it was at this time, for example, that the trilobites, a group that survived the ordoviciansilurian extinction, became extinct. the causes for this mass extinction are not clear, but the leading suspect is extended and widespread volcanic activity that led to a runaway global-warming event. the oceans became largely anoxic, suffocating marine life. terrestrial tetrapod diversity took 30 million years to recover after the end-permian extinction. the permian extinction dramatically altered earths biodiversity makeup and the course of evolution. the causes of the triassicjurassic extinction event are not clear and hypotheses of climate change, asteroid impact, and volcanic eruptions have been argued. the extinction event occurred just before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea, although recent scholarship suggests that the extinctions may have occurred more gradually throughout the triassic. the causes of the end-cretaceous extinction event are the ones that are best understood. it was during this extinction event about 65 million years ago that the dinosaurs, the dominant vertebrate group for millions of years, disappeared from the planet (with the exception of a theropod clade that gave rise to birds). indeed, every land animal that weighed more then 25 kg became extinct. the cause of this extinction is now understood to be the result of a cataclysmic impact of a large meteorite, or asteroid, off the coast of what is now the yucatn peninsula. this hypothesis, proposed first in 1980, was a radical explanation based on a sharp spike in the levels of iridium (which rains down from space in meteors at a fairly constant rate but is otherwise absent on earths surface) at the rock stratum that marks the boundary between the cretaceous and paleogene periods ([link]). this boundary marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs in fossils as well as many other taxa. the researchers who discovered the iridium spike interpreted it as a rapid influx of iridium from space to the atmosphere (in the form of a large asteroid) rather than a slowing in the deposition of sediments during that period. it was a radical explanation, but the report of an appropriately aged and sized impact crater in 1991 made the hypothesis more believable. now an abundance of geological evidence supports the theory. recovery times for biodiversity after the end-cretaceous extinction are shorter, in geological time, than for the end-permian extinction, on the order of 10 million years. the pleistocene extinction is one of the lesser extinctions, and a recent one. it is well known that the north american, and to some degree eurasian, megafauna, or large animals, disappeared toward the end of the last glaciation period. the extinction appears to have happened in a relatively restricted time period of 10,00012,000 years ago. in north america, the losses were quite dramatic and included the woolly mammoths (last dated about 4,000 years ago in an isolated population), mastodon, giant beavers, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed cats, and the north american camel, just to name a few. the possibility that the rapid extinction of these large animals was caused by over-hunting was first suggested in the 1900s. research into this hypothesis continues today. it seems likely that over-hunting caused many pre-written history extinctions in many regions of the world. in general, the timing of the pleistocene extinctions correlated with the arrival of humans and not with climate-change events, which is the main competing hypothesis for these extinctions. the extinctions began in australia about 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, just after the arrival of humans in the area: a marsupial lion, a giant one-ton wombat, and several giant kangaroo species disappeared. in north america, the extinctions of almost all of the large mammals occurred 10,00012,000 years ago. all that are left are the smaller mammals such as bears, elk, moose, and cougars. finally, on many remote oceanic islands, the extinctions of many species occurred coincident with human arrivals. not all of the islands had large animals, but when there were large animals, they were lost. madagascar was colonized about 2,000 years ago and the large mammals that lived there became extinct. eurasia and africa do not show this pattern, but they also did not experience a recent arrival of humans. humans arrived in eurasia hundreds of thousands of years ago after the origin of the species in africa. this topic remains an area of active research and hypothesizing. it seems clear that even if climate played a role, in most cases human hunting precipitated the extinctions. the sixth, or holocene, mass extinction appears to have begun earlier than previously believed and has mostly to do with the activities of homo sapiens. since the beginning of the holocene period, there are numerous recent extinctions of individual species that are recorded in human writings. most of these are coincident with the expansion of the european colonies since the 1500s. one of the earlier and popularly known examples is the dodo bird. the dodo bird lived in the forests of mauritius, an island in the indian ocean. the dodo bird became extinct around 1662. it was hunted for its meat by sailors and was easy prey because the dodo, which did not evolve with humans, would approach people without fear. introduced pigs, rats, and dogs brought to the island by european ships also killed dodo young and eggs. steller's sea cow became extinct in 1768; it was related to the manatee and probably once lived along the northwest coast of north america. steller's sea cow was first discovered by europeans in 1741 and was hunted for meat and oil. the last sea cow was killed in 1768. that amounts to 27 years between the sea cows first contact with europeans and extinction of the species. in 1914, the last living passenger pigeon died in a zoo in cincinnati, ohio. this species had once darkened the skies of north america during its migrations, but it was hunted and suffered from habitat loss through the clearing of forests for farmland. in 1918, the last living carolina parakeet died in captivity. this species was once common in the eastern united states, but it suffered from habitat loss. the species was also hunted because it ate orchard fruit when its native foods were destroyed to make way for farmland. the japanese sea lion, which inhabited a broad area around japan and the coast of korea, became extinct in the 1950s due to fishermen. the caribbean monk seal was distributed throughout the caribbean sea but was driven to extinction via hunting by 1952. these are only a few of the recorded extinctions in the past 500 years. the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) keeps a list of extinct and endangered species called the red list. the list is not complete, but it describes 380 extinct species of vertebrates after 1500 ad, 86 of which were driven extinct by overhunting or overfishing. estimates of extinction rates are hampered by the fact that most extinctions are probably happening without observation. the extinction of a bird or mammal is likely to be noticed by humans, especially if it has been hunted or used in some other way. but there are many organisms that are of less interest to humans (not necessarily of less value) and many that are undescribed. the background extinction rate is estimated to be about one per million species per year (e/msy). for example, assuming there are about ten million species in existence, the expectation is that ten species would become extinct each year (each year represents ten million species per year). one contemporary extinction rate estimate uses the extinctions in the written record since the year 1500. for birds alone this method yields an estimate of 26 e/msy. however, this value may be underestimated for three reasons. first, many species would not have been described until much later in the time period, so their loss would have gone unnoticed. second, the number of recently extinct species is increasing because extinct species now are being described from skeletal remains. and third, some species are probably already extinct even though conservationists are reluctant to name them as such. taking these factors into account raises the estimated extinction rate closer to 100 e/msy. the predicted rate by the end of the century is 1500 e/msy. a second approach to estimating present-time extinction rates is to correlate species loss with habitat loss by measuring forest-area loss and understanding species-area relationships. the species-area relationship is the rate at which new species are seen when the area surveyed is increased. studies have shown that the number of species present increases as the size of the island increases. this phenomenon has also been shown to hold true in other habitats as well. turning this relationship around, if the habitat area is reduced, the number of species living there will also decline. estimates of extinction rates based on habitat loss and species-area relationships have suggested that with about 90 percent habitat loss an expected 50 percent of species would become extinct. species-area estimates have led to species extinction rate calculations of about 1000 e/msy and higher. in general, actual observations do not show this amount of loss and suggestions have been made that there is a delay in extinction. recent work has also called into question the applicability of the species-area relationship when estimating the loss of species. this work argues that the species-area relationship leads to an overestimate of extinction rates. a better relationship to use may be the endemics-area relationship. using this method would bring estimates down to around 500 e/msy in the coming century. note that this value is still 500 times the background rate. biodiversity exists at multiple levels of organization and is measured in different ways depending on the goals of those taking the measurements. these measurements include numbers of species, genetic diversity, chemical diversity, and ecosystem diversity. the number of described species is estimated to be 1.5 million with about 17,000 new species being described each year. estimates for the total number of species on earth vary but are on the order of 10 million. biodiversity is negatively correlated with latitude for most taxa, meaning that biodiversity is higher in the tropics. the mechanism for this pattern is not known with certainty, but several plausible hypotheses have been advanced. five mass extinctions with losses of more than 50 percent of extant species are observable in the fossil record. biodiversity recovery times after mass extinctions vary, but have been up to 30 million years. recent extinctions are recorded in written history and are the basis for one method of estimating contemporary extinction rates. the other method uses measures of habitat loss and species-area relationships. estimates of contemporary extinction rates vary, but some rates are as high as 500 times the background rate, as determined from the fossil record, and are predicted to rise.","[('extinction', 'extinctions'), ('biogeographer', 'biogeographers'), ('biodiversity crisi', 'biodiversity crises', 'biodiversity crisis'), ('extinction

250,stax-bio,47,Conservation Biology and Biodiversity,2,m44894,The Importance of Biodiversity to Human Life,"it may not be clear why biologists are concerned about biodiversity loss. when biodiversity loss is thought of as the extinction of the passenger pigeon, the dodo bird, and even the woolly mammoth, the loss may appear to be an emotional one. but is the loss practically important for the welfare of the human species? from the perspective of evolution and ecology, the loss of a particular individual species is unimportant (however, the loss of a keystone species can lead to ecological disaster). extinction is a normal part of macroevolution. but the accelerated extinction rate means the loss of tens of thousands of species within our lifetimes, and it is likely to have dramatic effects on human welfare through the collapse of ecosystems and in added costs to maintain food production, clean air and water, and human health. agriculture began after early hunter-gatherer societies first settled in one place and heavily modified their immediate environment. this cultural transition has made it difficult for humans to recognize their dependence on undomesticated living things on the planet. biologists recognize the human species is embedded in ecosystems and is dependent on them, just as every other species on the planet is dependent. technology smoothes out the extremes of existence, but ultimately the human species cannot exist without its ecosystem. contemporary societies that live close to the land often have a broad knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants growing in their area. most plants produce secondary plant compounds, which are toxins used to protect the plant from insects and other animals that eat them, but some of which also work as medication. for centuries in europe, older knowledge about the medical uses of plants was compiled in herbalsbooks that identified plants and their uses. humans are not the only species to use plants for medicinal reasons: the great apes, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas have all been observed self-medicating with plants. modern pharmaceutical science also recognizes the importance of these plant compounds. examples of significant medicines derived from plant compounds include aspirin, codeine, digoxin, atropine, and vincristine ([link]). many medicines were once derived from plant extracts but are now synthesized. it is estimated that, at one time, 25 percent of modern drugs contained at least one plant extract. that number has probably decreased to about 10 percent as natural plant ingredients are replaced by synthetic versions. antibiotics, which are responsible for extraordinary improvements in health and lifespans in developed countries, are compounds largely derived from fungi and bacteria. in recent years, animal venoms and poisons have excited intense research for their medicinal potential. by 2007, the fda had approved five drugs based on animal toxins to treat diseases such as hypertension, chronic pain, and diabetes. another five drugs are undergoing clinical trials, and at least six drugs are being used in other countries. other toxins under investigation come from mammals, snakes, lizards, various amphibians, fish, snails, octopuses, and scorpions. aside from representing billions of dollars in profits, these medicines improve peoples lives. pharmaceutical companies are actively looking for new compounds synthesized by living organisms that can function as medicine. it is estimated that 1/3 of pharmaceutical research and development is spent on natural compounds and that about 35 percent of new drugs brought to market between 1981 and 2002 were from natural compounds. the opportunities for new medications will be reduced in direct proportion to the disappearance of species. since the beginning of human agriculture more than 10,000 years ago, human groups have been breeding and selecting crop varieties. this crop diversity matched the cultural diversity of highly subdivided populations of humans. for example, potatoes were domesticated beginning around 7,000 years ago in the central andes of peru and bolivia. the potatoes grown in that region belong to seven species and the number of varieties likely is in the thousands. each variety has been bred to thrive at particular elevations and soil and climate conditions. the diversity is driven by the diverse demands of the topography, the limited movement of people, and the demands created by crop rotation for different varieties that will do well in different fields. potatoes are only one example of human-generated diversity. every plant, animal, and fungus that has been cultivated by humans has been bred from original wild ancestor species into diverse varieties arising from the demands for food value, adaptation to growing conditions, and resistance to pests. the potato demonstrates a well-known example of the risks of low crop diversity: the tragic irish potato famine when the single variety grown in ireland became susceptible to a potato blight, wiping out the crop. the loss of the crop led to famine, death, and mass emigration. resistance to disease is a chief benefit to maintaining crop biodiversity, and lack of diversity in contemporary crop species carries similar risks. seed companies, which are the source of most crop varieties in developed countries, must continually breed new varieties to keep up with evolving pest organisms. these same seed companies, however, have participated in the decline of the number of varieties available as they focus on selling fewer varieties in more areas of the world. the ability to create new crop varieties relies on the diversity of varieties available and the accessibility of wild forms related to the crop plant. these wild forms are often the source of new gene variants that can be bred with existing varieties to create varieties with new attributes. loss of wild species related to a crop will mean the loss of potential in crop improvement. maintaining the genetic diversity of wild species related to domesticated species ensures our continued food supply. since the 1920s, government agriculture departments have maintained seed banks of crop varieties as a way to maintain crop diversity. this system has flaws because, over time, seed banks are lost through accidents, and there is no way to replace them. in 2008, the svalbard global seed vault ([link]) began storing seeds from around the world as a backup system to the regional seed banks. if a regional seed bank stores varieties in svalbard, losses can be replaced from svalbard. the seed vault is located deep into the rock of  an arctic island. conditions within the vault are maintained at ideal temperature and humidity for seed survival, but the deep underground location of the vault in the arctic means that failure of the vaults systems will not compromise the climatic conditions inside the vault. crop success s is largely dependent on the quality of the soil. although some agricultural soils are rendered sterile using controversial cultivation and chemical treatments, most contain a huge diversity of organisms that maintain nutrient cyclesbreaking down organic matter into nutrient compounds that crops need for growth. these organisms also maintain soil texture that affects water and oxygen dynamics in the soil that are necessary for plant growth. if farmers had to maintain arable soil using alternate means, the cost of food would be much higher than it is now. these kinds of processes are called ecosystem services. they occur within ecosystems, such as soil ecosystems, as a result of the diverse metabolic activities of the organisms living there, but they provide benefits to human food production, drinking water availability, and breathable air. other key ecosystem services related to food production are plant pollination and crop pest control. over 150 crops in the united states require pollination to produce. one estimate of the benefit of honeybee pollination within the united states is $1.6 billion per year; other pollinators contribute up to $6.7 billion more. many honeybee populations are managed by apiarists who rent out their hives services to farmers. honeybee populations in north america have been suffering large losses caused by a syndrome known as colony collapse disorder, whose cause is unclear. other pollinators include a diverse array of other bee species and various insects and birds. loss of these species would make growing crops requiring pollination impossible, increasing dependence on other crops. finally, humans compete for their food with crop pests, most of which are insects. pesticides control these competitors; however, pesticides  are costly and lose their effectiveness over time as pest populations adapt. they also lead to collateral damage by killing non-pest species and risking the health of consumers and agricultural workers. ecologists believe that the bulk of the work in removing pests is actually done by predators and parasites of those pests, but the impact has not been well studied. a review found that in 74 percent of studies that looked for an effect of landscape complexity on natural enemies of pests, the greater the complexity, the greater the effect of pest-suppressing organisms. an experimental study found that introducing multiple enemies of pea aphids (an important alfalfa pest) increased the yield of alfalfa significantly. this study shows the importance of landscape diversity via the question of whether a diversity of pests is more effective at control than one single pest; the results showed this to be the case. loss of diversity in pest enemies will inevitably make it more difficult and costly to grow food. in addition to growing crops and raising animals for food, humans obtain food resources from wild populations, primarily fish populations. for approximately 1 billion people, aquatic resources provide the main source of animal protein. but since 1990, global fish production has declined. despite considerable effort, few fisheries on the planet are managed for sustainability. fishery extinctions rarely lead to complete extinction of the harvested species, but rather to a radical restructuring of the marine ecosystem in which a dominant species is so over-harvested that it becomes a minor player, ecologically. in addition to humans losing the food source, these alterations affect many other species in ways that are difficult or impossible to predict. the collapse of fisheries has dramatic and long-lasting effects on local populations that work in the fishery. in addition, the loss of an inexpensive protein source to populations that cannot afford to replace it will increase the cost of living and limit societies in other ways. in general, the fish taken from fisheries have shifted to smaller species as larger species are fished to extinction. the ultimate outcome could clearly be the loss of aquatic systems as food sources. finally, it has been argued that humans benefit psychologically from living in a biodiverse world. a chief proponent of this idea is entomologist e. o. wilson. he argues that human evolutionary history has adapted us to live in a natural environment and that built environments generate stressors that affect human health and well-being. there is considerable research into the psychological regenerative benefits of natural landscapes that suggests the hypothesis may hold some truth. in addition, there is a moral argument that humans have a responsibility to inflict as little harm as possible on other species. humans use many compounds that were first discovered or derived from living organisms as medicines: secondary plant compounds, animal toxins, and antibiotics produced by bacteria and fungi. more medicines are expected to be discovered in nature. loss of biodiversity will impact the number of pharmaceuticals available to humans. crop diversity is a requirement for food security, and it is being lost. the loss of wild relatives to crops also threatens breeders abilities to create new varieties. ecosystems provide ecosystem services that support human agriculture: pollination, nutrient cycling, pest control, and soil development and maintenance. loss of biodiversity threatens these ecosystem services and risks making food production more expensive or impossible. wild food sources are mainly aquatic, but few are being managed for sustainability. fisheries ability to provide protein to human populations is threatened when extinction occurs. biodiversity may provide important psychological benefits to humans. additionally, there are moral arguments for the maintenance of biodiversity.","[('agricultural diversity', 'agricultural diversities'), ('secondary plant compound', 'secondary plant compoundss', 'secondary plant

251,stax-bio,47,Conservation Biology and Biodiversity,3,m44896,Threats to Biodiversity,"the core threat to biodiversity on the planet, and therefore a threat to human welfare, is the combination of human population growth and resource exploitation. the human population requires resources to survive and grow, and those resources are being removed unsustainably from the environment. the three greatest proximate threats to biodiversity are habitat loss, overharvesting, and introduction of exotic species. the first two of these are a direct result of human population growth and resource use. the third results from increased mobility and trade. a fourth major cause of extinction, anthropogenic climate change, has not yet had a large impact, but it is predicted to become significant during this century. global climate change is also a consequence of human population needs for energy and the use of fossil fuels to meet those needs ([link]). environmental issues, such as toxic pollution, have specific targeted effects on species, but they are not generally seen as threats at the magnitude of the others. humans rely on technology to modify their environment and replace certain functions that were once performed by the natural ecosystem. other species cannot do this. elimination of their ecosystemwhether it is a forest, a desert, a grassland, a freshwater estuarine, or a marine environmentwill kill the individuals in the species. remove the entire habitat within the range of a species and, unless they are one of the few species that do well in human-built environments, the species will become extinct. human destruction of habitats accelerated in the latter half of the twentieth century. consider the exceptional biodiversity of sumatra: it is home to one species of orangutan, a species of critically endangered elephant, and the sumatran tiger, but half of sumatras forest is now gone. the neighboring island of borneo, home to the other species of orangutan, has lost a similar area of forest. forest loss continues in protected areas of borneo. the orangutan in borneo is listed as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature (iucn), but it is simply the most visible of thousands of species that will not survive the disappearance of the forests of borneo. the forests are removed for timber and to plant palm oil plantations ([link]). palm oil is used in many products including food products, cosmetics, and biodiesel in europe. a five-year estimate of global forest cover loss for the years 20002005 was 3.1 percent. in the humid tropics where forest loss is primarily from timber extraction, 272,000 km2 was lost out of a global total of 11,564,000 km2 (or 2.4 percent). in the tropics, these losses certainly also represent the extinction of species because of high levels of endemism. preventing habitat destruction with wise wood choicesmost consumers do not imagine that the home improvement products they buy might be contributing to habitat loss and species extinctions. yet the market for illegally harvested tropical timber is huge, and the wood products often find themselves in building supply stores in the united states. one estimate is that 10 percent of the imported timber stream in the united states, which is the worlds largest consumer of wood products, is potentially illegally logged. in 2006, this amounted to $3.6 billion in wood products. most of the illegal products are imported from countries that act as intermediaries and are not the originators of the wood. how is it possible to determine if a wood product, such as flooring, was harvested sustainably or even legally? the forest stewardship council (fsc) certifies sustainably harvested forest products, therefore, looking for their certification on flooring and other hardwood products is one way to ensure that the wood has not been taken illegally from a tropical forest. certification applies to specific products, not to a producer; some producers products may not have certification while other products are certified. while there are other industry-backed certifications other than the fsc, these are unreliable due to lack of independence from the industry. another approach is to buy domestic wood species. while it would be great if there was a list of legal versus illegal wood products, it is not that simple. logging and forest management laws vary from country to country; what is illegal in one country may be legal in another. where and how a product is harvested and whether the forest from which it comes is being maintained sustainably all factor into whether a wood product will be certified by the fsc. it is always a good idea to ask questions about where a wood product came from and how the supplier knows that it was harvested legally. habitat destruction can affect ecosystems other than forests. rivers and streams are important ecosystems and are frequently modified through land development and from damming or water removal. damming of rivers affects the water flow and access to all parts of a river. differing flow regimes can reduce or eliminate populations that are adapted to these changes in flow patterns. for example, an estimated 91percent of river lengths in the united states have been developed: they have modifications like dams, to create energy or store water; levees, to prevent flooding; or dredging or rerouting, to create land that is more suitable for human development. many fish species in the united states, especially rare species or species with restricted distributions, have seen declines caused by river damming and habitat loss. research has confirmed that species of amphibians that must carry out parts of their life cycles in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats have a greater chance of suffering population declines and extinction because of the increased likelihood that one of their habitats or access between them will be lost. overharvesting is a serious threat to many species, but particularly to aquatic species. there are many examples of regulated commercial fisheries monitored by fisheries scientists that have nevertheless collapsed. the western atlantic cod fishery is the most spectacular recent collapse. while it was a hugely productive fishery for 400 years, the introduction of modern factory trawlers in the 1980s and the pressure on the fishery led to it becoming unsustainable. the causes of fishery collapse are both economic and political in nature. most fisheries are managed as a common (shared) resource even when the fishing territory lies within a countrys territorial waters. common resources are subject to an economic pressure known as the tragedy of the commons in which essentially no fisher has a motivation to exercise restraint in harvesting a fishery when it is not owned by that fisher. the natural outcome of harvests of resources held in common is their overexploitation. while large fisheries are regulated to attempt to avoid this pressure, it still exists in the background. this overexploitation is exacerbated when access to the fishery is open and unregulated and when technology gives fishers the ability to overfish. in a few fisheries, the biological growth of the resource is less than the potential growth of the profits made from fishing if that time and money were invested elsewhere. in these caseswhales are an exampleeconomic forces will always drive toward fishing the population to extinction. for the most part, fishery extinction is not equivalent to biological extinctionthe last fish of a species is rarely fished out of the ocean. at the same time, fishery extinction is still harmful to fish species and their ecosystems. there are some instances in which true extinction is a possibility. whales have slow-growing populations and are at risk of complete extinction through hunting. there are some species of sharks with restricted distributions that are at risk of extinction. the groupers are another population of generally slow-growing fishes that, in the caribbean, includes a number of species that are at risk of extinction from overfishing. coral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems that face peril from several processes. reefs are home to 1/3 of the worlds marine fish speciesabout 4,000 speciesdespite making up only 1 percent of marine habitat. most home marine aquaria are stocked with wild-caught organisms, not cultured organisms. although no species is known to have been driven extinct by the pet trade in marine species, there are studies showing that populations of some species have declined in response to harvesting, indicating that the harvest is not sustainable at those levels. there are concerns about the effect of the pet trade on some terrestrial species such as turtles, amphibians, birds, plants, and even the orangutan. bush meat is the generic term used for wild animals killed for food. hunting is practiced throughout the world, but hunting practices, particularly in equatorial africa and parts of asia, are believed to threaten several species with extinction. traditionally, bush meat in africa was hunted to feed families directly; however, recent commercialization of the practice now has bush meat available in grocery stores, which has increased harvest rates to the level of unsustainability. additionally, human population growth has increased the need for protein foods that are not being met from agriculture. species threatened by the bush meat trade are mostly mammals including many primates living in the congo basin. exotic species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans into an ecosystem in which they did not evolve. such introductions likely occur frequently as natural phenomena. for example, kudzu (pueraria lobata), which is native to japan, was introduced in the united states in 1876. it was later planted for soil conservation. problematically, it grows too well in the southeastern united statesup to a foot a day. it is now a pest species and covers over 7 million acres in the southeastern united states. if an introduced species is able to survive in its new habitat, that introduction is now reflected in the observed range of the species. human transportation of people and goods, including the intentional transport of organisms for trade, has dramatically increased the introduction of species into new ecosystems, sometimes at distances that are well beyond the capacity of the species to ever travel itself and outside the range of the species natural predators. most exotic species introductions probably fail because of the low number of individuals introduced or poor adaptation to the ecosystem they enter. some species, however, possess preadaptations that can make them especially successful in a new ecosystem. these exotic species often undergo dramatic population increases in their new habitat and reset the ecological conditions in the new environment, threatening the species that exist there. for this reason, exotic species are also called invasive species. exotic species can threaten other species through competition for resources, predation, or disease. lakes and islands are particularly vulnerable to extinction threats from introduced species. in lake victoria, as mentioned earlier, the intentional introduction of the nile perch was largely responsible for the extinction of about 200 species of cichlids. the accidental introduction of the brown tree snake via aircraft ([link]) from the solomon islands to guam in 1950 has led to the extinction of three species of birds and three to five species of reptiles endemic to the island. several other species are still threatened. the brown tree snake is adept at exploiting human transportation as a means to migrate; one was even found on an aircraft arriving in corpus christi, texas. constant vigilance on the part of airport, military, and commercial aircraft personnel is required to prevent the snake from moving from guam to other islands in the pacific, especially hawaii. islands do not make up a large area of land on the globe, but they do contain a disproportionate number of endemic species because of their isolation from mainland ancestors. it now appears that the global decline in amphibian species recognized in the 1990s is, in some part, caused by the fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis ([link]). there is evidence that the fungus is native to africa and may have been spread throughout the world by transport of a commonly used laboratory and pet species: the african clawed toad (xenopus laevis). it may well be that biologists themselves are responsible for spreading this disease worldwide. the north american bullfrog, rana catesbeiana, which has also been widely introduced as a food animal but which easily escapes captivity, survives most infections of batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and can act as a reservoir for the disease. early evidence suggests that another fungal pathogen, geomyces destructans, introduced from europe is responsible for white-nose syndrome, which infects cave-hibernating bats in eastern north america and has spread from a point of origin in western new york state ([link]). the disease has decimated bat populations and threatens extinction of species already listed as endangered: the indiana bat, myotis sodalis, and potentially the virginia big-eared bat, corynorhinus townsendii virginianus. how the fungus was introduced is unclear, but one logical presumption would be that recreational cavers unintentionally brought the fungus on clothes or equipment from europe. climate change, and specifically the anthropogenic (meaning, caused by humans) warming trend presently underway, is recognized as a major extinction threat, particularly when combined with other threats such as habitat loss. scientists disagree about the likely magnitude of the effects, with extinction rate estimates ranging from 15 percent to 40 percent of species committed to extinction by 2050. scientists do agree, however, that climate change will alter regional climates, including rainfall and snowfall patterns, making habitats less hospitable to the species living in them. the warming trend will shift colder climates toward the north and south poles, forcing species to move with their adapted climate norms while facing habitat gaps along the way. the shifting ranges will impose new competitive regimes on species as they find themselves in contact with other species not present in their historic range. one such unexpected species contact is between polar bears and grizzly bears. previously, these two species had separate ranges. now, their ranges are overlapping and there are documented cases of these two species mating and producing viable offspring. changing climates also throw off species delicate timing adaptations to seasonal food resources and breeding times. many contemporary mismatches to shifts in resource availability and timing have already been documented. range shifts are already being observed: for example, some european bird species ranges have moved 91 km northward. the same study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the populations are not moving quickly enough. range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects, freshwater fishes, reptiles, and mammals. climate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating the habitat for those species adapted to the highest elevations. some climates will completely disappear. the rate of warming appears to be accelerated in the arctic, which is recognized as a serious threat to polar bear populations that require sea ice to hunt seals during the winter months: seals are the only source of protein available to polar bears. a trend to decreasing sea ice coverage has occurred since observations began in the mid-twentieth century. the rate of decline observed in recent years is far greater than previously predicted by climate models. finally, global warming will raise ocean levels due to melt water from glaciers and the greater volume of warmer water. shorelines will be inundated, reducing island size, which will have an effect on some species, and a number of islands will disappear entirely. additionally, the gradual melting and subsequent refreezing of the poles, glaciers, and higher elevation mountainsa cycle that has provided freshwater to environments for centurieswill also be jeopardized. this could result in an overabundance of salt water and a shortage of fresh water. the core threats to biodiversity are human population growth and unsustainable resource use. to date, the most significant causes of extinctions are habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and overharvesting. climate change is predicted to be a significant cause of extinctions in the coming century. habitat loss occurs through deforestation, damming of rivers, and other activities. overharvesting is a threat particularly to aquatic species, while the taking of bush meat in the humid tropics threatens many species in asia, africa, and the americas. exotic species have been the cause of a number of extinctions and are especially damaging to islands and lakes. exotic species introductions are increasing because of the increased mobility of human populations and growing global trade and transportation. climate change is forcing range changes that may lead to extinction. it is also affecting adaptations to the timing of resource availability that negatively affects species in seasonal environments. the impacts of climate change are greatest in the arctic. global warming will also raise sea levels, eliminating some islands and reducing the area of all others.","[('wood product', 'wood productss', 'wood products'), ('tragedy of the common', 'tragedy of the commons', 'tragedy of the commons', 'tragedies of the common', 'tragedies of the

252,stax-bio,47,Conservation Biology and Biodiversity,4,m44898,Preserving Biodiversity,"preserving biodiversity is an extraordinary challenge that must be met by greater understanding of biodiversity itself, changes in human behavior and beliefs, and various preservation strategies. the technology of molecular genetics and data processing and storage are maturing to the point where cataloguing the planets species in an accessible way is close to feasible. dna barcoding is one molecular genetic method, which takes advantage of rapid evolution in a mitochondrial gene present in eukaryotes, excepting the plants, to identify species using the sequence of portions of the gene. plants may be barcoded using a combination of chloroplast genes. rapid mass sequencing machines make the molecular genetics portion of the work relatively inexpensive and quick. computer resources store and make available the large volumes of data. projects are currently underway to use dna barcoding to catalog museum specimens, which have already been named and studied, as well as testing the method on less studied groups. as of mid 2012, close to 150,000 named species had been barcoded. early studies suggest there are significant numbers of undescribed species that looked too much like sibling species to previously be recognized as different. these now can be identified with dna barcoding. numerous computer databases now provide information about named species and a framework for adding new species. however, as already noted, at the present rate of description of new species, it will take close to 500 years before the complete catalog of life is known. many, perhaps most, species on the planet do not have that much time. there is also the problem of understanding which species known to science are threatened and to what degree they are threatened. this task is carried out by the non-profit iucn which, as previously mentioned, maintains the red listan online listing of endangered species categorized by taxonomy, type of threat, and other criteria ([link]). the red list is supported by scientific research. in 2011, the list contained 61,000 species, all with supporting documentation. legislation throughout the world has been enacted to protect species. the legislation includes international treaties as well as national and state laws. the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites) treaty came into force in 1975. the treaty, and the national legislation that supports it, provides a legal framework for preventing approximately 33,000 listed species from being transported across nations borders, thus protecting them from being caught or killed when international trade is involved. the treaty is limited in its reach because it only deals with international movement of organisms or their parts. it is also limited by various countries ability or willingness to enforce the treaty and supporting legislation. the illegal trade in organisms and their parts is probably a market in the hundreds of millions of dollars. illegal wildlife trade is monitored by another non-profit: trade records analysis of flora and fauna in commerce (traffic). within many countries there are laws that protect endangered species and regulate hunting and fishing. in the united states, the endangered species act (esa) was enacted in 1973. species at risk are listed by the act; the u.s. fish & wildlife service is required by law to develop management plans that protect the listed species and bring them back to sustainable numbers. the act, and others like it in other countries, is a useful tool, but it suffers because it is often difficult to get a species listed, or to get an effective management plan in place once it is listed. additionally, species may be controversially taken off the list without necessarily having had a change in their situation. more fundamentally, the approach to protecting individual species rather than entire ecosystems is both inefficient and focuses efforts on a few highly visible and often charismatic species, perhaps at the expense of other species that go unprotected. at the same time, the act has a critical habitat provision outlined in the recovery mechanism that may benefit species other than the one targeted for management. the migratory bird treaty act (mbta) is an agreement between the united states and canada that was signed into law in 1918 in response to declines in north american bird species caused by hunting. the act now lists over 800 protected species. it makes it illegal to disturb or kill the protected species or distribute their parts (much of the hunting of birds in the past was for their feathers). the international response to global warming has been mixed. the kyoto protocol, an international agreement that came out of the united nations framework convention on climate change that committed countries to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2012, was ratified by some countries, but spurned by others. two important countries in terms of their potential impact that did not ratify the kyoto protocol were the united states and china. the united states rejected it as a result of a powerful fossil fuel industry and china because of a concern it would stifle the nations growth. some goals for reduction in greenhouse gasses were met and exceeded by individual countries, but worldwide, the effort to limit greenhouse gas production is not succeeding. the intended replacement for the kyoto protocol has not materialized because governments cannot agree on timelines and benchmarks. meanwhile, climate scientists predict the resulting costs to human societies and biodiversity will be high. as already mentioned, the private non-profit sector plays a large role in the conservation effort both in north america and around the world. the approaches range from species-specific organizations to the broadly focused iucn and traffic. the nature conservancy takes a novel approach. it purchases land and protects it in an attempt to set up preserves for ecosystems. ultimately, human behavior will change when human values change. at present, the growing urbanization of the human population is a force that poses challenges to the valuing of biodiversity. establishment of wildlife and ecosystem preserves is one of the key tools in conservation efforts. a preserve is an area of land set aside with varying degrees of protection for the organisms that exist within the boundaries of the preserve. preserves can be effective in the short term for protecting both species and ecosystems, but they face challenges that scientists are still exploring to strengthen their viability as long-term solutions. due to the way protected lands are allocated (they tend to contain less economically valuable resources rather than being set aside specifically for the species or ecosystems at risk) and the way biodiversity is distributed, determining a target percentage of land or marine habitat that should be protected to maintain biodiversity levels is challenging. the iucn world parks congress estimated that 11.5 percent of earths land surface was covered by preserves of various kinds in 2003. this area is greater than previous goals; however, it only represents 9 out of 14 recognized major biomes. research has shown that 12 percent of all species live only outside preserves; these percentages are much higher when only threatened species and high quality preserves are considered. for example, high quality preserves include only about 50 percent of threatened amphibian species. the conclusion must be that either the percentage of area protected must increase, or the percentage of high quality preserves must increase, or preserves must be targeted with greater attention to biodiversity protection. researchers argue that more attention to the latter solution is required. there has been extensive research into optimal preserve designs for maintaining biodiversity. the fundamental principle behind much of the research has been the seminal theoretical work of robert h. macarthur and edward o. wilson published in 1967 on island biogeography.1 this work sought to understand the factors affecting biodiversity on islands. the fundamental conclusion was that biodiversity on an island was a function of the origin of species through migration, speciation, and extinction on that island. islands farther from a mainland are harder to get to, so migration is lower and the equilibrium number of species is lower. within island populations, evidence suggests that the number of species gradually increases to a level similar to the numbers on the mainland from which the species is suspected to have migrated. in addition, smaller islands are harder to find, so their immigration rates for new species are lower. smaller islands are also less geographically diverse so there are fewer niches to promote speciation. and finally, smaller islands support smaller populations, so the probability of extinction is higher. as islands get larger, the number of species accelerates, although the effect of island area on species numbers is not a direct correlation. conservation preserves can be seen as islands of habitat within an ocean of non-habitat. for a species to persist in a preserve, the preserve must be large enough. the critical size depends, in part, on the home range that is characteristic of the species. a preserve for wolves, which range hundreds of kilometers, must be much larger than a preserve for butterflies, which might range within ten kilometers during its lifetime. but larger preserves have more core area of optimal habitat for individual species, they have more niches to support more species, and they attract more species because they can be found and reached more easily. preserves perform better when there are buffer zones around them of suboptimal habitat. the buffer allows organisms to exit the boundaries of the preserve without immediate negative consequences from predation or lack of resources. one large preserve is better than the same area of several smaller preserves because there is more core habitat unaffected by edges. for this same reason, preserves in the shape of a square or circle will be better than a preserve with many thin arms. if preserves must be smaller, then providing wildlife corridors between them so that individuals and their genes can move between the preserves, for example along rivers and streams, will make the smaller preserves behave more like a large one. all of these factors are taken into consideration when planning the nature of a preserve before the land is set aside. in addition to the physical, biological, and ecological specifications of a preserve, there are a variety of policy, legislative, and enforcement specifications related to uses of the preserve for functions other than protection of species. these can include anything from timber extraction, mineral extraction, regulated hunting, human habitation, and nondestructive human recreation. many of these policy decisions are made based on political pressures rather than conservation considerations. in some cases, wildlife protection policies have been so strict that subsistence-living indigenous populations have been forced from ancestral lands that fell within a preserve. in other cases, even if a preserve is designed to protect wildlife, if the protections are not or cannot be enforced, the preserve status will have little meaning in the face of illegal poaching and timber extraction. this is a widespread problem with preserves in areas of the tropics. some of the limitations on preserves as conservation tools are evident from the discussion of preserve design. political and economic pressures typically make preserves smaller, never larger, so setting aside areas that are large enough is difficult. if the area set aside is sufficiently large, there may not be sufficient area to create a buffer around the preserve. in this case, an area on the outer edges of the preserve inevitably becomes a riskier suboptimal habitat for the species in the preserve. enforcement of protections is also a significant issue in countries without the resources or political will to prevent poaching and illegal resource extraction. climate change will create inevitable problems with the location of preserves. the species within them will migrate to higher latitudes as the habitat of the preserve becomes less favorable. scientists are planning for the effects of global warming on future preserves and striving to predict the need for new preserves to accommodate anticipated changes to habitats; however, the end effectiveness is tenuous since these efforts are prediction based. finally, an argument can be made that conservation preserves reinforce the cultural perception that humans are separate from nature, can exist outside of it, and can only operate in ways that do damage to biodiversity. creating preserves reduces the pressure on human activities outside the preserves to be sustainable and non-damaging to biodiversity. ultimately, the political, economic, and human demographic pressures will degrade and reduce the size of conservation preserves if the activities outside them are not altered to be less damaging to biodiversity. habitat restoration holds considerable promise as a mechanism for restoring and maintaining biodiversity. of course once a species has become extinct, its restoration is impossible. however, restoration can improve the biodiversity of degraded ecosystems. reintroducing wolves, a top predator, to yellowstone national park in 1995 led to dramatic changes in the ecosystem that increased biodiversity. the wolves ([link]) function to suppress elk and coyote populations and provide more abundant resources to the guild of carrion eaters. reducing elk populations has allowed revegetation of riparian areas, which has increased the diversity of species in that habitat. decreasing the coyote population has increased the populations of species that were previously suppressed by this predator. the number of species of carrion eaters has increased because of the predatory activities of the wolves. in this habitat, the wolf is a keystone species, meaning a species that is instrumental in maintaining diversity in an ecosystem. removing a keystone species from an ecological community may cause a collapse in diversity. the results from the yellowstone experiment suggest that restoring a keystone species can have the effect of restoring biodiversity in the community. ecologists have argued for the identification of keystone species where possible and for focusing protection efforts on those species; likewise, it also makes sense to attempt to return them to their ecosystem if they have been removed. other large-scale restoration experiments underway involve dam removal. in the united states, since the mid-1980s, many aging dams are being considered for removal rather than replacement because of shifting beliefs about the ecological value of free-flowing rivers and because many dams no longer provide the benefit and functions that they did when they were first built. the measured benefits of dam removal include restoration of naturally fluctuating water levels (the purpose of dams is frequently to reduce variation in river flows), which leads to increased fish diversity and improved water quality. in the pacific northwest, dam removal projects are expected to increase populations of salmon, which is considered a keystone species because it transports key nutrients to inland ecosystems during its annual spawning migrations. in other regions such as the atlantic coast, dam removal has allowed the return of spawning anadromous fish species (species that are born in fresh water, live most of their lives in salt water, and return to fresh water to spawn). some of the largest dam removal projects have yet to occur or have happened too recently for the consequences to be measured. the large-scale ecological experiments that these removal projects constitute will provide valuable data for other dam projects slated either for removal or construction. zoos have sought to play a role in conservation efforts both through captive breeding programs and education. the transformation of the missions of zoos from collection and exhibition facilities to organizations that are dedicated to conservation is ongoing. in general, it has been recognized that, except in some specific targeted cases, captive breeding programs for endangered species are inefficient and often prone to failure when the species are reintroduced to the wild. zoo facilities are far too limited to contemplate captive breeding programs for the numbers of species that are now at risk. education is another potential positive impact of zoos on conservation efforts, particularly given the global trend to urbanization and the consequent reduction in contacts between people and wildlife. a number of studies have been performed to look at the effectiveness of zoos on peoples attitudes and actions regarding conservation; at present, the results tend to be mixed. new technological methods such as dna barcoding and information processing and accessibility are facilitating the cataloging of the planets biodiversity. there is also a legislative framework for biodiversity protection. international treaties such as cites regulate the transportation of endangered species across international borders. legislation within individual countries protecting species and agreements on global warming have had limited success; there is at present no international agreement on targets for greenhouse gas emissions. in the united states, the endangered species act protects listed species but is hampered by procedural difficulties and a focus on individual species. the migratory bird act is an agreement between canada and the united states to protect migratory birds. the non-profit sector is also very active in conservation efforts in a variety of ways. conservation preserves are a major tool in biodiversity protection. presently, 11percent of earths land surface is protected in some way. the science of island biogeography has informed the optimal design of preserves; however, preserves have limitations imposed by political and economic forces. in addition, climate change will limit the effectiveness of preserves in the future. a downside of preserves is that they may lessen the pressure on human societies to function more sustainably outside the preserves. habitat restoration has the potential to restore ecosystems to previous biodiversity levels before species become extinct. examples of restoration include reintroduction of keystone species and removal of dams on rivers. zoos have attempted to take a more active role in conservation and can have a limited role in captive breeding programs. zoos also may have a useful role in education.","[('dna barcoding', 'dna
